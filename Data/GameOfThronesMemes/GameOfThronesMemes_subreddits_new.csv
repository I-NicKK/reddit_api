Starting from Game Of Thrones season 1 as nothing but a lonely bastard to slowly rise through the ranks of the night's watch, to finding his true love when Jon snow and ygritte met and I did not leave Jon snow and Daenerys out by mistake. Leading to the ultimate story ark culmination of him being chosen to be the King In The North.
