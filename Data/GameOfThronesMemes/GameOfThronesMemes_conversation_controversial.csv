Would it have been more effective if there were a few more episodes in both 7 and 8 to flesh out a few things? Most likely, but overall I was left with nothing more than a solid feeling of satisfaction. 

&#x200B;

Honestly, despite some weaker writing at times, this season's been amazing, especially the cinematography, action, special effects and some genuinely brilliant acting from all the cast. I feel than Peter Dinklage brought his A-game for the finale, and Kit Harrington's choice that he had to make felt real and incredibly powerful.

&#x200B;

Is it a perfect ending? I don't quite think so, but again I feel the biggest criticism against it is a lack of time. But I'm just one fan, and this is just one viewpoint. Everyone's got there own take-away after all, their own thoughts and feelings on this franchise. It's basically impossible to end a show with this large of an ensemble cast in a way that would please every single viewer.

This season doesn't suck because the outcomes are bad, it sucks because the continuity is bad.","And screwing with Prohecy is what GRRM is all about, but when he does it, it's more about things turning out differently than expected (A ""prince that was promised"" being a ""princess,"" what ""the little brother"" means, etc) or that some prophecies/curses are true and have weight, others are total shit, but what is important is how those beliefs change people, how they motivate them, and how the plot is shaped by them (self fulfilling?)

&#x200B;

This was just awful.","Although I do agree that there were flagrant  inconsistencies and I understand /respect your position, I'd like to point out that yes the scorpions were downgraded from a repeated bolt action weapon that can reload within seconds to a terribly slow arbalet.

For the clegane bowl, mistake me if I'm wrong but if you were talking about Gregor killing Qyburn then of course it was easily enough he's a frail old man with no fighting experience who was caught off guard. If you were talking about how he killed Oberyn, he was not a brutish fighter he couldn't withstand big blows that's why he was fighting with a spear and used quickness and agility to defeat his foes. As for Sandor, he's a brute of a man by all means of physical aspects speaking. His head is bigger and stronger than other's, but I agree he should have at least had his skull done to bits when he was getting the back of his uncovered head hit repeatedly on the rocks. It was a decent scene not terrible but not great at least from continuity speaking.

Jaimie always had doubts and worries he was never fully converted, this is not star wars it makes sense that'd he'd go back to his sister. He's emotionally damaged, has no real future, no wealth and no reason to fight for Dany. I'm pretty sure even GRRM would not have opted for a full redemption because it'd be too tropy. Although I wished for him to kill his sister I understand he could never have done it. But the fact is Euron should have killed him it wasn't even close, seeing all those vital organ hits. And the fact that he managed to find cersei was pure and utter bullshit.","As for Dany, that's a bit more complicated, yes the sheer level of destruction that she was able to cause was never trully shown or hinted at before in the series. But it was hinted in previous seasons ever since the beginning that she wasn't mentally stable and that she was leaning towards her destructive side.

She has lost everyone she loved or gotten betrayed by them. You have to realize she's very young even in the shows so she takes stuff extremely personally. She doesn't give a flying fuck anymore, even if she gets the crown that she has always thought was hers by right she has lost everything along the way.

This doesn't excuse her actions but neither is it weirdly off the top to imagine she'd go bezerker mode. Although her destroying all the ballistas were bullshit, the lannister archers were useless.","The scorpions were capable of killing an injured dragon that wasn't expecting them to be there. They were caught totally by surprise.

Dany went cray-cray and didn't listen to Jon or Tyrion.

Jamie's love for Cersei never died and he always did stupid and/or evil things for her sake. When it came to life or death for Westeros, he chose to fight for life but otherwise, his character arc mostly involved trying to save Cersei from her own worst tendencies (including on that topic.)

Dexter was tragic, in that it was SO GOOD but the last few season gave you no action and he became an idiot. At least there's action in Game Of Thrones.",Dexter was WAY worse. I hated that whole season so much.,Almost as if this was a happy story all along?,*casual,Right? And when peoe have been complaining not enough deaths she never used the dragon etc. Then they complain that's not what we wanted right the show how we want lol they'd complain if they were using with a new rope😂,"Such a prick. Literally. He did all of this because he knew how to be king and did it.
The only good thing from this: Jon got what he deserved - to be free.",I 100% agree!,Quit bitching,watch something else,It was actually cersei,I simply ignore the existence of everything after Ep6.,[removed],[removed],[removed],Original.,"Well maybe GRRM should have finished his story so we wouldn't have a situation where the show ""ran out of books"".","It may not be the ending we wanted, but maybe its the ending we deserve.",Hahahaha,Elaborate if you would.,That’s true tho ,D&D fucked her up. ,Sansa is good chracter. :-\,Nothing to change.,Agree,Sansa bad. Everyone else good,You’re dumb. I can’t debate dumb.,Not with that attitude you can’t.,She’s a whiny little girl throughout the entire story with no backbone and she drowns herself in her own fear. She prays for a Florian to rescue her while she does nothing for herself. She’s dumb. She could have tried to do something for herself but she hasn’t. She is only important because of her last name while she does nothing to show she’s a Stark but continue breathing. She does whatever she’s told. She could be mute and nobody would notice the difference. Need I rant more on the awful character that is Sansa Stark?,"The point of the statement was to provoke an answer. Doesn’t always work, but sometimes you have to be rude to get shit done :)","How far are you in the show? Because I agree with you to a point in the show, but after that she’s very definitely not what you just described ",I’ve read all of the books and seen all of the show. She doesn’t think for herself ever. She lets little finger sell her off. She’s a complete pushover when he takes her to her aunt and won’t even tell Hernandez own blood who she is. When she runs away with Theon it takes THE MOST DESTROYED character to motivate her to save her own life by running. Smh Hodor is a better character ,"Okay. Well yes. When she’s a child she doesn’t have a backbone.? What child would after watching her dad be beheaded in front of an angry mob? Then she’s confused because she doesn’t know what she should do, because again...SHE’S A CHILD... But how about the time she won the battle of the bastards by bringing in the knights of the Vale? Or the time fed Ramsey to his fucking dogs? It’s called character development dude, she’s growing up in an incredibly hard situation and when she puts her foot down shit gets real. I’m glad you’ve read all the books, but you gotta understand what makes characters act the way they are. I agree that Willis is a better character though, so you got that going for you. 
I don’t know how to tag spoilers, so sorry if you haven’t seen the show",Yeah she had her moments but let’s not forget Aryas a KID and most arguably the most BADASS one. Sansa definitely redeemed some honor by feeding homeboy to his dogs but I’d have to agree with the others. She’s sorta annoying and literally whined and cried her way to season 7 ,"Bottom line is... Sansa IS an awful character. Her character development is a tad bit slow but that doesn’t make her any better. She only did two in that show that makes an fan happy but that’s it. Unless she decides to grow fucking balls in the last season. Otherwise, her character IS awful. ","Yes Arya’s a kid, but stronger than Sansa. And wasn’t left to the lions in Kings landing, she was smuggled across the world. I’m not saying she’s not annoying, I’m just saying that as far as character development goes, she’s a good character. ","So, you do realize that This argument can also be made about Dany correct? Take away the dragons, army, advisors, and she’s still the same girl her brother sold to the horse people. Dany didn’t watch her dad die like Sansa did, Dany wasn’t mocked and abused every second of every day, she had people there to make her the badass bitch she is today. Sansa is learning how to be independent at the moment in the show, so I’m not saying she’s the best character ever but she sure as shit grew balls last season. If you had your entire family slaughtered in front of you at what.. 12? and then you were mocked and paraded around a castle like a beat dog, would you stand up for yourself? No, you wouldn’t. You’d act like a cockless Theon, like Sansa, who preceded to spend maybe a year killing off the people that took advantage of her that she could reach before winter arrived. She lured little finger into helping the starks and then killed him in front of his men, knowing if they didn’t agree with the decision they’d walk right over the force that Ramsey would’ve wiped out had she not made her own decision. I’m not saying she’s the best in the show but she’s sure fucking better than Tommen, that creepy kid from the Vale, Rickon(because you people don’t understand these are CHILDREN), Marcella, and the carstark girl and that little boy whose name doesn’t matter. ","Yes, I agree. The only interesting thing Danny’s gat going on are her dragons. And the fact that she’s got an army. Otherwise she too is an annoying character. And I get where you’re coming from. Our perspective on how good/bad Sansa is are different. At the end of the day opinions are opinions and I respect yours.

I thought I was replying to a meme ><,Lol thank you for the link.,Hodor.,"What can happen now ?

The North will say it has no armies but will find one out of the blue during episode 4. Episode 5 is the battle between that newly formed army and Cersei's mercenary army. 

The battle ends with lots of people dying, and episode 6 is just winners picking up the pieces and reunifying the 7 kingdoms. 

Only thing left to surprise us is if Cersei or Jon Snow comes out victorious of the battle and which major characters live and which switch camps at the last minute.",I fucking shat myself,"Damn, Euron must be huge like an elephant",Aryaa 😱 my word is taken back S08E2,This aged poorly.,Then don't.,Done...,This is why we cant have nice things.,"His arc literally ended the exact same way it started, he's in love with Cersei and will do anything, even die, for that love. If you end up in the exact same place, the arc is ruined because there was no progression.","Sure, when you boil it down to its most base level there's no progression. Just like how Arya went from a girl who didn't want to be a lady to a girl who didn't want to be a lady. Harry potter went from a boy who would do anything to protect his friends to a young man who would do anything to protect his friends. It's amazing how no characters change ever.

Honestly if you can't see how he evolved idek what show you were watching. At the start he was arrogant and cocky, and willing to die for cercei because he loved her and he couldn't see her madness. In the end he saw how evil she was, but in spite of that he still loved her and their child.

Or in other words, S1 Jaime would have stayed in kings landing the whole time and fought to kill the invaders. S8 Jaime fought to protect those he loved from the living dead, and then returned to them and tried to save them, having no more interest in fighting.","I understand your point but Cersei is everything wrong with Jaime, and a huge part of his arc was realising that. The fact that he spent seasons heading in this direction and then just decided that actually no he didn't feel like that anymore was unsatisfying. I don't think I would have minded if they spent some time and actually showed some reasoning as to how he could come to the conclusion that his leaving Cersei was a mistake, but instead we spent years watching Jaime decide to leave and then he's just back in the space of a few episodes without so much as even talking about it.

The only conversation Jaime has about going back to Cersei is him explaining that he hasn't changed at all and he is evil just like Cersei and that's why they're meant to be, which was his whole arc being thrown out the window in one short monologue.",No. They completely and carefully changed his character over time and then said in one scene never mind all that stuff you've watched for years.,"Watching fans twist the obvious here is sad. This whole show turned to shit. Once they killed the night king without explaining ANYTHING, like why he needs to kill Bran there was no chance for redemption. Half of what we learned in this show turned out to be worthless. Nothing matters. The dead killed almost everyone in winterfell. No they didn't. Scorpians kill dragons. No they don't. What?

I don't care if Jamie goes back to Cersei. I don't care if Danny is bad. Those things are fine but they have to write that and not something else. What they did to wrap this show up is fucking crazy.",This gives. Literally all the context clues. Also saw this before the episode.,My excitement went up when the bells were ringing. Then it went wayyyyyy up when Daenerys started burning everyone. Then went through the roof when Cleganebowl happened. Then it went down went Cersei met her demise the way she did.,"I agree this season if anything has made me love it even more! But honestly the more I think about it the better her death becomes to me. Like think about it, if any other character tried to kill her we would've got same old cersei showing no fear and acting like nothings wrong. But with Jaimee she is most vulnerable and lets her true feelings go and we get to see when she knows she is finally fd how freaking terrified she really is of dying. Idk to me that is SUPER cathartic.",Hmmm. You make a really good point.,"Thanks ya idk I was pissed at first too but then the more I thought about it the more I was like ""yes that's right cry because you're screwed and finally there is no escape""😂",Say it! Who gave the order?! Say it!,No,No,"Me too, normie pride",It was amazing.,"Well, the action and all was great. Actors did a great job too.

As long as you dont care for the story and writng, youre good. This is how I'm able to watch transformer movies or similar too ;)",People are just stupid enough to have trust in daenerys. They are showing us how crazy she can be for 8 seasons!,Same. Not the best season but this last episode is at least giving closure on foreshadowing in the earlier seasons.,"It's not really Daenerys going mad that bothers me.

I read a lot of fantasy and, see here, a good plot twist occurs when the story keeps the viewer/reader distracted enough to not draw attention to the foreshadow it scatters concerning the plot twist. A good plot twist takes you by surprise, but you can always backtrack it to see where it all originated. This was not a plot twist to begin with, let alone a good one, because it was a narrative choice done for shock value.

Daenerys has known loss before, terrible loss and yet she never went as far as killing a SINGLE innocent person (someone who didn't deserve the retribution she gave them). The fact that she isn't phased by her torching of King's Landing, goes against the layers and layers of characterization built up for her in the previous seasons.

This is what truly bothers me. Instead of building up her madness properly and subtly, the season draws attention to Dany's instability for the entirety of season 8 and then just like that, snaps and goes mad. ""Lazy writing"" is probably too gentle a term to call this. And there is nothing more I hate more in my stories than lazy writing.",This essay was lazy writing,"If reading 3 paragraphs is too much for you, then you, sir, can find your equals in grade-school. ;)",[deleted],even if the last few episodes dissapointed. I'm glad those two made the show that i got so invested in that i'm here bitching about this show after every episode,Yeah I will remember this show for all good moments like Scrubs.,"Finally.

S8 isn't perfect, but by the wailing and gnashing of teeth around here you would think D&D tortured their dogs to death.","And as much as people like to shit on their writing, let's not forget how many scenes thay added that are pretty damn highly regarded. Tywin and Arya's scenes were show original. Half the Queen of Thrones scenes were show only as well. All the scenes or Varys and Little Finger in their one on one verbal spars. Seeing Theon turn down and made into Reek. A good portion of The Hound and Arya's scenes in the show are either new or play out differently in the novels (for example it's an infected cut that brings The Hound down in the novels, not a fight with Brienne).

They've written alot of great scenes and episodes. Problem is unlike George they couldn't take an **over 8 year break** to figure out how they want to wrap things up.",Thank you. Reddit has become a ridiculous echo chamber for those who complain. The vast majority of viewers still love this show.,Seriously! Thanks for saying it. These guys had an impossible job amd killed it.,Fuuuuck this so much lol,Yas😭😭,That's a remarkably positive spin on a terrible ending. Good on ya.,Scrubs ended okay if you don't count the shitty reboot.,"Well, a dog was mistreated...",but they could have get more eps and they didnt want to,"I think the vast majority love the show as a whole.

Also I wouldnt say everyone in kingslanding landing was innocent. Also still hold them responsible for ned starks death too so they can all burn for all I care.",The people just like severed heads. They don't really know what's happening or care.,Do you hold literal infants responsible for Ned's death too? Because she burned them indiscriminately,"They cheered for his death because they thought he betrayed their king. I dont think the survivors of Kings Landing would feel too good about Daenerys. We all saw Sam's reaction when he learned that Dany burnt his father and brother. Well, there are many Sam's now. Killing common folk is not going to prove fruitful politically (at the very least).",My point exactly. I hope they like their flesh crispy,"Methyl groups attach themselves into DNA that cause changes which can pass through generations ergo no I don't hold them responsible, but they may still have the genetic changes that caused those people to see an innocent man beheaded😉.","Cersei barely even knew Dany, she just assumed no one would stoop as low as she had.","I think that season 6 was very good, but I feel a bit alone seeing all these memes....",Hahaha I would agree that season 6 wasnt quite as sparse as this drawing,When she says she fights for the people of the realm,Lol,"Ummm... almost no one was waiting all 8 seasons for that... you know, on account of her being underage for a portion of it.","Sansa may be pretty and all, but she is not the hottest person in the show, that title goes to Hot Pie.","No lie, I thought your title said ""I hate titties""",You have my upvote😂,Lmao,Can I get in f in the chat for this loss?,"And yet, we got Arya Stark instead..",#got #gameofthrones #gotseason8 #finale #starwars #starwarsmemes #gameofthronesmemes #meme #anakinskywalker #theforce #dracarys #breakerofchains #daenerystargaryen #tyrionlannister #obiwankenobi #natalieportman #emiliaclarke #iceandfire #goodandevil,So Brave.,"##r/GOT

GoT viewers: this has got to be the WORST season of TV ever produced what are the writers thinking are they braindead",In the vision there appeared to be snow falling. My friends and I assumed this meant winter came to King's Landing. But after this last episode I now realize that it was probably ash.,you mean peoples egos,That's not what it's about at all. Garbage writing isn't suddenly good because it's unexpected,"that's what we all believed.  However, this vision of devastation proves that from the beginning it was expected that Daeherys would go crazy.",Also,A horny chick? She had sex ONCE. Replace that with a highly skilled assassin who began training very young.,Apparently since half the memes in this sub are praising her. Shit was cash and totally the way it should have ended.,"So, OP... who did YOU want to kill him? 
She's the only one in winterfell with the assassin skillset in addition to being many(mine too) favorite char.","You survive the destruction of your house, travel over seas to become a faceless assassin, and irradicates the house that murdered your brother and mother...but you have sex ONE TIME and now you're the horny chick","Probably because he was so arrogant to think no one could hurt him. The dude always flexed on everyone and thought security above himself. And instead of using tactic, he just throws his people at the enemy in the hope that it works.  The staring contest with Bran is just one big silent villain monolog. He intentionally waits to kill Bran and always walks like he has all time in the fucking world.

It's his own fault hed died and he had it coming. Arrogance and underestemating his opponents were his downfall, in my opinion. He never considered that the element of surprise could also be used by the opponent.","I personally loved it. It was the perfect amount of anti-climatic. Sure a sword fight between him and Jon would have been cool, but it would also have been terribly cliche and a sad way to end a series that's not afraid to go against the norm.",She is the most badass.  Why would you be disappointed?,I just wish Jon got to fight NK for a few moments but failed and fight before NK deals the final blow Arya swoops in for the same ending. That would have been epic.,[removed],"Agree with anyone disappointed. Not that Arya shouldn't have been the one to do it - just that the Night King was completely anonymous for literally years.
Didn't say a word. Never engaged in combat directly. Just kinda sad really",Yes,"Yes, you are",That ending was so Disney-like.,"And she used none of that training to kill the night king. Motherfucker, if I wasn't a bitch and afraid of heights I could have climbed that tree, jumped down and killed him too. I have no problem with Arya killing him but ffs writers, at least have her use the badass faceless assassin stuff that she learned. It 100% would have been better if the Night King got out his sword and was about to swing and Bran does some ninja dodge and stabs him with the knife. The Night King looks up at him confused and he takes his face off to reveal Arya.",It's almost like everyone loves Arya as a character and totally want that to go down like that.,It just wasn't delivered in a believable way. Such Hollywood BS. Not to mention how so many main characters had plot armor.,"I kinda feel OP, I kinda wanted to see a sword fight, or at least the big baddies go ham. I feel like Jon Snow and the night king didn't do enough for a proper climax and the ending left me like ""oh .. that's it?""","It's not about Arya, it's about how easily he was killed. All that build up for 7 seasons and one jump he dies","I get you bro, but there are many Arya fans to bash us here","Got the same thought, but can't say that after endgame","She could only do it because she was so quiet, that was her training. I would have made so much noise adjusting myself up in a tree lol.",bran is marked. The NK would have known it wasn't the real bran if it went that way...,Dude she pulled the same move on Brienne. They literally showed us she can do it.,"Same. I'm all for her taking out the night king because shes badass,but it just seemed like Jon vs the NK was a fated battle since their first meeting at Hardhome.","Exactly my point, it wasnt about Arya killing it was the timing. Night king was hyped as the biggest threat to westeros. And all he did was so predictable, he straight up fell for brans trap and there was no fight, no major death involved in this. Atleast they gave him a badass smirk moment which I have to live with. Sad he ended so easily","Game of Thrones isn't supposed to be predictable. So this unpredicted element feels quite nice IMO. It came as a shock. Really, who would have been shocked by a sword fight between the Night King and John? It was expected, therefore less dramatic and impactful. I, personally prefer this death for him, although there are unresolved questions.

Edit: spelling","Awe. You  wanted a sword fight.  :(
Sorry, not enough time.  They ate too much of time showing a pitch black screen.","That's exactly it. I really like Arya and how the character evolved through the series, but come on this is the night king who commands and has commanded all of the fucking undead army for so long, and he dies in such a stupid way? Cheap B- writing.

I expected Bran to have Valyrian steel shards on his useless ravens and warg them as homing missiles against the night king and his council or something. Anything. Such an anticlimactic ending after such a long build up...","To be fair, Arya was the character I almost expected the least killing the NK.",You can make as many excuses as you want for bad writing but it doesn't change the fact that her killing him had 0 pay off for her arc whatsoever. I can't believe I actually still hoped that they would do this show justice. Absolute garbage.,"True, I literally typed the first alternative that popped into my head. They could have hidden him somewhere close by, like digging a pit underneath where he was sat and covering it over to trick the NK. Alternatively she could have been disguised as a WW and killed him. I still think it would be anti-climactic but both of these options would have been more satisfying.","When did I ever state that she can't, I just said it that it was badly written. They seriously want me to be hype about something they set up only in the previous season. Ffs, come on.","Yeah but a surprise attack is the ONLY way he was going down, I feel","Well, to be fair, he handed literally everyone at Winterfell their collective arses, including Arya, and it wasn't until she visited the bonfire halfway through the episode that she recovered enough to round 2 and pierce his Dark soul.

Certainly, being merciless to her enemies was always her MO.  If the showrunners had put some more plot points making her feel that the people themselves were her enemy, then that would make sense. (For example, if the people of KL were more complicit somehow in Missandei's death - say they were all there cheering or something)","I expected her to burn the city, but I gave the writers way too much credit thinking they would provide a good reason for her to.

The battle was over.  She won then decided, ""lulz, time to kill innocents because reasons!!!1""","She's literally a POW / rape victim who has seen nothing but war and destruction for her entire adult life.  She crucified people, burned people alive, locked people in a vault to die of starvation.   Motherfuckers must have the attention span of a fucking gnat.","I mean, all this shit happened kinda fast in real life. She just found out her claim was illegitimate right before the Battle of Winterfell and after that everything rapidly spiraled into abyss of shit for her in spite of the victory vs. The Night King. It's not like she was getting therapy for PTSD after being literally moments away from getting ripped apart by the undead, having her child suddenly killed, having her best friend beheaded... Someone with a lot of firepower, a massive wounded ego, can't trust anyone and has a family history of insanity snapping under the circumstances should not be remotely surprising. Even Jon betrayed and rejected her when she needed him most. Grey Worm is pretty much the only surviving person she can trust now.",Well she considered the possibility of doing it if it was necessary to take the city. Definitely not killing them just randomly when the battle is won,"""I will burn cities to the ground"" pretty hard to do that without killing a few innocents...","She clearly snapped because of all the shit she's been put through the past few weeks. She's crazy. 

People act like the writers rushed her descent into madness, didn't show her emotional isolation from and lack of trust in even her closest advisers and her resentment towards a Westeros that never accepted her the way her now-depleted armies did? And that all her dreams and sacrifices were for a mission that is now rendered illegitimate by her own lover?

No good reasons to snap and start fucking shit up?","I think the lack of understanding how people dont buy her turn is a lack of understanding of mental health. Your points just demonstrate that she does fucked up shit sometimes which is true of almost every character. Doing ""mad"" things doesnt make you go insane. They're confusing being emotionally angry with madness.","Nope, not all at.

She. Had. Won.

It was over and nothing that happened to her explains how she went from winning the crown straight to genocide just for the lulz.","Yeah, that showed that in about 2, maybe 3 scenes lol","I'd also like to point out that this is a fantasy character. It could be that she destroyed the red keep to burn any remaining caches of wildfire.  IMHO, the idea that she did something passionately callous isn't really all that different from just batshit crazy - at least in the narrative arc of her character development.","She snapped. There isn't necessarily an explanation for what people do when they snap, but the situation leading up to that makes snapping kind of understandable, and it's probably a genetic propensity too - just needed some kindling for that fire. 

I honestly think she hates Westeros and its people who will never respect her (especially if they know her claim is illegitimate), so making them fear her was her only option left. Plus, you never know if a surrender is a trap set by Cersei...","Pretty much all the events of the entire season were foreshadowing this turn. She was unwelcome from the start in the city she brought her loyal armies to die protecting. Countless Unsullied died protecting the Northern army's retreat back into Winterfell. She wasn't getting any thank yous for this sacrifice after the battle. Sansa hates her and was clearly conspiring to get Dany removed from leadership. Varys was trying to murder her. Tyrion fucked up a ton of times. Jon refused to not tell anyone about his claim even though it would destroy Dany's life work and mission. And these are her ""friends.""

A series of highly traumatic events, rushing to take King's Landing instead of allowing the wounded to recover, not eating anything, Tyrion and Varys openly questioning her sanity and even Jon showing signs of concern, not agreeing to NOT burn the city to the ground, signaling to Grey Worm to ""wait for her signal"". All of this was very well set up. If you think it was rushed, it's because she snapped due to a lot of concurrent events which happened in a very short period of time.","> I honestly think she hates Westeros and its people who will never respect her (especially if they know her claim is illegitimate), so making them fear her was her only option left. Plus, you never know if a surrender is a trap set by Cersei...

This right here.  Especially since Cersei didn't really surrender and only a few of the Lannister army had even thrown down their weapons.   I was fully expecting a Cersei trap since she would never surrender.",I agree with you. I tried to explain the same thing to a coworker today and he didn't get it but I totally agree with you,"Bad things happening to her isn't foreshadowing lol, and that's exactly the problem. None of this was set up in her character at all, at least none before the ending of episode 4. She went from completely fine to genocide in 3, maybe 4 scenes where she actually speaks or at least appears. 

No one is saying her going mad is completely out of the realm of possibility. I personally don't like it but that doesn't make it a bad thing. But them showing nothing about it, and suddenly in episode time making her burn down half a million people is ridiculous. You can't just flip a switch and say ""this character is crazy now"" with no build up other than ""this season sucked for her, and earlier this episode she looked a bit uglier than usual""","Seriously, she's weak (lost two dragons, most of her loyal soldiers and advisors), paranoid (and rightly so given Varys was trying to poison her), unloved, vengeful, her life mission became meaningless, probably suffering from PTSD and has to watch her back for even Jon now. Everyone was noticing how unstable her judgement was. It's why Varys and Tyrion turned on her, and even Jon was starting to worry.

She just said ""fuck it, I'm going to show them how powerful I am. If they won't love me, they'll fear me."" When you're emotionally unstable, such logic makes sense.","Yah your right.In addition she isnt a hero like so many people believe. She leads the freaking dothraki and is the mother of dragons also know as monster. Dragons creatures know for bringing fear, death and destruction. And these are part of the tool set of the supposed ""hero""? No she is a conqueror all along. And now she is a conqueror who has no reliable advisors to fall on now.",General Reposti! You are an old one!,Are we blind? Deploy the downvotes!,"I honestly think season 6 was the best season handsdown, all with post-book content as well. 4-5 were shaky even with book content, and 7 was just as bad.",RIP,"So you sayin, that seasons 1-4 were horseshit?","yeah no shit man, its like a high school play with a massive budget now",Season 6 was good again.

Whether or not he did it for or in spite of Jon, Dany, or anyone else, is beside the point. He did what Dany talked about.",Is this a meme?,"Putting the two of them together is great, but I'm confused about why Jon is saying that, if he chose the plot, then it would be better.

She took whats hers by killing the ones who dont stand for the free folks. So she killed only those and freed the slaves. Thats what Dany was all about and did build up to over 6-7 seasons. She also never wanted to be compared to her mad father (he did build up his madness over years and years of killing everyone)

Now, jump forward to Season8 Ep5, Dany all of a sudden kills every innocent, instead of flying to cercei and only kill her to free the poor. And she got mad...why? Because noone likes her anymore? Makes no sense...

There was just no build up, except maybe 2-3 scenes. But well, it is what it is now.","She also indiscriminately crucified random members of the upper class, some of which actually fought against the crimes for which they were punished.  She fed a random guy to her dragon to send a message without a care as to his innocence of guilt.  We let those things slide because we felt like her cause was just.   But she has shown a capacity for mass murder and does not value individual lives.  She commited injustices in the name of justice and because we shared in her righteous anger, we have her a pass.  Turns out, she doesn't just kill people when she's right.  She also kills people when she's wrong. 

Her impulsive rage has been well documented.  The decline of her mental state has been well documented.  The show promised full Targaryen, it built up the threat of full Targaryen for 8 seasons and it had delivered full Targaryen.  And full Targaryen lived up to it's reputation.

When she was threatening to burn cities to the ground (starting as far back as Season 2), we cheered her on because she was talking to evil people.
