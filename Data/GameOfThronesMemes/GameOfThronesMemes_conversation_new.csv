Does he randomly show at some churches up and ask for your familyname what happend? Im interested to do also some research on my family.,"Pardon me my English. We had a time in history called Partitions if Poland when Russia, Austria and Prussia divided up our territory. And we didn't exist until the end of WWI. As a country - as the nation, Poles were much or less protecting themself of the russification or germanization.","I would have to ask him but I think majority of his job was going the churches, especially the churches where was our known family members baptised, or got married or died/were born. The churches normally may have the archives where they have the info. With infos about them he had some clues about the places of birth of the people (if they came from different place). The biggest problem here was Russian and German languages (we live at the old Russian-Prussian border in the north of Masovia region). 

He was also looking in the Internet for the people with our surname, and because it is really uncommon, the chances for the people for being our far-far family was quite big. Sometimes they refused to share the infos (probably being afraid of some testament heritage blah blah) but normally they do share at least the info for closest family.

It’s about accepting science. 


And you’re right the Earth does naturally go through cycles of warming and cooling. That’s not the issue. The issue is how fast it’s doing it and why. Throughout earths history the changes in CO2 happened gradually over thousands of years and was almost always the result of either massive volcano eruptions or asteroid impacts. In the last 200 years the CO2 levels almost doubled and there hasn’t been a massive asteroid impact or volcano eruptions in the scale required to change the global CO2 levels. 


And not a single scientist is saying the world would end so that’s just wrong.

EDIT: I see you’re not gonna respond anymore but I’ll leave this here for anyone who scrolls by. The reason that magic number 650,000 exists isn’t a coincidence. The earth doesn’t just change its CO2 levels unprovoked every 650,000 years. The 3rd biggest volcano in the world in Yellowstone erupts every ~640-650 thousand years releasing tons of carbon into the atmosphere. [Our current CO2 levels are higher than they’ve been in close to 1 million years.](https://www.google.com/search?q=average+co2+levels+global+thousands+of+years&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwj-mO7tgurkAhUV9qwKHXuLBvIQ2-cCegQIABAC&oq=average+co2+levels+global+thousands+of+years&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-img.3..33i299l2.6897.11722..11857...2.0..0.219.2908.0j19j2......0....1.........30i10.Ok_Sx6YQAhI&ei=gVeKXb7UHZXsswX7lpqQDw&bih=638&biw=375&prmd=nisv&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS815US815&hl=en-US#imgrc=f_0bbO0amUQRzM) We are the ones causing this. So essentially, since the beginning of the industrial revolution, our nonstop burning of oil, releasing carbon into the atmosphere 24/7 has lead to a higher atmospheric CO2 level than the levels after a supermassive volcano eruption.","Why do you think your opinion is worth more than the vast vast majority of climate scientists who agree that climate change is being accelerated by focil fuels.

They dedicate their life to studying and researching climate. I think we should listen to them.",Lol k sure thing.,"Plea with countries that put the most CO2 into the atmosphere. I'd say that the US isn't the worst pollutant in the globe. We don't have smog warnings that'll cause lung infections. That's China and Europe. We're not still pouring tons of nuclear waste from our broken reactors into the ocean, that's Japan. We're not consuming the majority of coal, that's Australia. While there's pollutants in the US, we're not the leading cause. Neither are we 2nd or 3rd.","Bare with me here for a moment. Im going to try to take you to Mordor before dropping you off at the Shire again. Hang tight:
Im in my mid 30s. I try to observe and stay current with things that are happening. And over the past several years, maybe even a decade or more, I've grown increasingly uncomfortable when children are used as props for a cause. And I see it as a desperate attempt to make someone sympathize for something. It's happened with fast food, it's still happening with guns, it's happening with climate change, it's happening too much. And I believe it's a last ditch desperate attempt to get a point across. It's fine if you don't see it that way. But while watching major news networks, they mostly peddle the same stories because ultimately they're owned by the same people. So I look for independent studies. If it take 9 out of 10 dentists to recommend chewing Trident gum, then it should take 9 out of 10 experts to show facts for what they're claiming and independent studies up the ass to have proof. And ultimately, leave government out of it. Look at how ""efficient"" DMVs are or how effective mandatory health insurance has been... if you believe these government run subjects are effective to begin with then we are already at a disagreement. But I digress. Im failing to see how a teenage girl from Sweden would woo American politicians one way or another because even if a GND was passed, the citizens would be the only ones forced to obey it. Politicians have never really obeyed civilian laws. Sure some may but most political people are the corrupt people we all bitch about one way or another. So if John Doe can't drive a car or fly a plane or eat beef because cow farts are bad, you know damn well that Political Pat will be smashing double cheeseburgers on their private jet while on their way to tell the next citizen what not to do while they continue to do such things. 
It doesn't take a law to be passed to convince people to change. If we had 9 out of 10 scientist step up and say ""Hey do x y z instead of a b c and it'll help"" then why not do that. 
There's an episode of Rick and Morty (the Ricklantis mixup) that, in my opinion, makes a slight joke about people using kids to make others feel bad. 
Cop Rick: Why is there a crib in here?
Cop Morty: Just somethin’ they do to make you feel bad.
This is the impression I get whenever children are used as the face of any debate. They do so to make you feel bad. And after it's all said and done, it's just back to ""Mortys killing Mortys"" and nothing really changes.",You're so good at ducking responsibility.,"“Neither are we 2nd and 3rd” Wrong again. [We have the 2nd highest carbon emissions. ](https://www.google.com/search?q=emissions+by+country&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS815US815&hl=en-US&prmd=inmv&sxsrf=ACYBGNS630zLLWJg4r1qsakuMf5nWfn2NA:1569368092732&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwibpcHdz-rkAhVSqJ4KHXKmB-EQ_AUoAXoECBAQAQ&biw=375&bih=638#imgrc=GX7nzAG4YJiekM) We make up 5% of the global population and produce 15% of the world’s emissions. 

Nuclear waste spills don’t contribute to climate change and it wasn’t intentional.


Australia’s energy grid relies more on coal than the US (80% vs 30%) but the US still burns a lot more coal in that 30% because we have a lot more people. [source ](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/energy/resources/coal-resources) 


Please for the love of god, back up your arguments with actual facts not just what you think feels like the right numbers.","I agree using children for political purposes is dumb and looks desperate but it’s not morally wrong or comparable to hitler youth when the topic at hand is climate change. They’re not using children as props to say a race is more pure than another or the country’s bloodline is superior. It’s about saving our only home. 

You’re absolutely correct the green new deal is absurd and will never pass. We should take sweeping, drastic measures to reduce emissions but the GND gets 3 major things wrong. 1) livestock accounts for 3% of emissions, much bigger beasts need to be addressed. 2) it’s anti nuclear energy even though it releases tons of energy,there’s virtually no emissions from it, and it’s clean. 3) you can’t just massively cut back on air travel, it’s too important to have fast reliable global transportation. Factories and fossil fuel energy plants should be the highest priority. 

As for your  “9 out of 10 dentists” argument [how’s 97 out of 100 scientists agree that climate change is man made?](https://www.google.com/amp/s/climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus.amp)",Im not saying climate change isn't man made. If climate change is that important then shove 97 out of 100 scientists into the media saying change your habits from this to that. Not some politicized child.,"You literally implied that our current climate patterns are inevitable because this happens every 640 thousand years and that we can’t do anything to fix it. If it’s man made we can fix it. 

And we’ve been shoving those 97 scientists in the media for years but nobody cares. They literally put a report together last month and put it on trumps desk saying here’s the problem, here’s how we know it’s because of us, here’s what we need to do. And he just says that it’s a hoax. And he’s in charge of the appointing people who control what we do about it. Rick Perry was appointed head of the department of energy and if he could fuck fossil fuels he would and he’s a climate change denier. 

And I still don’t see why people are so upset that a child has a stance on her future.","I should've elaborated on my thought in regards to the earthly cycle of 650k years. I believe that, no matter what, we'd be experiencing some changes due to what fossil records show. Might not have been CO2, could be anything.

Lol it was you that broke them up wasn't it!!! 😋,"I feel ya. But you know, in a way, Jon did become King.... King Beyond the Wall.",Very true!! I just wish it stuck around for me to watch it all lol,r/lostredditors,What is the need of being a cunt with that cat?,"Why is this in GOT memes? Also, that poor cat looks neglected.","I mean, even if it was for the good of the realm, he did murder the queen.

His punishment? joining the organization he willingly signed up for in the first place.

Still confused about why the Nights Watch still exist.  I mean, Wildlings have returned to their homeland in peace, and most likely don't want to raid and pillage villages anymore.  White Walkers and their zombies have been defeated.  A huge chunk of the wall is missing.

&#x200B;

So what exactly are they defending the 7 Kingdoms from?",😂😂,"Wildling/northerners relations would probably be pretty fucked. They’ve been enemies for years, and those feelings run deep.",They still need somewhere to send the bastards and rapists,"Grey Worm wants Jon executed for his crime. He and the North both know executing Jon will start another war. Neither side wants a war, so Grey Worm is forced to compromise. Jon has to live but he also has to be punished somehow. He also can’t just be kept in a prison for the rest of his life. The obvious way to do this is exile, and the obvious place to exile him is to the north. In the past, when people were exiled to the north, they joined the Nights Watch. They don’t think about it too hard, it’s a just way to appease Grey Worm, who is a foreigner and knows next to nothing about what the Nights Watch does. The Nights Watch no longer exists in the same capacity it used to, it’s just exile. 

Of course, once Grey Worm leaves Westeros, since the Nights Watch doesn’t actually exist, Jon could just come back right? There are two reasons I don’t think this would happen. One, this is a society where even the people who fought the Mad King hate Jaime. The lords of Westeros will never forgive Jon even though he did them a favor. But since the different Starks now control all of Westeros, they could just ignore their lords and let Jon come back anyway, which brings me to the second and most important point. Jon WANTS to live in the north with the freefolk. I don’t think I need to explain this point, if you have watched the show you should know it to be true. 

They bamboozled Grey Worm into thinking they are punishing Jon, when in reality they are giving him what he wants. The Nights Watch was traditionally a punishment, so they say that is where Jon is going to convince Grey Worm that he is being punished.","They just fought together in a war, a few times.  I think they're good, or at the very least they want nothing to do with each other","At first I was confused, until I realized... that’s Jaime fooking Lannister","“Keep it in the family, they said.”",They say incest runs in the family,I like how the golden hand moves to add extra sass,bruh,He must have got his ass kicked by Guile.,Did the first frame where they say “Jaime Lannister” not give it away immediately?,"I guess it does... to be honest, I didn’t open up the full picture, and on mobile the only part it cuts off is where it said “ah cmon Jaime Lannister” and the very bottom of the letters in the last frame",Sansa was was by far my least favorite Stark throughout the whole show. Bran got really fucking annoying once he turned into that three eyed fucker though so it's really hard to say which was worse,"John and Aria

Oh boy",I agree but I think Bran is the best stark who is alive in the 7 kingdoms only bc he have that super fucking power which is useless and you think that john snow is from stark or targerian ?,I don't consider Jon Snow either honestly. The Targaryan thing was a Chekhovs gun that never fired. I guess he would be a Stark but I've always considered him his own character,"That's true as the information that he was a targaryan, was useless !!","In norse mythology, Loki is adopted so it’s not that strange",I thought everyone knew Loki was adopted. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QEY_sqgzZQ,Damnit Ned,[Thor's the adopted one.](https://am21.akamaized.net/tms/cnt/uploads/2018/03/oddgodout.png),he's also adopted in the mcu,Sparrow.

Who would pass the bloody gate?",Forgot im still subbed here ty for reminding me to unsub,"I know this is a joke, but what really would have happened. I’m guessing Robert is still killed. Joffrey still becomes king. No one realizes that Joffrey is not a legitimate heir. He rules the 7 kingdoms as a tyrant. Stannis, Renley, and the North never wage rebellions. Danerys still becomes powerful after many years, but since the seven kingdoms are united maybe not strong enough? White Walkers still march south but end up wiping everyone out because Arya never got her training? Night King wins iron throne and Dany stays in Essos?","But the ring went south, Boromir had to go with the fellowship",Watching Ned Stark marshall the full force of the  Northern houses against the army of the dead would have been fucking awesome.,The best ending,Still better than season 8,"Would Ned Stark make a deal with the Wildlings to let them South? 

Would Balon still be enough of a moron to invade when the Northern army is still North and what happens to Theon then? 

Does Jon even go to the watch at this point if Ned doesn’t go south and does Ned finally tell him of his parentage?

Does this mean Sansas betrothal is off and if so will she or Robb marry someone in the North?

What will the Boltons do through all of this?","Well in the books she urges him to go south, alough with how little D and D seem to care about the books maybe it wouldn't have mattered 💁🏼‍♀️",He really didnt do well in the south.,Still a better ending than season eight.,The best ending 😃😁,still a better story than season 8,😂😂😂 lmao,"I mean Olenna killed Joffrey because she didn’t want Marjory to have to be with him, I could be wrong but I’m pretty sure that still would have happened even without Ned","> because Arya never got her training

Maybe she's visited by a mysterious red woman who sets her on her path?

>Dany stays in Essos

She was already in Westeros when the Night King crossed the wall, so realistically they would have battled somewhere further south. Hard to say how that would have played out.",I think Stannis & Renly would've both rebelled against Joffrey being King. Especially with the red lady around Stannis hyping him up.,The only reason the NK got through the wall was because of Tyrion’s stupid plan to bring a corpse back. Now if they used Bran’s mark to sort of disenchant the wall then that would be different but apparently the NK is stuck without a dragon.,"If Dany has her dragons she'd still be strong enough. I also think someone would figure out Joffrey is a bastard eventually, Lannisters can't kill everyone who made a connection fast enough.",IT IS A GIFT,Eventually Olenna would have been the most powerful person because of Margaery being queen to Tommen and essentially holding off Cersei’s power.,"Agree. So we get King Tommen. High Sparrow sequence still happens. Then we get Cersei. Then Stannis, Renley, and the North rebel, albeit a few years later. Major change is that likely Ned is leading the Northern army and Robb stays back to hold Winterfell. No red wedding, but perhaps something interesting between Robb and Theon?","Yeah because Stannis pretty much knew about Joffrey’s illegitimacy because he investigated with Jon Arryn before fleeing King’s Landing before the start of the series.

And Renly almost definitely knew like everyone else in King’s Landing, he just wasn’t stupid enough to tell Cersei that he knew.",What would be stopping Cersei from using the wildfire to destroy the sept still though?,"Hmm that’s a tricky one, would have to mean the High Sparrow still rose in power thanks to Cersei and so far nothing changes that, so I guess you’re right!",Nonetheless the night king would win in this scenario.,Stick with pointy ‘em the end?,Lol,could be five times 50k if they did it right,Seems like karma begging but okay...,"Can we please just let this go and remember the good times?

Edit: oh.. I see now.   He was raising his son named Bran","Bran was never explained, especially his powers.","Bran is dead. He died in the cave with the Three Eyed Raven. The Three Eyed Raven is a legitimized Targaryen bastard, Brynden Rivers (Targaryen) / Lord Blood Raven. The Three Eyed Raven wanted to be king. He needed a body. A body that would not appear threatening to the world. 

Who better than a crippled boy. Although Brynden Rivers Targaryen has no loyalty to the Targaryen’s anymore than Bran does to the Starks, because he’s dead. His loyalty is to himself for revenge and blood. The Three Eyed Raven is a beast. Who will feast on humans. 

Brynden is a Greenseer, Skinchanger, Warger, and Sorcerer. He can cause people to go mad if he wargs into them. Or go dumb like Hodor did and will use it to his advantage to achieve his goals. Which was to be king. He’s also a carnivore. He ate Jojen to increase his Greenseeing powers. He eats humans and animals. 

Brynden Rivers Targaryen is Jon and Daenerys’ uncle. The Targaryen dynasty imploded (was starting to unravel before this) when Brynden was sent to the NW by Jon and Daenerys’ grandfather, King Aegon V Targaryen for committing murder. And It was for revenge that Brynden sent Jon/Aegon back to the NW for murdering Daenerys. Jon was a lot like his grandfather. Probably why Maester Aemon gave both Aegon’s the same speech. Maester Aemon could probably sense in some weird, magical Targaryen way who Jon was.",I miss being excited for a new GOT season. For all the theories and news.

Not a bad dude to have as king.",Me too ..,"Which might be what happened in season 7 and 8, we just don't fucking know, cause it was never explained","You're really simplyfying this, his powers not only aren't explained but contridict what he says. Even what you just said, I can disprove with what he says in the show.","Bran isn't ""God"" or at least we don't have enough material to support that. We know he  gets his information from birds (for now), we know he gets visions of the past, present and future but can't tell which is which.

He also saved Sansa and Yara.

I feel like you can defend someone without excusing past behavior and choices. He did the best that he could to make up for what he did/caused, knowing it would never ever be enough. He died a good man, even if he wasn’t always one.",I will not tolerate this slander of the character with the best arc.,Rickon’s death is indirectly Theon’s fault.,Also Theon: Saves Sansa from Ramsey,"He also kills 2 kids

And in the books the kids get flayed 

So he is far from a good man","Thank you. People defend Theon, but I can never see how you can excuse what he did",Those fuckers fucked up that show beyond comprehension,"No, he died as reek, and never became a good man imo",No one else comes close to how much effort he put in to redeeming himself while knowing full well it would never be enough.,As is Bran becoming the Raven and ultimately the king of Westeros.

In the highly unlikely event that Martin finishes the books and this happens at least it will have an explanation other than ‘Tyrion thinks it’s a good idea for some reason’.",It was Bran's own fault for running in a straight damn line.,Edit that emoji out right now or so help me gods,"He can do good things, that doesnt change that he has killed innocent children and the men who raised him, i really dont see how ppl can see him as a 'good man' , he wasnst, his character was complex yes but he wasnt a good or honorable man",I dont care about downvotes my friend,"Where we’re going, we don’t need roads",Done and btw i felt cringey seeing it too. Tbh i was drunk when i wrote it. Fack!,That's is totally true. He was good in the start but then he broke trust killed innocent people and children for his greed.,"Not even for greed, just to prove he was someone or some stupid shit like that idek he made me so angry and now after saving some girl and dying for bran ppl have forgotten what he has done","No one forgot what he did. And no one excuses it. But he payed for his mistakes and then some. The retribution, the guilt, the physical and mental torture, and then he still came around and saved Sansa and many others. You also have to remember that Theon spent most of his childhood as a prisoner of war. The Starks ripped him away from his family as a young boy to have leverage against Balon. Children who grow up being torn between two families usually end up more aggressive later in life. 

Believe it or not life is more complex than “he do bad thing so he bad.” There’s a big difference between a good person who makes a severe error in judgement and an evil psychopath (like Ramsey) who commits heinous crimes regularly and feels nothing about it.",Yeahh i remember to prove his father that he is someone and is powerful,Have an award. Best comment I’ve read. 😊,You actually changed my opinion about theon. Maybe he wasn't that bad.,"Still not a good man IMO, yeah he went trough a lot of pain and then saved some people , and he might have had remorse , but if i rape and kill a 2 year old and the same torture would happen to me and maybe id save my brother from something later in life, would you see me as a good man ? I think way too many people look at it too positively because irs a movie but reaalistically he really isnt all that good. (Sorry for my english i hope i could explain my point well enough)",Thanks kind stranger!,Damn people on ny post get awards but not me though. *xxxtentacion songs play in my mind*,"You say bc it’s a show we’re conditioned to think that way, but I think it’s the opposite. Movies, television and society itself usually paints a picture that there are only good people and evil people. Nothing else. But the truth is that the lines can be very blurred sometimes and Martin’s writing illustrates that very well. For example: everyone thinks that the Stark’s are the “good” and “honorable” characters, but in reality the are to blame for a lot. Example: Jaime killed the mad king because he thought it was the right thing to do, but then Ned demonized him for it and gave him the name “Kingslayer” making him feel like he was unworthy of being good. If Ned could’ve just put his narcissistic notion of honor to the side to see what Jaime really did, maybe he wouldn’t have ended up trying to kill Bran and maybe he would’ve stopped sleeping with his sister. Same goes for Theon. Roberts army was  viewed as the “good guys” but why would Theon feel that way. He saw his family members get butchered by them when he was a kid and basically got kidnapped by the Starks. 

Are some people inherently evil and irredeemable? Absolutely. But sometimes it is more complicated than that. You’re using the most extreme example possible, but if you told me you did that then yes, I would think you were a monster. But if you also told me you were raped and tortured through your entire childhood I might view you as a of a victim of circumstance as well.","But nobody knew why he killed the king, so that on himself. And if i was raped in my childhood you might vieuw me as a victim, but it happened after what theon did, so u have to think what u would feel if it happened after i raped and killed a little girl, u would think i deserved it, even if i show remorse","I think you missed the point I was trying to make, but I’m just gonna go ahead and disagree with you about Theon. He’s one of my favorite characters and I stand by it.",Nope for me it's always the first picture,Yeah especially spn,hahahah,It's always the first for me.,I only listen to it to remember when the show was good,The game of thrones' theme song started playing in my mind when i finished reading the meme.

No exceptions.,"Peeeeter!, Peeeter dinklage, Peterdinklage peterdinklage peterdinklage!",I too am having to do mental gymnastics to understand how Season 8 turned out to be so bad.,Haha! What an original and unique comment. Come look at this guys: season 8 bad!,"Nah, it's not that hard to understand. The ideas behind sesson 8 were solid, the problem is how you get to them. My guess is that George left them an outline of how he sees it all ending and they thought that was the whole plot then filled the rest with useless stuff",To be fair season 8 was shit.,"They didn’t say season 8 was bad. They said the intro visual was not as good. Which it wasn’t. Kings landing moved from where it originally was, it kept focusing on last hearth when we were there for less than 5 minutes etc. Plus it seemed redundant to change it in the last season.","He said also which implies this is an addition to something else.

Also of course it focused on Last Hearth and Kins Landing. We spent the entire season in Westeros they're not gonna slap on random locations are they",Last hearth was in less than five minutes of one episode yet it went back each time. It kept focusing on the wall being knocked down even though it didn’t really matter anymore,"The whole point of this season's intro was following the NK's advance, which is why we see the floor turning blue as the camera moves. He began at the wall (which was a massive deal in Westeros) and went through Last Hearth so once again, of course they're going to show it","Wasn't it like 150 years or am I dumb? I thought that Brynden Rivers was a young man during the Blackfyre rebellion wasn't he?

&#x200B;

EDIT: just checked and the wiki says he was 125 years old","In my opinion, Bran won’t be King for long in the books. All the Weirwood Trees are north since humans chopped them down in the south. Who rules the north? Sansa. If the books continue, I believe Bran and Jon will be at war because of Sansa. I think at that time their true identities will be revealed. Jon died. And was raised back from the dead. But as who? I don’t even think he is Jon nor Aegon at this point. And Bran, well he’s dead already. He’s an Old God who has been trying to kill humans for thousands of years with his Children of the Forrest. Now he rules over humans. Never shows emotions until he smirked and left the council meeting. I think the final battle will be between one God (Jon Snow/Argon Targaryen) against an Old God (Bran/Three Eyed Raven). I think Bran will raise Daenarys from her fatal wound to get revenge on Jon. 

Just my theory.

But I agree. Well played Bran. Causing all this chaos and madness to be King.",I feel like they got this confused with how long the white walkers slept.,Thats the plot of hereditary.,Unpopular opinion: I didn't give two shits about him appearing in the show,I didn’t know it was even him until people started throwing a fit. In terms of questionable scenes within the show it certainly didn’t strike me as one of the worst. I thought it was a decent scene showing the human side to the Lannister armies. Didn’t bother me at all lol.,And the fact that until that point there were only 2 songs sung in all of westeros...,"Unpopular opinion: I thought it was a nice sweet moment seeing him although it kinda broke some GOT immersion, it was still cool hearing a cute song from him in the show",I didn’t know who Ed Sheeran was until he was in Game of Thrones. Funny meme though.,Sadly everyone remembers,"I can surely understand what was the major issue: okay, he was ""Eddie"" but he wasn't portraying some different character than the person who he is. That was Ed Sheeran playing guitar in Westeros so the suspension of disbelief crumbled.

But yeah, didn't give a shit either.","I didn’t care either, but it was because I had never seen his picture or anything so I didn’t realize who it was! Literally just thought it was a random dude singing.",I think it's sad that people hated that moment because it was a surprise for Maisey.,So what does Pepperidge farm have to do with it?,"As with everything called an unpopular opinion, there is no way this is an unpopular opinion.",Gingers I hate,"Yeah I get that, fair enough","It was an old Pepperidge Farm commercial slogan back in the 70’s, 80s and 90s.","Apparently it isnt, I honestly thought it would backfire more, I'm seriously surprised...",Almost everything.,Thank You I never would have figured it out.

The way the show ended was not what the viewers expected, and therefore viewers were unhappy. This makes no sense to me. The moment they killed Ned, you knew you weren't in it for a happy ending, all wrapped up in a bow.","Lost is another example of people being disappointed with an ending that wasn't what they wanted, but the showrunners gave. Same with the Sopranos. Neither of those undo any of the previous several seasons, but people judge both shows on the endings and not the whole.

I had a conversation about this just this weekend, and the best example of fan bases running with changes to the expected is the Marvel and the MCU, but not \*just\* the MCU. Marvel get a pass since it's comics are famous for reinventing characters over and over, and only casual observers throw fits about it. Thor? Oh yeah...let's make him a girl! Spiderman? Let's make him a mixed race junior high schooler! Infinity wars? Let's kill EVERYBODY, and bring them back! ... So many ridiculous things, continuity wise, but fans seem to roll with it and see where it goes. Some books suck, some are awesome, but nobody stopped reading Fantastic 4 comics because the movies were so bad.

GoT as a whole was a great show, and to me the ending is generally believable in-universe, despite having some narrative flaws that can be attributed to characters doing dumb things (in-universe). Just because there wasn't some epic showdown between Jon and the Night King, or a Royal Ascension for Aegon Targaryen, no Arya/Cersei assassination, or whatever would have made people feel better, doesn't mean the show was ruined.

So if he can use all the chaos of the war to achieve his dream why would he throw that away to chop firewood in the middle of the frozen tundra?","My only guess is he’s a Maester for the King’s hand now, rather than the night watch? I don’t know.",Doesnt he become a Maester of the Citadel?,"And actually nobody, NOBODY really bothered to find out why! Lol",Yeah Jon too,...and fast-tracked him to Grand Maester-ship?,"Bran can’t pardon him though. In Season 1 when Arya joins Yoren to head north to the Wall, Yoren specifically refuses the kings command to hand Gendry over to the gold cloaks bc men of the nights watch are no longer privy to the commands of kings and queens. They are their own entity. So King Bran would have no authority to release Sam from his NW vows. Then again, there’s no purpose for the NW anymore so who gives af lol","You can't pardon the watchers tho, they specifically say that only death can end their service or something. So Jon Snow is pretty much excused but not Sam.",And also D&D r lazy but we all already know that,or the writers said fuck this and didn’t care about it,"The Maesters of the citadel are shown to be ineffective due to their own bureaucracy. Idk the exact timeline, but they were completely unaware that Jeor Mormont & Maester Aemon had died. They are also shown basically ignoring hard evidence, witness accounts and testimony in their own library made by their own maesters.

Also isn't it really just Bran's call? If the king says Sam is in charge, that's law right? I don't think the Maesters could put up a physical resistance, if they even wanted to. They seem content to sit in their tower and read their books.","Yeah, he really shouldn’t be that. He doesn’t understand how loans work.

Besides, no one gives a fuck. The normies are living their lives just trying to not die, especially after a genocidal event with winter coming. 

Bran is king and gets to make pretty much any decision he wants, including who sits on the small council. While the citadel has a tradition they also proved themselves to being somewhat incompetent from being in their ivory tower so long. 

Point being, bran can pretty much do what he wants and this isn’t such an atrocity that would warrant backlash",Yea no issue for me with Sam leaving the nights watch either. Sam is an ally to the starks and a couple of them are high ranking officials so they let him do what he wants,"That's not correct, Maester Aemon was a man of the watch and he lived and died at his post. I think this came down to the Night's Watch being redundant and irrelevant following the defeat of the walkers.",That’s not exactly how it works,"A pardon for stealing books from the citadel, not for the Watch",Literally just because he read a book or two.,Yup,"Grand Maester is not the head of the Maester order. It is merely the title of the Maester who councils the king. However, in the books, the position is chosen by the Citadel, not the king.","Well I mean, if the King decided to pardon him, even if it's ""not allowed"", who's going to do anything about it? Are the Night's Watch going to track him down themselves? Would they?",Haha yeah true that I mean i'm not gonna sit here and try to justify it when the fact is that D&D just forgot... again,"So it depends on if you take rules from the show or book, because they are different. In the show you are right, it is never clarified if the king can do that, however Maester Aemon himself in the show stated that he could have been king and was asked to be, but he himself refused.
In the books it is very clear that Kings CAN absolve people of their vows. In a Cersei chapter she devices a plan for one of the Kettlebacks (Kingsguard at this point) to go to the Wall to become a brother, kill Jon Snow, then be released from his vows and come back to Kings Landing","yeah I always assumed its' because there is no point for the Nights Watch.  

  
The night king is dead and the Wildlings are their freinds now.",Im sorry. I see D&D all over this sub and i have no idea what it means. Can someone explain.,"No the maesters choose who will be grand maester in a similar way that a pope is chosen. the Archmaesters hold a conclave and elect who will be the grand maester. The king does not get to pick who he will have as grand maester. Only the conclave can remove an Archmaester as well. Unless he is found to have committed some crime and is executed. The maesters hold an incredible amount of power. They are in charge of all the various lords, letters and control what information reaches their ears by the fact that they run the rookery. If the lord cannot read then the maester can alter the wording of what is said in the letters and notes sent to them, this influencing how the lord will react or maybe they read the notes and reseal them or burn them and say that word never reached them. They are in charge also of the health of their various charges. What if they decided to slip something to make a lady become infertile or lose a baby or cause her death. This would free up the lord for marriage since he has no heirs and since you never know what family your maester comes from might be his cousins offer comes through.",Master of brothels,"The Night's Watch is now just a Summer Camp for boys.  Vows are not taken for life, but for mere months... months full of fun, friends, and permafrost!","Agree, I guess they are saying it was reestablished, but John didn't stop at castle black, he went north probably to Tormund and Ghost, so the wildlings doesn't seem to be a treath anymore, probably because most of them died but regardless there is a giant hole in the wall and the series forgot to talk about the other monstrous things north besides the WW, so I don't think there is a use for a night's watch, and I don't think there is anything preventing them from just wandering around or outright leaving, it really doesn't make any sense...",It was reestablished I guess,"My understanding was that the NW didnt really exist anymore, but the unsullied and dothraki didnt realize it.

Banished to pacify grey worm. Everyone else knew he was going to be a free folk.,It was a lie by Bran the deceitful to take over the throne and not have the Dragon Queen’s forces destroy them....

Idk,"That's why I said by modern standards. Though I think man grown is 16 or at least that's the age of majority in the South. The North seems a bit different. Regardless, they wouldn't consider it that as I don't believe that's even a thing there.","In most ancient cultures it was less about age and more about cultural standards. For women it was typically when she had her first menstration, as that signifies that she is now able to reproduce. It's a pretty solid indicator that she's physically mature (even if not mentally). That is why you hear of so many 13-16 year old brides from back in the day. (Unfortunately, today as well). 

Men it is usually when they undergo some sort of pilgrimage or ritual, their first hunt for example. Their manhood is decided when they prove themselves. This is why Samwell Tarly was never really considered a ""man"" by his father, as he failed proving himself in the traditional manner, at least in the movies. (I have only just started the books!).","Even in modern times (at least within the last 100 years), typically girls married before they were 18. It was an unfortunate fact of life back then. My grandmothers were married at 15. It’s a different time now. Thankfully. People got married and had babies early. Back then women who weren’t married with children and babies by age 30, were considered “Old Maids”.  Having children then was more important then than it is now. They actually took value in marriage and having children. They didn’t have the modern medical advances we have now. A lot of women died during childbirth and life expectancy was not as long as it is now. Disease an epidemics were rampant.","Actually, marrying 12/13 year old girls right after their periods was NOT the norm back in time in our own world or in Westeros. It was only done if the betrothal couldn't wait and they needed that ally now. Even then, they'd often wait to try for heirs for a few years because girls that young having babies often die. 16-18 was the norm I believe among high born girls both in Westeros and out of it. Catelyn Tully was 17 I believe  when she wed Ned and Brandon was older. If it was just on her period, she would've been married to Brandon before he died. A contributing factor to Lyanna dying in child bed was likely her young age. 

It's a common myth that such young marriages were common when they weren't. Killing highborn women for an heir that could easily die with her because she's too young is horrible business at the very least.","This was true of well to do families, but not the common folk, and not true of many cultures before the medieval ages. This was especially true for those above because of the genetic issues of inbreeding.

They can throw a bunch of money in the ground and get people to dig for it and it would stimulate the economy.

The differences between how the government chooses to stimulate the economy really come down to ""do we give private individuals the major gains? or not"". A stadium investment is an example of funneling tax money to private corporations. Yes it will stimulate the economy; but so will anything else. The reason for choosing stadiums is because it overwhelmingly funnels public money to private pockets.","According to an article I just read the OKC thunder have provided over 700 million dollars to the OKC economy since their arrival. This is more than the cost of the arena. I think in large cities with a lot going on, stadiums and sports probably do not mean as much economically since people are going to be downtown doing stuff anyway.

In the past, when people were exiled to the north, they joined the Nights Watch.

There are two reasons I don’t think this would happen. One, this is a society where even the people who fought the Mad King hate Jaime. The lords of Westeros will never forgive Jon even though he did them a favor. But since the different Starks now control all of Westeros, they could just ignore their lords and let Jon come back anyway, which brings me to the second and most important point. Jon WANTS to live in the north with the freefolk.

Children who grow up being torn between two families usually end up more aggressive later in life. \n\nBelieve it or not life is more complex than “he do bad thing so he bad.” There’s a big difference between a good person who makes a severe error in judgement and an evil psychopath (like Ramsey) who commits heinous crimes regularly and feels nothing about it.'], 'exz41a3': [2, 'Yeahh i remember to prove his father that he is someone and is powerful']}","{'ey0vgsz': [3, 'Have an award.

Movies, television and society itself usually paints a picture that there are only good people and evil people. Nothing else. But the truth is that the lines can be very blurred sometimes and Martin’s writing illustrates that very well. For example: everyone thinks that the Stark’s are the “good” and “honorable” characters, but in reality the are to blame for a lot. Example: Jaime killed the mad king because he thought it was the right thing to do, but then Ned demonized him for it and gave him the name “Kingslayer” making him feel like he was unworthy of being good. If Ned could’ve just put his narcissistic notion of honor to the side to see what Jaime really did, maybe he wouldn’t have ended up trying to kill Bran and maybe he would’ve stopped sleeping with his sister. Same goes for Theon. Roberts army was  viewed as the “good guys” but why would Theon feel that way. He saw his family members get butchered by them when he was a kid and basically got kidnapped by the Starks. \n\nAre some people inherently evil and irredeemable? Absolutely. But sometimes it is more complicated than that. You’re using the most extreme example possible, but if you told me you did that then yes, I would think you were a monster.
