0,They are all gonna die from all the butterflys,[deleted],But he never wanted to be king. He was happy in the North with Ghost and the wildlings,Yara would know. She'd tell Greyworm. Then war.,"Why did Greyworm not kill him straight away? Or the dothraki for that matter. Dani litterally amped the fuck out of her whole squad, as if they wouldnt torutre him for stabbing her.", I'm glad that someone mentions this. Wtf. Just bring him back. I felt so sorry for Jon.,"Is this from that guy that does like dozens of screenshots and captions per episode? Anyone got the link to his page, I missed out this season",Fuckin exactly! What were the unsullied going to be checking up on him? Stupid.,"but jon be like ""Sorry guys, I already promised I would go...""",This is exactly what I was thinking!,Tbh Yara and the prince of Dorne would have probably insisted he would be sent away.,This is so true! Poor Jon did so much for the greater good only to be outcast yet again.,"Last episode in a nut shell:
It aint much but its honest work.",Rip grey worm i guess,Nice freefolk meme steal,"They kinda forgot about the violent, short-fused hoards of Dothrakis",But WHERE the fuck did the Dothraki go?,😭,btw did you notice Jon Snow admits guilt? No body no witness,Perhaps that's his end goal.,"exactly! Unless the Summer Islanders have the same genetic mutation that gives immunity to the butterfly plague but then again all pirates that stayed long enough on Naath died.

Greyworm then should be dead if he goes there and dead people can't avenge the death of Dany",What are these butterfly jokes are coming from ? Did I miss something ? :D,he'd never thought of that 😂,*cough cough* Robb *cough*,Plus living with the free folk is what he wanted to do the whole time,"Arya can lie. It's like her entire deal. Besides the unsullied are never going to return. And even if they do they're never going north. Even then the northerners would know ahead of time and just hide Jon or temporary send him to the wall. He would never have to even see them, neverless lie to them",Doesn't have to be king just to stay,dakingofdanorf,"I'd like to see a few thousand unsullied go to war against all of westeros. They're top tier soldiers but they don't have a keep, money or, political connection in the world.","I doubt Dorne would give a shit ""oh...no, the ...queen we didnt lose any soldiers for was killed by this guy who's not like, actually at the wall...how terrible. someone should do something...someone."" -drinks wine and does dornish shit-

Meanwhile Yara is like ""I want to call myself queen"" Bran's like ""That has never once ended well for the iron islands""",the unsilled would use against all of westeros,What happened to the Dothraki after Dany died? They weren't mentioned at all,"They won't torture him. Dany's Bloodriders will kill Jon and then suicide to ride with Dany, new Khals will rise to lead the horde. At least that's what the Dothraki do. I don't know who the current men on horse are as apparently the Bloodriders do not appear at Dany's side and are not included in any meeting that's important.","Probably cause Greyworm was smart enough to know if he killed john he and all the unsullied would never make it out of the city alive, yes they could put up a fight but with no supplies in a ruined city in a foreign country and the entire north attacking they would never last and had nowhere to run. Dorne was hella far away if they decided to help at all and Yara had like 2 boats left.","But he's happy when he realises Sansa set it up so he could go live with the wildlings and ghost all along. Living north of the wall is what he wanted instead of going to kings landing, he only went there because he had promised Dani and she held it above him. He was just sad to be saying goodbye to his fam","Greyworm wasn't the only one who wanted Jon gone. Yara was also pissed off, no word on what Dorne thinks.",Are you thinking about u/ChrysWatchesGOT?,The Ironborn and Dorne also expected punishment as they had pledged loyalty to Danny.,so true,"people from naath are so peaceful they don't fight back when they're took as a slave, though, there are butterflies on the island, poisonous butterflies that kills people when they land on them, the people of naath are immune to these butterflies, they think that the butterflies are there to protect them",No one told him. I don't think Missandei would know actually.,[deleted],"Robb： Bran，my loving bro, am I die too early?",And also reunite with good boi ghost!,Too bad Ygritte was killed by stabby traitor boi,Jon could become king beyond the wall cuz it's a theme that every part of Westeros is ruled by a Stark now,Why stay in the place where most of your family were brutally murdered when you could be hanging out with your best buds in a place you actually like?,Yeah but also that would be going back on his first decree as king.,dakingfurthanorf,How many of them can be left anyways?? They took the brunt of the night Kings army,They dont need any of this when they have the ability to respawn.,Just dont have them fight right dudes in an alley,Who does Westeros have?,"They were just walking about in KL at the end while Jon is casually strolling through. Aren't they supposed to be Danys blood riders, they should be tearing him limb from limb for killing their Khaleesi. What do they do now in KL as well, like just gonna chill in this big city thousand of miles away from the open plains they're used to.",Same thing that that happened to the quality of the writing. Vanished.,Who would they be fighting though?,"That's the thing I'm sad about. He still isn't with his family. He has to leave again. He could have stayed in Winterfell and finally settle. But no, he has to go back to the Nightwatch that isn't even needed anymore. I'm glad that he left with the wildlings. But I doubt that he ever let a person in his heart. He will stay cold and lonely.","It's weird that Dorne remained in the 6 kingdoms. I always thought they would be the first to break off and declare independence, followed by the Ironborn.",Yes thank you!,oh okay. I really appreciate that you answered me :),\*cough* \*cough* Jon killing the queen he swore himself to \*cough*,"Exactly, he'd be much happier with the wildlings",True.,No no no you see the unsullied are like gay rabbits. Leave two alive and they'll multiply with a 100 % chance that their offspring will be male.,"""Thousands"", apparently. According to Greyworm.

Though they were all outside the walls of Winterfell, on the wrong side of the trench, got overrun by zombies, and had the doors shut on them before World War Z on the walls.

I suppose... they got better?",They playing Mordhau up in this bizniz,"Yeah, the bloodriders should totally rip Jon apart. They will probably live well in Riverrun plundering Edmure's land. I don't see Edmure being able to do much about it anyway.",what was left of the north's army plus any that would side with Sansa over them.,Tormund,"TBH, there is no evidence that the Nightwatch isn't needed anymore. We know so little about the NK. Maybe there is another one out there as reserve? Maybe he respawns every 1000 years or so? There is much risk to dismiss the threat of WWs out right just because the one army attacking has fallen.","Yeah, that I agree with. Maybe the Ironborn are getting grain shipments at a reduced cost or something",no problem 😊,"Think bubonic plague but butterflies instead of rats. Also check this out!

https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Butterfly_fever",Not actually a Stark tho *cough*,"Um well ok. 3 then. But that's it, no other lies!",Episode 4 Dany has like 2000 Unsullied left... Episode 6 - 2 Million! Must have been on back order.,"Cockless reproduction...

and who said Theon can't produce heirs",and they will drink Giant's milk,True Bromance,In the books the legend of the Night king is explained at least a bit. There is only ONE night king. No other in reserve and no respawn.,What do you mean reduced cost? Are they paying gold price instead of iron price now?,They got a crazy high respawn rate.  Same with Dothraki.  Plz nerf.,Life uh finds a way.,You don't know until you try.,The night King,"In the books the Night King is a different guy. He comes around after the Others have been a thing and the wall has been built up. He was in fact a Lord Commander of the Nightswatch and make sacrifices to the Others.
If they ended up being the same guy, then there are definitely more White Walkers beyond the wall. But this guy has never met the children and is not around during the Long Night.",Yeah essentially,Pretty sure they fixed it and gave them one ship to get to Naath.,I sense an assassination attempt on Yara follow by a Kingsmoot will come really soon,I bet Meera is very upset when she hears about Bran,"Also, Hodor. In fact, I'd probably put Hodor above her on the list of people who kept Bran alive.",No place for her on the council?,So we're just going to ignore the life long sacrifice of Wylis...,They really should've brought her back at some point. House Reed had a disappointing lack of representation in this show.,[deleted],Meera the missed,He can't be the Lord of Winterfell but he can be king?,"He basically said ""the money is on the dresser""",So he becomes something more than Bran only to become King Bran... ok D&D,dammit I wanna know what happened to her,Her and Hodor,The best thing about S8 is Jon finally giving ghost the appreciation he deserves,They should have brought back Merra and left Edmure in Riverrun,"Hear, hear! Meera is the shit! Long may House Reed live!",Damn. She was hot,Did anyone else notice that the idea of democracy was laughed at and quickly dismissed? But they want to break the wheel.,"I'm actually mad that HE GAVE FUCKING BRONN TITLES, LAND AND WEALTH, BUT TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT HER.",Hold the door anyone,I'd rather he was Bran the Butchered.,So fuck Jojen and Hodor right,[deleted],Brandon,He gave her no love. He just treats everyone like a means to an end. He will be a heartless ruler.,"I don't really like ""Bran the Broken.""  Its so defeatist.

""Bran the Rebuilt"" or something like that would've been cool.",Can someone bring up the Meramp theory?,I was really looking forward to see her and her father this season...,"Yeah, the ""only"" reason...",Don’t forget Hodor!😊,Yea hodor would like to have a word for sure,And Summer should be on that list as well.,"She could be the master of whispers. 

It doesn't really matter if she'd be good at the job, Bran knows everything, anyway.",LEt mY hOrSe oN tHe cOuNcIL,She probably would have voted against him,Pshh her? Not even from a super important family... Reed? Never heard of it.,"I mean, they haven't mentioned her father dying so it would likely be Howland representing their house.",Shame Shame Shame!,"He looked in 14.000.408 futures. If he wanted to be king, he had to refuse being the lord of Winterfell",Can't blame the show writers for that one.

How are said smallfolk gonna note their votes when they mostly can't read, write, and haven't heard of any candidates who don't live in a 10 mile radius.

We didn't have a single choreographed fight sequence in the entire 8th season. 

""twists""

Bran becoming the king was the least they could have done with the character, seeing as we spent so much time with him throughout the series and he does fuck-all to be useful towards the end of the story. All the other things I can think of as ""twists"" were pretty expected, but I will hear anyone out on what surprised them enough to constitute a twist. 

&#x200B;

And the reason so many wont let it go is because of the imense amount of time and investment everyone had with this show culminated in the vast majority of the plot threads being left unresolved or handled exceptionally poorly. 

If you shut your brain off and dont think about the final season, it is fine enough on its own, but even the most basic surface-level analysis of the season will reveal just about everything involved was rushed, plot-wise. Of course the acting, editing, sound design, costumes, set design, CGI, everything but the writing was AAA quality, much of it better than what is seen in big-budget Hollywood, but the unfortuneate reality is that all of that could be the best the world has ever seen, but it cant hide bad writing. 

&#x200B;

Heres one of my biggest complaints: the NK didn't have ANY effect on the overall ending of the show. Remove the NK and everything related to him, and the final two episodes dont change.","Good lord, do you even know what ""executed"" means?  Don't reply. You're too dumb to continue talking to.",Dont like people complaining about the crap FINAL season then maybe you should get off got subs because nearly every person I know hated what they did to a pretty great show.

And if my username is the only thing that you can point out shows how immature you are.",https://youtu.be/EA7UQOYskas here is where they say it,"I wasn't shitting on you for enjoying the story, I was shitting on you for having shit reasoning in calling everyone else out who was dissapointed. There are valid points to be brought up to defend the writing on the show, but ""Theon used a bow"" isn't one of them.","Kit harrington was dissapointed with his character didn't kill the nk, thats not a knock on bad writing. Same with emilia, her saying best season ever and laughing was her not knowing how to handle with how dany turned and said she struggled with it, that doesnt mean the writing is bad. That didnt say bad writing. Being dissappinted with how the character turns out or goes isnt bad writing its being attached to a character and not liking it. 

Also if you think lucifer is real it really shows how dumb and immature you are.

Once again, none of those quotes equal bad writing but good job on twisting their words","""To each their own but you probably weren't that invested in the story if you weren't even the slightest bit disappointed.""

 So only your view is the right answer if anyone else isn't disappointed?

""There are valid points to be brought up to defend the writing on the show, but ""Theon used a bow"" isn't one of them. ""
 
Again only your view is the right answer but ""to each his own"" right?

Killing your enemies when they make a stupid decision to come to a meeting so vulnerable seems pretty reasonable to me.

She could have just killed Tyrion then.

She was ready to let everyone know that she was fucking her brother,That's a pretty good explanation,Reasonable Cersei - orders the beheading of an unarmed prisoner. Nice,The caption said American Gods,Great show!!,They also have a bunch of ballistae that are apparently capable of easily killing an animal which up until recently was seen as an equivalent to a nuke.

Maybe she shouldn't have blown up the Sept with the queen making the king kill himself...",Agreed. And yes it's Drogon who is left.,Did you not see how they killed the other dragon. They are very well prepared for drogon now.,This right here is why Jon will end up on the throne and Daenerys is going to end up dead.,"Or Varys/Tyrion whatever will come up with a plan to put the wildfire into the red keep (throwback thursday to the sept of Baelor) and Davos will smuggle someone into the city to burn everybody alive? 

Wildfire is Cersei's favourite weapon so it will make everyone else believe Cersei did it and Dany/Jon can walk into the desolate waste that is KL and claim 'the throne' which will be the only thing standing after all the wildfire because the swords are Valyrian steel and even wildfire can't kill Valyrian steel or sth?",Oh wow I should not have sorted top posts by month.,"But for that she should have killed off Tyrion because he might be one of the only people who can persuade Dany to not go the 'mad king' way? 

Cersei knows how smart Tyrion is and how good he is with words, she even let him get away multiple times even though she has vowed to kill him. 

It's that OR I have this crazy theory that Tyrion is actually Cersei's first born child or something, imagine this :') That means she can't kill him because he's one of her children as well :p","In the context they presented in GoT it's very reasonable considering she gave Dany a choice, while Dany also gave her a choice. It's more so that Dany can have more incentive to burn downthe innocent people in KL.

In my head, at that point, Dany would probably be wanting to burn KL right there and then only to be reminded that drogon will get shut down by the big ballistades?

(Remembering the witch's prediction that her ""little brother"" would kill her.)",I concur. It will be either Jamie or Tyrion.  Jamie would be better. I can't remember Tyrion ever actually *wanting* to kill her. He keeps trying to get along ...maybe he'll snap.,If anyone is gonna kill Cersei it will be Arya. After killing the Night King she's pretty much unstoppable and Cersei is still on her death wish list.,LMAO... that's what happens when you introduce prophecies. Would be an amazing change of pace if they decided to just not fulfill it.,"Na, there's more. The mountain follows her commands and he didn't let tommen leave his room (through the door ...)

So, it was her an Qyburn ... QyBURN ... Qy B U R N ! ! ! but she took part.","To be honest I don't know why Tyrion keeps saying to Cersei that her reign is over, by what the series establish on last episode it seems like they are pretty well prepared to fight a dragon, they have a balanced amount of man but Cersei is the one inside the city walls with all the defenses, the main characters are marching towards her without anything that resembles a solid plan and their army is tired and wounded, not to mention Daenerys doesn't look like she's gonna wait for Jon to arrive basically attacking with less man.

To me it seems like Dany is kinda of suicidal, but I can help but think the plot is gonna save her somehow.","Yeah they can't fly a dragon around the SAM's, they'll have to take them out with troops first.",Two dragons now first Viseryion then Raghal,"I believe so yes

Edit: Google Confirmed","Tyrion has never shown any malice towards Cersei. Not sure why everyone is talking about that. Now Arya, that's a different story.",Wouldn't that be too easy though? Are the writers so desperate to wrap things up that they would use Arya to kill off everyone?,Fewer.,Yep danys game plan is absolute shit. She should get rolled over by the looks of things,"At this point she should have just camped and surround the city. They have greater support from the lords of the seven kingdoms (or at least the vale and maybe riverrun). They could have cut KL's supplies via King's Road and force the convoys to take longer, more dangerous routes.",Totally agree with what you said. Cersei is in a pretty good position. Only the plot can defeat her now,"Oooh. That could be ... *interesting.* Problem is, she hates him right now and wants him dead, so how will he be able to get close to her? (That's been my problem with the ""Arya killing Cersei with Jaime's face"" theory as well.)","I think everyone's talking about that because the books introduced a prophecy for Cersei that she would die with the valonqar (Valerian for ""little brother"") hands around her throat. Many speculate it could be Tyrion seeing as he's the obvious little brother but, Jamie is technically the younger twin. It's annoying, prophecies always bring plot armor to a story. Would be funny if they just didn't fulfill it.

I don't think Arya will kill Cersei. Danny has green eyes too. Game of Thrones will most likely have a bittersweet ending. Will see Danny evolve from hero to villain and Arya will probably be the one to take her out. Jon will lose his love and have to rule a kingdom he never really wanted to rule. Of course that's just speculation....",What?,I'm sure Jon will roll her over when he gets the chance... probably with Dany still begging him not to tell people he's a Targaryan.,[deleted],"The golden conpany are mercenaries, therefore probably extremely expensive, if Daenerys and Jon would simply sit around and do nothing is likely that Cersei's money would run out, and it wouldn't take long, they are doing the exactly opposite of what they should do...",Ya that whole sending our boy Bronn out to kill Jamie really cramps the whole theory doesn't it,I am HOPING this becomes a plot point,"Euron would qualify as a ""little brother""",But maybe some plot magic happens,"How so? Doesn't the prophecy say HER little brother? If not, half of fucking Westeros qualifies, Samwell, even fucking Bran...","Not her little brother tho, so that still makes no sense",And also Maggie the Frog said her younger brother would be the one to kill her.

2nd- Tyrion lannister is becoming stupid since season 6 

3rd - when dany was confronting cercie in last episode. Cercie could have easily killed her , y let her live?
4rd -  extreme plot armor","To be fair, the crossbows were only able to strike a dragon down (can't remember his name) because he was harmed already and wasn't expecting it.

You could even argue that they were afraid of friendly fire. But the ballistas were downgraded from semi automatic bolt shooters to the worst arbalets possible all within one episode.

She intentionally came down at an angle most of the boats could not shoot at.  She used the weapons weakness against them.","I think all of the plot holes with the x-bows could have been fixed with a simple scene showing a conversation between Dany and *literally anyone* telling her that the crossbows always stop to aim and then shoot, so if you wait and change direction last second (which she did multiple times) you dodge the shot easily. One scene in particular she was flying low to the ground to draw all of them at her aiming down, and then she pulled up last second since the bows had no way to magically make their shot take a different trajectory",Anyone who expected a frost undead Lord to want something other than death to all living things is delusional.

This is taken from the wiki of song of ice and fire. The information was taken from GRRM's books/notes of the history of Westeros. So unless you're going to tell me that the show is a different universe from the books then, no, the writers either became lazy and didn't follow the lore or they were lazy and wanted to create some awsome special bombing effects.

Dragons don't have missile launchers they burn shit down to the ground.","I agree, I mean they needed to justify their use of CGI finances towards dragons instead of dire wolves. And I am happy that at least we got a day battle with many shots of a dragon causing havoc. 

I was kind of sad that they were killed off 3 massive dragons destroying King's Landing would be a preety cool sigil for the new House Targaryen.

I am fine with the outcome and it would have been very enjoyable as a stand alone movie but the continuity is what ticked me a bit off.",Not trying to be a stickler here and you're absolutely right about them being ballistas.

What changed from the first battle to the second that gave her the upper hand like that? From the point of view of the viewers, we only see her sulking after losing Rhaegal, not adjusting her strategy. We don't see her planning on how to deal with an army of x-bows which were just shown to be super effective. We don't see anything to tip the tides back in their favor. The audience is left to believe that, despite changing nothing about her plan and being down one more dragon, Dany has the upper hand this time? That's just sloppy writing in my opinion","seriously, jfc people get picky.","Well seeing that GRRM based his dragon lore on that of Tolkien I belive it relevant.

If you want to be upset that she got ambushed in broad daylight by an armada that she should've been able to see...that is fine.  I understand that complaint.  But *if you accept the ambush,* then the crossbows make perfect sense.  

The dragon she wasn't riding on was flying in a straight line, not bobbing and weaving. An easy target.  But once Dany realized she was under attack, she started actively dodging shots.  At that point they missed every time because those big heavy crossbows are hard to pivot on a dime.  So she got away.  

Then at King's Landing, the element of surprise was removed and she was able to  take out the crossbows methodically by not making herself an easy target.

&#x200B;

I don't understand why people expected Dany or Jon to ""win"". 

&#x200B;

G.R.R.M has routinely fucked with your expectations and what you want for characters, they never get to achieve their goals in the way you'd expect. There is a lot of rushed and bad writing in the last 2 seasons but the plots points themselves aren't D&D's.","GRRM told them the ending, that is his ending still. Jon doesn't care if he has a claim to the throne, he doesn't want the job",You summed up my sentiment exactly.,"GRRM told them the backbone of how he is going to end the books. But D&D were the ones who had to connect the dots. Besides the add a lot of stuff that the source material doesn't have. For example, Arya is not going to kill the Night King in the books, because there is not such thing as a Night King in the books (he existed but like a thousand years ago). 


So, what GRRM gave to D&D was ""Dany and Jon will get together, Dany will burn King's Landing to the ground, Jon will kill Dany"". The execution was up to D&D and they fucked it up.","He also told them about Lady Stoneheart, doesn't mean they included it. I agree some of the plot points came from GRRM but at this point we don't know which ones. I think Dany going mad is the same, but Bran, Jon, Jaime, Arya and the White Walkers plots are all going to be different.","This meme is saying being Aegon Targaryen brought nothing to the story.

It's something specified by G.R.R.M so I really don't see how D&D have changed anything to make it less relevant. 

&#x200B;

I also don't see how the execution was fucked up. I've had my issues with the show writing since Tyrion was freed by Jaime and killed his father, but people have gone full Hodor recently and just rubbish everything because they didn't get their Hollywood ending","Agreed. I also think the ending could have made sense if Jon choose it on his own. Like he kills Danny, then tells the 7 Kingdoms to go fuck themselves and heads up north. That would be good. Being sent there by the Unsullied doesn't really fit. I also expect the Throne arc will wrap up before the Others arc.","The thing with GoT is that it was not just another Hollywood show at the beggining. When they had the source material (that they adapted almost perfectly) it was something else, something really different and special. But when GRRM stopped being involved and they had to write themselves only with a few guides, they fucked it up tremendously. Plotholes everywhere, things left without explaination, shameless plot armour, deus ex machina, characters acting out of character. That's not the show people fell in love with.


Of course D&D would not write as one of the best fantasy writers of our time, but at least don't turn the show into another mediocre Hollywood show. Make something that make us say ""ok, it's not like early seasons but at least is decent"". But no, they destroyed everything GoT used to stand for.


I agree with you that hating GoT is trending nowadays, but there are reasons for that. Of course, a lot of *#TeamDany* idiots are hating it because their favourite character made something awful, but have no problems with nonsense like a lot of Arya stuff or the entire *Beyond the Wall* episode. But a lot of people see the problems the show has had since season 5.","But it wasn't a ""Hollywood"" ending. They introduced a lot more TV tropes last season than they did this one. This one was rushed but pretty much every major characters plot would have made sense if they'd spent a bit more time on each journey. That's not Hollywood, it's just lazy writing to push it out quickly. Most complaints I see getting thousands of upvotes are asking for a fairy tale ending, G.R.R.M would never give us that, and he didn't give D&D the option.",The progression of Dany was not handled well. Beyond the wall was a ridiculous plot.,I never said it was a Hollywood ending because I don't think that. But they used a lot of Hollywoodesque resources that felt cheap. Unthinkable in early seasons. The series lost its internal coherency.,"Plus he made the 8.

Bobby B ruled as Baratheon, but with the combined powers of The North (Ned), The Vale (Arryn), the Riverlands (Tully) and the West (Lannister). He united the kingdom in friendship and love.

His troops hadn't even made it to King's Landing when Jaime killed The Mad King Aerys, though of course Robert wanted him dead. When it came to the children, he didn't have a say in the murder of Rhaegar's toddler-aged daughter and infant son as that was also done before he arrived at King's Landing (when they showed up to take the city they were surprised to see Tywin Lannister already had sacked it). But when the children were laid out in the throne room Robert said nothing to condemn the murder of innocent babies, understanding they'd likely grow up to threaten his rule. This caused a rift between Robert and Ned for several years because Ned thought somebody should be held accountable. Robert sent his brother Stannis to Dragonstone to get Viserys, and newborn Daenerys, with the intent to kill them too in order to protect his claim to the throne, but Stannis just missed them before they were both taken to Essos. Robert didn't make any attempts on the Targaryen children for another thirteen years (or more like 16/17 in the show) when he heard Daenerys was wed to a Dothraki khal and might have their fighters at her disposal.","Agreed, he was too fat for his armor anyway",Good for them but as it stands rn there isnt much north to remember anything.,Half left*,Meant to say they had them in their pockets.

Lyrics

Lord Almighty,  
I feel my temperature rising  
Higher higher  
It's burning through to my soul  
Girl, girl, girl  
You gonna set me on fire  
My brain is flaming  
I don't know which way to go  
Your kisses lift me higher  
Like the sweet song of a choir  
You light my morning sky  
With burning love  
Ooh, ooh, ooh,  
I feel my temperature rising  
Help me, I'm flaming  
I must be a hundred and nine  
Burning, burning, burning  
And nothing can cool me  
I just might turn into smoke  
But I feel fine  
'Cause your kisses lift me higher  
Like a sweet song of a choir  
And you light my morning sky  
With burning love  
It's coming closer  
The flames are reaching my body  
Please won't you help me  
I feel like I'm slipping away  
It's hard to breath  
And my chest is a-heaving  
Lord have mercy,  
I'm burning a hole where I lay  
'Cause your kisses lift me higher  
Like the sweet song of a choir  
You light my morning sky  
With burning love  
With burning love  
Ah, ah, burning love  
I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love  
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love  
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love  
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love

The *Night's* King is a completely seperate character. One isnt just a different version of the other,"Yeah I know. In the show the Night King is the very first White Walker created and controls the others.

Otherwise it would contradict the show.","Hey, skilledwarman, just a quick heads-up:

If you're wondering how its hinted at think about this: who's more likely to have built the wall? Bran the builder in a single lifetime? Or the demons who control ice? Also take into account that the Night Fort has a secret door for going beyond the wall and that it was the seat of the Night's King who, likely, married and knocked up a Walker. Also we know from Crastor that it is possible to treat with the Walkers and make arrangements. Granted those arrangements involve human sacrifice, but wouldnt a secret passage only nights watchman can enter leading to secret chambers and a meeting ground beyond the wall really help with that?","Hey /u/CommonMisspellingBot, just a quick heads up:

Also, Bobby B was in a drunken stupor 90% of the time so not a big surprise he didn't have time for deep thoughts like his childrens true parentage",Dakinganondorf,"It's out of character in the sense that he doesn't care about titles, but Jon seems concerned about Dany's ability to lead now. She's shown she can be ruthless which would make her a dangerous queen. He's considering being King at least.",For what it’s worth there are at least two instances of uncle-niece marriages in the Stark family tree.,He's just a fan of incest of any kind,I agree. The fact that he repeats the joke makes him seem quite realistic and human because if you know someone for long enough you know their favourite stories and jokes.,"Pretty damn close to it, considering rhaegar died at the end of the war and Robert sent assassins after dany. So if not before then right after",To be fair. It wasnt the first thing on his mind either.,"I loved last nights episode. Top 5 in my book. But it really bothered me that both important conversations were cut off. Sansa asking about the north - Danerys should have told Sansa that she needs to wait and see if everyone is alive and that at least we will talk about semi independance but you would still be subject to me. If you don't like ot too bad. 


Then the crypts convo. Jon could have told Danerys as they were walking up the crypts I DONT WANT THE THRONE YOU HAVE IT I'LL SUPPORT YOU AS MY QUEEN but I'm just having a goddam identity crisis because I am someone who i thought i wasn't my whole life!",Maybe Sansa told him about the convo she had with Dany,Yeah did you see the crazy in her eyes when she said he's the next in line? Geez,Interesting I do not recall reading it in the song of ice and fire books but then again it's been some time. I don't recall all the facts in those crazy intricate books. I beleive you but I just want to know was this said in the other books explaining the history or actually in the original books. I may be dumb and simply have forgotten about it.,Can we call him Mr. Pervert?😂,I seem to remember reading somewhere (not the books) that Dany was smuggled out of King's Landing as an infant,"I agree one hundred percent with what you said about the conversations being stopped way ahead of time, before the protagonists or the audience could truly understand and appreciate where it was all going. Unfortunately I can really feel them rushing through the political talk due to a lack of time. The episodes should have been prolonged by at least a healthy 30 minutes just to give an adequate depiction of how important each convo between each character was.

As for Jon I don't believe he'll still be supporting Dany with all his heart if they both survive the next episode. Don't get me wrong I don't think he wants the throne but I believe he never wanted any position of power because he didn't deserve (being a bastard and all). He is a very honorable man and he has finally understood that all those positions (usually given to noblemen), he did deserve them not only due to societal rank but also due to his preceding accomplishments and good nature. I think we will see a character development in Jon, I mean after all he has been propulsed form a bastard of a noble house to the rank of lawful first pretended to the throne. This is astronomical and he needs time to change the way he thinks of himself before he starts changing how he views his position in the world.
But that is all hypothetical and irrelevant if he doesn't survive.","It’s in like, the appendices of a World of Ice and Fire, not something that was really highlighted anywhere or common knowledge even to book readers, just sort of a fun fact. But in general even in the real world Middle Ages uncle/niece or aunt/nephew wasn’t seen as that bad. Jon and Dany specifically is sort of weird because the Targaryen inbreeding makes them genetically much closer to siblings but they don’t know about genetics and the whole DNA thing so that’s not really a factor for them.",Aunt/nephew and uncle/niece is normal for Westeros. Just like marrying cousin's is totally normal,Yes I'm pretty sure it was Varys that smuggled her and her brother out,Dany was born on Dragonstone during a great storm hence her title Stormborn,"I disagree. 


Danerys: we all enjoy what we're good at 


Jon: I don't.


They're both good at ruling. Obviously they've both made mistakes but in general they have positively impacted their subjects in the time they were the ruler. Unless you were a slave master or a bolton but fuckem lol. 



Maybe one or both will die. But if neither die i see Jon telling Danerys he will abdicate for her because he already pleged himself and he won't break his vow. She recognizes how much courage and sacrifice that takes and voluntarily says that they will be married and share power. Maybe couple it with a scene of Davos Varys and Tyrion, or whichever of them survives the battle, coming to Danerys to advise her to do so to bring the North in to the fold and because they all see Jon as a good foil to the angry hateful danerys, while helping the good, loving version of danerys shine through. 



If they both survive this battle but then go in to a conflict over the throne ima be fucking pissed because that's not in Jon's character to do. He didn't want to be the LC of the nights watch but he had to. He didn't want to lead the army to take back winterfell but he had to. He didn't want to be king in the north but he had to. Now maybe he doesn't HAVE to.","Thanks, I knew about medieval history procreation shannanigans. I think they went a bit too far with ""keeping all in the family"". Although it did create a widely fun selection of inbred mf's literal mf's (in some cases). But for a world so progressive in certain regards... Screwing your cousin/uncle seems a bit out of place, but then again I think it's just that the show portrays it a tad bit more progressive than in the books.","I agree with you that it is completely out of character with Jon's normal way of thinking and as I said, he doesn't want to be king nor does he wish to break his vow to anyone, let alone to his lover /aunt. She'd be great at ruling but she does have a slight problem controlling her anger and  Jon might be the answer to that; but if he's not going to have a huge character development change after being told he's actually the spawn of two great houses as well as the first in line for the damn throne I'll be pissed. Sure it's the same guy, he won't start going off on people for no reason/killing/screwing around. He'll still remain the lovable dufous we all know and cherish; but it's impossible for him to remain fully as the John we know. I think he'll get hopefully more confident and more self-esteem /self-assurence and less wallowy because he'll finally realize that he was not only allowed legally for greatness but he was destines for it. Azor Ashai probably he doesn't believe he's that yet, but c'mon the man's come back from the dead.

It's like telling Robin that he is actually fucking Superman. I'll be insanely pissed off if there's no big leap in character development at least towards the end of the season when the dust has settled. I understand his shock and stupid, irregular/uncharacteristical actions due to being blind-sided by this news but nevertheless he needs to change.

Just because something isn't a well crafted piece of art doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed, it's exactly the same in the food industry that's why McDonald's is a multi billion dollar corporation and most gormet burger joints are small privately run buissneses.","Thing is most people have no problem with the direction, its how they executed it. 

Like Arya killing NK, fine, its a cool idea, very unexpected and different from what people thought would happen. 

Arya warping out of nowhere past a wall of undead meat and OP ice mutants... less believable and sloppy execution. 

All this without mentioning HBO offered the writers 10 eps but they shortened it down to 6 cause they wanted to be over with it and move on. 

It's really spitting in the face of the fans that invested so much in the show just because they didn't want to work on this anymore. 

But anyways, eps entertaining: yes; writing makes sense after you think about it... no.",I was expecting it to be on a much grander scale. When they said winter was coming I didn't think it was going to only last 1 night. Or only affect a very small part of the world. Didn't it start snowing in king's landing at the end of season 7? What happened to that? When the night king died was winter just over?,"Yep, all of it. I don't think it's insane to think Euron, having been blown into the blackwater, saw Jaime and chased him to the beach.

Tyrion clearly never wanted to kill Cersei, so why would he (or Varys) tell anyone about the secret pathway? Even at the very end, he risked, if not completely forfeited, his life to try and save hers by freeing Jaime.

Jaime going back to Cersei was the most real thing he could have done imo. He didn't leave her because he hates her, he left her because he wanted to join in the fight against the dead. Feelings don't die overnight, and he has said time and time again that he'd do anything for Cersei. It makes sense that him hearing from Sansa that's she's about to die gave him a rush of blood to the head and made him do anything to get back to her.

The valonqar prophecy was never in the TV show, only the books, so I'm surprised you're surprised it didn't pan out. Especially seeing as azor ahai didn't either and that's way more foreshadowed. Much like in real life, in this series prophecies are nearly always largely bullshit.

If Jaime's stab wound missed major organs (the first stab wound was in his side so that's difficult but the second was clearly in his leg) then I can suspend my disbelief enough to think his adrenalin would give him enough time to get to Cersei. Can't have been much more than 10 minutes.

The reason I brought up Peppa Pig and Blade Runner is because to me it's not that different from bringing up Transformers when talking about Game of Thrones. They're different things for different audiences.

I don't know anyone who has been deriding this show more than I have since Tywin died, but I really think this episode delivered on a lot of what I hoped to see from this series. Even if the journey there was marred with bullshit ballistas and greenseers who don't see shit, I'll take what I can get.

You know that gif where the one dude is smiling as everyone else looks on in horror? That's what I got from this is episode, first time that's happened since the mountain and the viper. Loved it.","I'm gonna do a comparison or anything but I feel like you probably don't appreciate just how profitable/successful Peppa Pig is https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/how-peppa-pig-conquered-world-4658594

Yeah I know the Mirror is ass but the fact is true, look into it if you're interested.",Makes sense after you think about it? She is a semi-magical assassin that can change her face and she is sneaking past zombies.,[deleted],you do know some of the transformers movies have made over a billion from a single movie don't you? yes Peppa pig is a phenomenon but if a movie was made it wouldn't make a billion dollars because it is purely for children unlike transformers. that was pretty much the only point I was making.,"Its also implied she sprinted past the white walkers which  they've proven to have superhuman reflexes. Like i get she's supposed to be a OP assassin at this point, and her stealth skills were proven in the library of the same ep. But common your telling me she can run so fast and silently at the same time that the white walkers wouldn't react to her? Like i feel there were many ways to make it more believable, like her hiding in the tree behind bran after sneaking into it while theon was fighting or something. But she literally went into the speed force and turned into The Flash to get past the white walkers. Its just bad writing. Like the only explanation is: ""just because magic?"", which is once again bad writing when killing off the most anticipated villain in years of investment.","Because it isn't to me. Did you think that I was saying Transformers is objectively not entertaining? I don't think you can be objective about this kind of thing. Which comes back to my Peppa Pig analogy, sure, it may be entertaining to *some,* but I don't think it holds much relevance with a GoT audience.

&#x200B;

Ah man, I was really hoping you would go into my justifications, because nobody else really has. So I can't help but feel like people are hating on this episode more because of the dumb shit that happened in previous episodes and the fact they went into it wanting/expecting to dislike it. I genuinely don't think I'd have done to many things different with the episode if I was the one picking up from where we left off in episode 4.","Yeah and I'm sure they cost almost just as much to make. We're talking profit dude, not revenue.

I don't really know just how profitable either are to be honest, I just wanted to bring up the fact Peppa Pig is it's own billion dollar business, so it's not really out of this world to talk about it in the same way.",Why are u expecting something realistic out of a fantasy show that has dragons and white walkers to begin with,[deleted],"You know what, just let people be the ignorant ass mass. Episode 4 and 3 were disgusting but 5 was brilliant. 
Most of the people are hating it just because they have to. Even before the epsiode was aired, the imdb rating was 7.3. This episode has everything of a classic GoT. Just because it didn't turn out how you wanted it to be and how you never got the grasp of actual complexity of the characters doesn't automatically make it a bad episode. I wish people understood it, but hey wait! Hating GoT is now the new trend for whatever point my little brain hasnt been spoonfed. So why not do it? Lmao.","200-400 million is what they cost. and no dude, actually we are talking franchise popularity using a movies box office to gauge the one with mass apeal.

And yes you do, you sent me an article explaining exactly what it's worth and you can do the same with transformers with a very quick Google.","Verisimilitude, we don't expect something true to our world, we expect something that feels true to the world we've been engaged with for the past seven seasons. Suspension of disbelief in stories work by taking a small handful of world-differences for granted and then having the story stay true to those changes throughout. If you start introducing too many things late in the story or break the rules you establish previously, the whole world you've built up starts to break down. For example, if a space ship showed up in a Harry Potter story, it'd break the immersion of that world.","It's called internal coherency. It has to make sense to the fictional world which has its own rules.


Would you be ok with Robb Stark killing the Night King?","Fair enough, I was never after a shouting match though. Just discussion. 

Have a good day","IMDb's estimated budgets don't include marketing costs which can at times be as high as 50% of the production cost. By the same token, profits don't account for SVOD sales, product placement, etc. So you can't really rely on either figure.

No I don't know, and nor does the person who wrote that article. Them having $1 billion in revenue doesn't really give us much of an indication to their actual profitability, but we can tell they're doing very well.

I accept that Transformers reaches a larger and more varied audience than Peppa Pig, but it's not that easy to mark the profitability or value of an entire IP until it's being publicly sold.",I'm so poor but I'd wish I could give you gold.,Bobby b,"Yeah, but did he make the 8?",Can we really say he banged Arya?

Not to mention it is the battle against eternal night. It makes sense for it to be darker.,"I watched it on a friend's TV last night (in the dark) and it was fine, but it's a night battle so...you know. I think I was more surprised about the wintery effects on their visibility in the snow to be honest. I just hadn't considered all the blustery conditions.

Did the rewatch on my TV tonight and admittedly the picture has always leaned a bit darker on that screen, so I paused it, adjusted the color settings, and enjoyed the show just as much with just as clear a picture as last night.

10/10 still think this episode was a work of art visually and audibly. I don't know how it's possible to fall more in love with a show but this season is so far an amazing capstone to an already brilliant series.",I want to upvote this a thousand times,Set the TV and source to full RGB range if possible. Great detail in the dark with perfect colour.,This guy gets it,"Having a reason for it to be dark doesn't necessarily make it being dark a good choice. If the audience's experience is made worse, it doesn't really matter what your artistic reasons for doing it were.

That said, I didn't really mind it being dark because it led to some really cool visuals.

I watched so many characters either covered with or surrounded by zombies and there were no repercussions. SPOILERS BELOW...

The deaths I can think of are Lady Mormont who ran alone to kill a giant, that was terrible on so many levels. Theon who had plot armour while the iron born were alive and then lost it when the Night King showed up. Finally, Ser Jorah who managed to survive long enough to die in Danny's arms. 

The whole episode was poorly written in my opinion. So many people inches from death yet they survived with hardly a scratch.","Exactly. Although the darkness memes are actually pretty funny, they're getting worn out already.","That might be what it attempted but it fell short against many other battles from the programme even if it had perfect lighting.

I thought there was black crush but I believe it may have been an issue with the source.",I watched it in a dark room with a properly calibrated TV and had no trouble seeing everything. I have no idea what people are complaining about.,"This is what bothers me the most about this episode.

I watched the first season then read the first book.   


I'd just gotten off of a lotr kick where I'd read all of the books and then watched all of the movies in excitement for the hobbit movies. The GOT world didn't seem that far separated and the story line was unfinished. I made two part bets with my roommates at the time that the series would finish before the books were done (series passed the books by season 5) and that Martin would die before the books were done. This last season proved why I don't want to ever watch a show as it airs and wait for the next. 8 years in the making to end like that and the books havent even been wrapped up.  its now 8 years later and he still has 2 books to write at 70 years old. It's been almost 30 years since he wrote the first book and 8 years since he put out the last book. If he puts out Winds of Winter tomorrow and follows the same timeline, he'll be 78 by the time he finishes the series.

Unlike Tyrion, Arya never met any of the Dornish nor has she been to the wall. Additionally, as far as we know, the only part of Essos she visited was Bravos. 

Also, Tyrion has gone throughout most of Westeros (From the wall to Kings landing) and he has seen much more of Essos (Slavers bay, Mereen, old Valeria, and more). Add in the fact that he first fought for house Lannister, and now fights with the Starks (Arya was always a stark, even when she claimed to be no one), Tyrion has had at least an equal journey to Arya... maybe more.","Ser Friendzone has done way more traveling, if anyone in the show is an experienced traveller it's him.","I've never used tinder, are there really profiles like that?

On the other hand, I honestly don't even remember Jon and Dany meeting. Hell, all I do remember about their relationship is they fucked on a boat and suddenly they were the love of each other's lives. They shared no memorable moment together that really made me feel like they were compatible. Really shrug-worthy in terms of a relationship.

After learning from Little Finger, one of the most subtle powers in Westeros, she showed no political subtly. She was openly hostile to the rising political power, Dany. Even though getting buddy buddy with her would make more sense and be more inline with Little Finger. Then in the end she was handed a kingdom by her brother despite how that makes no sense.",Lol.  Dumb naive character gets raped and magically becomes the smartest character in all the land. When you look at actual story arcs like Jon Arya and Dany then Sansa looks as silly as she should.,Their star wars series hasnt even started pre production so i highly doubt that,Bronn probably one too,"No shit she's hostile to her. Little Finger was an opportunist who cared about nothing but himself and his own power outside of his one blindspot. Sansa cares about the North and House Stark and it's fate. So yes, she's going to be unwelcome to a foreign invader who has never stepped foot on the continent before proclaiming herself Queen, that's of the same dynasty that raped her aunt (So she believes), Burned her grandfather alive, and choked her uncle to death trying to save him. Who her father fought a brutal war to overthrow. This is literally a single generation after the Mad Queen no shit that Sansa doesnt want another Targaryen ruler, especially one she thinks has wrapped her finger around Jon.

So, Sansa then meets Daenarys and rather quickly reads her. She's obsessed with being loved, and obsessed with the throne. It's obvious it's all she cares about.So Sansa is out to use this. Her obvious goal is northern independence. She can afford to be hostile to daenarys because of Jon, for now. But once she learns that Jon is a Targaryen she hatches a plan.

Sansa does something that's utterly worthy of little finger, Deliberately leaks information to Tyrion accurately predicting what he' do with that information and allowing the cascade effect take place, this is very likely Bran's intention as well. The chain of events causes Daenarys to unravel, just as Sansa hoped it would. Destroys King's Landing( a city Sansa despises) which would ideally leave the way for Jon to become King and her to become Queen in the North. Though the plan doesnt quite work out that way, Jon Becoming King beyond the wall, Her becoming Queen in the North, and Bran King of the 6 Kingdoms. Everything works exactly as she had hoped.",I agree. Why does everyone like Sansa now? Her character was whiny and annoying the whole show as well.,George has implied that was more studio than anything,They really fucked up bronns character though,"OK OK so you're argument is that Sansa being openly hostile was a Little Finger style move because she planned to spark a conflict between Jon and the women he loves. A conflict that would most likely involve the North getting involved in another war with the South. That would not only make her a terrible person for doing that to Jon, but also a terrible leader for starting another war after the decade of constant war the north has suffered through. Not only that there is no guarantee that the North could win that conflict. 

Also if her plan did work how would the help with an independent North. All the Northern lords support Jon. If anyone could keep the North as part of the 7 its him.

And this is a smarter plan than befriending Dany gaining her trust and then back stabbing her at the most opportune time? The exact thing we see LF do all the time.",I assumed it was a joke because the actor who played her is the one who has given fans shit for being critical of the season?,They literally made his character,You mean the one who was getting drunk and live streaming making fun of the episodes on her Instagram story?,Yes,What do you mean they made his character?,I mean the one who said that the petition was insulting.  I may very well be out of the loop.,"I mean... it is insulting. People are shutting on DnD for not really knowing how to wrap the story up and calling them incompetent. You know who else doesn't know how to wrap the story up? George fucking Martin. That's part of why the current book is almost at a decade of time in development. And that's wont even be wrapping the series up, that will be picking up right after Jon was murdered, Cersei is still held by the faith, and Dany was about to be captured by the Khals.

Also quick edit; and, having read the books, I can also tell you that alot of the best liked aspects of the series are show only. Margery is basically just a 16 year old girl in the books who hardly does anything but Cersei hates because shes pretty, Olena has hardly any ""screen time"" in the books, probably 2/3s of the Hound and Arya stuff is show only, and scenes with Varys and Little Finger one on one verbally sparring are show only, any scenes with either of those characters and no Cersei, ned, Tyrion, sansa, or Arya around is show only as well for the most part. So again, they can certainly write","But most people aren't mad about the actual places where everyone ended up, just how they got there.  Like how dragonlady went from about a 3 or 4 to mad queen in only a couple episodes, how rolly polly basically became queen out of nowhere, and how the white-walkers were wiped out in a single battle where the defenders decided to stand outside all of their fortifications with their siege weapons in front of them but managed to still have enough people alive to attack another castle two episodes later.

I know that was an obscenely long sentence and I am tired, but there is no reason for the last season to have been so rushed with so many silly decisions to get to the end when the directors were offered funding for two more seasons.  It doesn't really matter how long RR Martin takes to write the books as long as the way he gets to the end makes sense.

&#x200B;

Edit reply to your edit:  
Do I have to mention the plot armor from this season?",They did an amazing job of adapting and embellishing Martin's shit. Not so good at creating their own shit from scratch.,"I should've been more clear. 

George gave them the outline for the ending and basically said ""figure it out fuckers"". DnD has points A, B, and C thanks to the books, but still needed to get to point F on their own. And even the guy who created the whole thing has spent 8 years trying to figure out how to get from point D to point E let alone point F.","To be fair, which of those two things did they sign on to do? I doubt they thought at the time that Martin would still have bot finished the books at this point","So?  Doesn't mean that the way D&D got to F is any less disappointing.  You just said that they can write, but they made the decision to not take the time to actually put together a satisfying journey to get to F.  They acted like some of my students; did a good job with A through D, saw that class was almost over, then half-assed E to get to F even though they had a chance to take the assignment home and finish with extra time.

Remember, they were given 10 seasons with 10 (maybe 8 if I am remembering incorrectly) to finish.  They were the ones who decided to do 8 with the last two only being 6 episodes.",Lol people defending DnD after this season.,I get what you're saying but isn't Martin 2 books behind?  They had to know based on his past pace that he wasn't going to finish both of them.  They signed on anyway.  They got the ending from him up front in case anything happened to him.  They were aware this day could come.,THE KING IN THE NORTH,I dun wan it.,Why can I hear this without sound and without having seen it before?,"sorry, baby, but he already abdicated the throne",I wanna throw up,He doesn't want it,The faces are what make this really funny,"How about the Lion from the North!

I thought that the line was good.  My fiancee didnt like it either.  So killing a city of a group of people is easily justifiable, just how people justify racism and class warfare (poor vs rich, as if all poor people and all rich people are the same and defined by that group), so Danny defines the entire kings landing as userpers, people who were loyal to the userpers, which is just the same as justifying the murder of the ""masters"" as if you are rich you are a master and therfor slave owner (which we know not to be the case, as her very short term husband had proclaimed).  So to Danny, she didn't murder anyone, she was just making justice happen, thats not ""killing"" thats justice to her.

Bran and Sansa were both two of my least fav characters throughout the show.

Know a lot of people didn’t like his arc. Like yeah, he became good...but throughout the show Jaime always said he’d do anything to get back to his sister and that he loves her. Dany’s descent into madness was too quick for my liking, but I could deal with it. Tyrion’s smarts that he had suddenly disappearing the past two seasons was kinda stupid. Like he’s supposed to be smart and they made him a fool. And lastly, do I think the night king should’ve died that quickly? Nah. But I thought Arya killing him was cool. Just should’ve been more. Should’ve had at least two more seasons, rather than cramming it all in","Useful fact: a blocked nose is usually caused by the lining of your nostrils becoming irritated and swelling, so your nasal passage is narrower. And blowing your nose can sometimes irritate the passage more, making your blocked nose worse.

And we're right at that point where a new cycle should begin, according to fossil records. I also believe there's not much us as humans can do about it. 
So, to sum up your question, the only thing climate science has to do with Hitler youth is the tactic the left is using to push their Green New Deal agenda. Hell, Al Gore has been saying the world's going to end in 10 years, for more than 10 years.

While I agree it is probably going to be ineffective that a child is trying to convince a bunch of dense politicians to act but it’s not morally wrong considering the topic isn’t a topic like abortion/death penalty. It’s about accepting science. 


And you’re right the Earth does naturally go through cycles of warming and cooling. That’s not the issue. The issue is how fast it’s doing it and why. Throughout earths history the changes in CO2 happened gradually over thousands of years and was almost always the result of either massive volcano eruptions or asteroid impacts. In the last 200 years the CO2 levels almost doubled and there hasn’t been a massive asteroid impact or volcano eruptions in the scale required to change the global CO2 levels. 


And not a single scientist is saying the world would end so that’s just wrong.

EDIT: I see you’re not gonna respond anymore but I’ll leave this here for anyone who scrolls by. The reason that magic number 650,000 exists isn’t a coincidence. The earth doesn’t just change its CO2 levels unprovoked every 650,000 years. The 3rd biggest volcano in the world in Yellowstone erupts every ~640-650 thousand years releasing tons of carbon into the atmosphere. [Our current CO2 levels are higher than they’ve been in close to 1 million years.](https://www.google.com/search?q=average+co2+levels+global+thousands+of+years&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwj-mO7tgurkAhUV9qwKHXuLBvIQ2-cCegQIABAC&oq=average+co2+levels+global+thousands+of+years&gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-img.3..33i299l2.6897.11722..11857...2.0..0.219.2908.0j19j2......0....1.........30i10.Ok_Sx6YQAhI&ei=gVeKXb7UHZXsswX7lpqQDw&bih=638&biw=375&prmd=nisv&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS815US815&hl=en-US#imgrc=f_0bbO0amUQRzM) We are the ones causing this. So essentially, since the beginning of the industrial revolution, our nonstop burning of oil, releasing carbon into the atmosphere 24/7 has lead to a higher atmospheric CO2 level than the levels after a supermassive volcano eruption.","Why do you think your opinion is worth more than the vast vast majority of climate scientists who agree that climate change is being accelerated by focil fuels.

They dedicate their life to studying and researching climate. I think we should listen to them.",Lol k sure thing.,"Plea with countries that put the most CO2 into the atmosphere. I'd say that the US isn't the worst pollutant in the globe. We don't have smog warnings that'll cause lung infections. That's China and Europe. We're not still pouring tons of nuclear waste from our broken reactors into the ocean, that's Japan. We're not consuming the majority of coal, that's Australia. While there's pollutants in the US, we're not the leading cause. Neither are we 2nd or 3rd.","Bare with me here for a moment. Im going to try to take you to Mordor before dropping you off at the Shire again. Hang tight:
Im in my mid 30s. I try to observe and stay current with things that are happening. And over the past several years, maybe even a decade or more, I've grown increasingly uncomfortable when children are used as props for a cause. And I see it as a desperate attempt to make someone sympathize for something. It's happened with fast food, it's still happening with guns, it's happening with climate change, it's happening too much. And I believe it's a last ditch desperate attempt to get a point across. It's fine if you don't see it that way. But while watching major news networks, they mostly peddle the same stories because ultimately they're owned by the same people. So I look for independent studies. If it take 9 out of 10 dentists to recommend chewing Trident gum, then it should take 9 out of 10 experts to show facts for what they're claiming and independent studies up the ass to have proof. And ultimately, leave government out of it. Look at how ""efficient"" DMVs are or how effective mandatory health insurance has been... if you believe these government run subjects are effective to begin with then we are already at a disagreement. But I digress. Im failing to see how a teenage girl from Sweden would woo American politicians one way or another because even if a GND was passed, the citizens would be the only ones forced to obey it. Politicians have never really obeyed civilian laws. Sure some may but most political people are the corrupt people we all bitch about one way or another. So if John Doe can't drive a car or fly a plane or eat beef because cow farts are bad, you know damn well that Political Pat will be smashing double cheeseburgers on their private jet while on their way to tell the next citizen what not to do while they continue to do such things. 
It doesn't take a law to be passed to convince people to change. If we had 9 out of 10 scientist step up and say ""Hey do x y z instead of a b c and it'll help"" then why not do that. 
There's an episode of Rick and Morty (the Ricklantis mixup) that, in my opinion, makes a slight joke about people using kids to make others feel bad. 
Cop Rick: Why is there a crib in here?
Cop Morty: Just somethin’ they do to make you feel bad.
This is the impression I get whenever children are used as the face of any debate. They do so to make you feel bad. And after it's all said and done, it's just back to ""Mortys killing Mortys"" and nothing really changes.",You're so good at ducking responsibility.,"“Neither are we 2nd and 3rd” Wrong again.

Nuclear waste spills don’t contribute to climate change and it wasn’t intentional.


Australia’s energy grid relies more on coal than the US (80% vs 30%) but the US still burns a lot more coal in that 30% because we have a lot more people. [source ](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/energy/resources/coal-resources) 


Please for the love of god, back up your arguments with actual facts not just what you think feels like the right numbers.","I agree using children for political purposes is dumb and looks desperate but it’s not morally wrong or comparable to hitler youth when the topic at hand is climate change. They’re not using children as props to say a race is more pure than another or the country’s bloodline is superior. It’s about saving our only home. 

You’re absolutely correct the green new deal is absurd and will never pass. We should take sweeping, drastic measures to reduce emissions but the GND gets 3 major things wrong. 1) livestock accounts for 3% of emissions, much bigger beasts need to be addressed. 2) it’s anti nuclear energy even though it releases tons of energy,there’s virtually no emissions from it, and it’s clean. 3) you can’t just massively cut back on air travel, it’s too important to have fast reliable global transportation. Factories and fossil fuel energy plants should be the highest priority. 

As for your  “9 out of 10 dentists” argument [how’s 97 out of 100 scientists agree that climate change is man made?](https://www.google.com/amp/s/climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus.amp)",Im not saying climate change isn't man made. If climate change is that important then shove 97 out of 100 scientists into the media saying change your habits from this to that. Not some politicized child.,"You literally implied that our current climate patterns are inevitable because this happens every 640 thousand years and that we can’t do anything to fix it. If it’s man made we can fix it. 

And we’ve been shoving those 97 scientists in the media for years but nobody cares. They literally put a report together last month and put it on trumps desk saying here’s the problem, here’s how we know it’s because of us, here’s what we need to do. And he just says that it’s a hoax. And he’s in charge of the appointing people who control what we do about it. Rick Perry was appointed head of the department of energy and if he could fuck fossil fuels he would and he’s a climate change denier.

Trying to establish a democracy without a free press, without mass literacy, without separation of powers, without any way of guaranteeing that voters won't be intimidated into voting however their lords say they should, is doomed to fail. It wouldn't last a single election cycle. 

Not to mention that people living in feudalism have never made the giant leap to full-on democracy, there is always a transition period, because democracy only works if you instill those values into your population over generations. The best we could hope for it is that the new system of electing a king lasts a few generations and then they make it progressively better over time, assuming a war of succession could be avoided, which I doubt.","It isn't intelligent, though.

What she views as important is control. She still controlled the situation most likely. Possibly received more than gave. It was on her terms.","Euron brought her a fleet and moved an army across the Narrow Sea to earn her, though.

She was drinking wine in this episode with a smurky look on her face, right when Euron touched her belly.

The whole baby thing is just another one of ther ""plots and schemes"".",Yeah. She said so in episode 7 of last season and it was insinuated in this season as well.,Yeah tbh he has a masculine attractiveness. And I remembered just last year women fans were crushing on him.

No one had been this insolent and survived cersei's wrath. Now I get it thanks to your theory that she needed a scapegoat for her unborn kid that's why she entertained his desperation.,"Also true. Meanwhile Yara is on her way back to the Iron Islands and may just end up taking them back anyway, therefore getting rid of Euron's leverage :P",Yeah but her lack of drinking is what tipped Tyrion off last season,"If she killed him, the iron fleet would have been like ""Yeah fuck this noise, we're going back north""","Some punks like to hit it and quit it,

Tormund would rather stay and play.",I hope next episode he sees Brienne before leaving up North and sees she is upset and comforts her. She punches him playfully and they get together.

Dany: Taken care of. What's next in our agenda?",Yes it has and this season has been redeeming itself for me,"Bran was never explained, especially his powers.","Bran is dead.

He needed a body. A body that would not appear threatening to the world. 

Who better than a crippled boy. Although Brynden Rivers Targaryen has no loyalty to the Targaryen’s anymore than Bran does to the Starks, because he’s dead. His loyalty is to himself for revenge and blood. The Three Eyed Raven is a beast. Who will feast on humans. 

Brynden is a Greenseer, Skinchanger, Warger, and Sorcerer. He can cause people to go mad if he wargs into them. Or go dumb like Hodor did and will use it to his advantage to achieve his goals. Which was to be king. He’s also a carnivore. He ate Jojen to increase his Greenseeing powers. He eats humans and animals. 

Brynden Rivers Targaryen is Jon and Daenerys’ uncle. The Targaryen dynasty imploded (was starting to unravel before this) when Brynden was sent to the NW by Jon and Daenerys’ grandfather, King Aegon V Targaryen for committing murder. And It was for revenge that Brynden sent Jon/Aegon back to the NW for murdering Daenerys. Jon was a lot like his grandfather. Probably why Maester Aemon gave both Aegon’s the same speech.

Ik what ions are hahahahaha upvote",Watch. Your. Tone. Boy...,You do know filming for bloodmoon starts this year. The whole thing is set 10k years previous and is about the children of the forest.,They made Big Night Boi to fight the first men but it went wrong. Children of the forest teamed up with the NK to trap them up north. He wants the end of man because that's what he was made to do.,They explained in that very episode why they did it...,Didnt they lay out exactly why they created the night king in that same episode?,The children of the forest and there were woods were being destroyed by the first men so they created the night king to wage war against  men unfortunately waged war against them as well due to the fact he was turned into the night king against  his will,OP did you watch the series?

Move on.",And nobody really cares,The children did that to fight off the first men,"Why he was created was okay, but why did he rebel? Why after so many years the army started expanding? He could have killed loads of wildlings decades ago and marched South, so why now? What was their plan to go through the wall if daenerys didn't show up with her dragons? Was he able to take some glimpse of the future like bran so the reason he assembled the army at this time was just to wait for dany to appear? If yes, the series should have made this clear, and if he really is like bran then he should have predicted arya's attack.

For me the problem was not the lack of details on his creation, but everything after is just not explained at alk",The children of the forest created the night king to fight off the invasion of man taking over their lands.  The hate the night king has turned him against the children and he killed them as well.  This was in the show.,"Look, I have my beefs with the way the show turned out too, but guys... Leaf explained why they did it immediately after this flashback. It was to defend themselves from the invading First Men.",We waited 8 seasons to see Arya to fly above whites and stick the Night King.,XD but we'll know everything in the next series the long night,Only the true fans know,Why are you booing him he's right,The lack of information given on the nk is because there will a long night spin off,Hence holding out key plot detail so they have enough for a prequel,"I still have always wanted to see Aegon's Conquest with his sister wives, it'd be epic as fuck","Did not know! Thanks, TIL",What's the likelihood that Westeros will have the same technology level as they did in GoT?,OMG I was so wrong.,"I'm not so sure... I mean no one in this story is pure good or pure evil. Take cersei for example, she's hella cruel but she's also very protective of her children... My point is his motivations must be very mixed up rather than just ""he wants an endless night"" maybe he wants to end his creators or find a successor... I think he's a very morally gray character... Someone we'll hate and empathize with",Truth...   but we never find out what his motivations are or his endgame.  Which is sucky storytelling IMO,"The same as they lay out why Robert's Rebellion happened, and that was a lie that took us 6 seasons to learn and 7 to confirm","If you got enough out of that episode, then you're a happier viewer than I. That's a win for you.","I think you've answered why the COTF made the NK.

If you don't agree, feel free to live your life settling for what you get forever.",THIS GUY GETS IT!,"Homey, I'm witchya.",I think the meme is asking less why the COTF made the NK and is rather asking why we watched him season after season if he and his army were just going to disappear in a puff of narrative-killing smoke. But that's just my guess.,She didn't even bother to put on a fake face.,Yeah sure. Prequels always work.,"To be fair, Benioff and Weiss aren't involved in the prequel. So if it was held back it would've been an HBO decision",It would probs be a ton of action scenes with not much court intrigue stuff considering what Fire and Blood talks about the only court intrigue would occur after the whole conquest,Probably not. Unless they just phone it in the children will use stone tools and the men will likely use bronze. There are flashbacks in the books to around this time that specify bronze weapons and tools.,Based on what? He's basically an ice golem that was created through magic for a specific purpose. Why should he need more context? He's not a human with ambition and goals. He's a monster created to destroy man.,He wanted an endless night.,Eh I like the night king retaining an air of mystery. He's not supposed to be like the other temporal leaders of Westeros.,They did explain it. He was created with a purpose and he was immortal and constantly moving towards fulfilling the purpose. He didn't have motivations beyond what he was created to do.,Whose motivations?,Were you just not paying attention or something?,What kind of question is that? That could be said for any character,I see what you are saying.,Toooooo beeeeee faaaaaaaair,"I think it would make a much better HBO movie or miniseries than a full show, honestly. They do well with action-packed miniseries",There had better be a Royce running around with magic armor.,"He was being built up as a primary antagonist... If they were able to humanize him... Give him a motive that isn't so black and white, that would have made for some excellent storytelling something the show needed desperately also keep in mind that he betrayed the children of the forest which shows that he does have some sort of free will and thus can have varied and complex motivations","Exactly. It's stupid. Like putting an Orc in the Godfather. Extremely out of place. 

When even your secondary and tertiary characters have more character development than your primary antagonist (at least till se8ep3), you know you're in deep shit.",[deleted],"There's an air of mystery and then there's just an air of useless, pointless nothing.

He was the latter.","I'm guessing they mean the night kings motivations, why does he really hate humanity when he should just hate the children of the forrest (i think they're called that)",r/unexpectedletterkenny,Yea a mini series would be better than a full on series,"First, there's nothing wrong with having a flat antagonist. It made sense in the context. Also, he was almost never the prime antagonist. Maybe the biggest threat but never the biggest story focus other than a few episodes. Joffrey, cersei, even Ramsay were in the limelight a lot more often than the night king. The night king being a flat killing machine was the point. It illustrated this huge threat that was ignored for a trivial struggle over a dumb sword chair.

Edit: not sure why I'm being downvoted. The metaphor is pretty clear in the books and the show about how humanity ignores real threats like climate change, war, famine, and hunger in order to concentrate on petty politics and fortune. Really the story in that way is better left unfinished or ending in extinction, but we know old Georgie wasn't going to get away with that.",Because he was programmed by the children of the forest to,Because they bewitched him to hate all the people and he was under the spell for all these years.,"1. A flat antagonist who doesn't care about politics, or anything for that matter, makes sense if he is the final antagonist of the series. Then the story can be about ""people fighting over trivia are finally forced to come together to fight an unstoppable force"". But they are defeated way too early and anticlimactically. Otherwise what's the point of having an flat antagonist who doesn't care, if his no shits given attitude is never expoited or explored.

2. The show opens with the white walkers. At least the beginning of the show seems to think they are more important than the end of the show.

3. ""Winter is coming"" was repeated so much that it practically became a meme. And then it passed like a fart in the breeze. 

4. All those stories about winter being the most horrific thing ever that these summer born princes and princesses just cannot fathom.

5. ""They we're not the story's focus but the biggest threat"". Except they were not even that.

6. Finally, the main problem with the Night King is his existence. The white walkers as an allegory for climate change (as stated by GRRM) works in the books because they don't have a leader or a unifier as such. They are an unknown threat north of the wall that no one knows or cares much about, like climate change. But when you give it a face and a name, and a hint of a back story people will expect more. Especially when your show is known, and got famous for creating layered characters. Fucking Mountain has more character development than nk.",He shouldve had spoken dialogue with Bran.,[deleted],[deleted],To protect them that's why,Dragonglass in the heart,But they literally explain it in this same episode.,[deleted],It doesn't really need a massive explanation tbh,He's not even in the books. And they're never going to explain how all of the magic works. The children of the forest are a other magical race with magical powers. That's about all I'd expect. GRRM might get into the race more in side stories and prequels but he'd never explain the mechanics.,[deleted],No night king in the books?

The way the show ended was not what the viewers expected, and therefore viewers were unhappy. This makes no sense to me. The moment they killed Ned, you knew you weren't in it for a happy ending, all wrapped up in a bow.","Lost is another example of people being disappointed with an ending that wasn't what they wanted, but the showrunners gave. Same with the Sopranos. Neither of those undo any of the previous several seasons, but people judge both shows on the endings and not the whole.

I had a conversation about this just this weekend, and the best example of fan bases running with changes to the expected is the Marvel and the MCU, but not \*just\* the MCU. Marvel get a pass since it's comics are famous for reinventing characters over and over, and only casual observers throw fits about it. Thor? Oh yeah...let's make him a girl! Spiderman? Let's make him a mixed race junior high schooler! Infinity wars? Let's kill EVERYBODY, and bring them back! ... So many ridiculous things, continuity wise, but fans seem to roll with it and see where it goes. Some books suck, some are awesome, but nobody stopped reading Fantastic 4 comics because the movies were so bad.

GoT as a whole was a great show, and to me the ending is generally believable in-universe, despite having some narrative flaws that can be attributed to characters doing dumb things (in-universe). Just because there wasn't some epic showdown between Jon and the Night King, or a Royal Ascension for Aegon Targaryen, no Arya/Cersei assassination, or whatever would have made people feel better, doesn't mean the show was ruined. The Stones said it best: ""You can't always get what you want."" Instead you got an original telling, that had all the imperfections of a real life story, that some people think is anti-climatic.",Leaves from the vine...,"Yeah, when I recommend it to people, I feel like I have to qualify it. Yes, it's a kid's show. Yes, it's anime art style.

But it is legitimately an amazing show, for a variety of reasons, that can appeal to a broad range of audiences.","Really? That good? Damn. All I’ve got are some vague ass memories of watching it every now and then as a kid, and of it all just being kinda...kids show-like.  Tho again they *are* vague ass memories.",...the fuck?!,You're naive to think that Netflix can make good source material better.,"Crucifying 163 who just did the same to innocent children

Like stop lol","I did not want a specific ending. It could have had the exact same aftermath it did now and still be ok, the way it got there was the problem...",Falling so slow...,"I'm not saying Netflix could do it, I'm saying the original creators cn do it.",Considering Dany doesn’t even know who she crucified& the show flat out told us there were innocent people that she murdered i’m gonna say you need to stop.,I say just enjoy the ride.,Those  entire 163 were compliant in a system of slavery against other humans and even if they all didn’t agree with the crucifying they are still responsible to what happened to those children,I want to agree but the ride got a little unpleasant at the end my friend. If people can enjoy this then good for them. Let's just agree to disagree.,We literally don’t know that. In the show Hizdahr’s father was an architect and in the books they were merchants—in the books Daenerys also went on to exploit free labor (slavery) after she settled into the city. But this is all as “morally grey” as Ned beheading a NW deserter or Jon hanging the people responsible for conspiring to and carrying out his murder. Please put down the kool aid,And was she supposed to stop slavery by asking nicely? Tf all those people benefited and got rich off the slave economy,"She didn’t stop slavery—she just changed the seat of power from Ghoscari back to Valyrian (Daenerys is Valyrian, the first major slave empire in Planetos). Instead of abolishing slavery, like you claim, she made a system in which everyone lived in squalor and enslaved the former middle and upper class, then continued reinstating Meereen’s traditions one-by-one until it returned to being a Slave City with her as absolute queen.",">the dark night

Boy do I have egg on my face.,Did you miss the conversation he had with bronn about death?,"Not every person redeems themselves fully in life. If anything its realistic, and doesnt undermine his development in the series. He doesnt go to king Landing to kill people, he goes to die with his sister",Jesus people stop whining. Start becoming a spectator to the story instead of trying to control the narrative specially when you can't! For that go play Red Dead Redemption (very good story too by the way). All I see is people complaining how characters didn't follow their character development. Life is random and things just happen. I accept it. Jaime's love for Cersei was too strong for him in the end and Dany went PTSD mad. Despite being a shocker what Dany did it was not far fetched at all. You can say rushed but things in real life can go downhill fast too. Watch the show with both eyes open. Cast aside your expectations and your pretense of character development and drama know-it-allisms. Enjoy the show or not but don't go I disliked it because what happened was not supposed to happen based on x y and z. That was the reason Game of Thrones was great in the first place.,"I think the whole point of Jamie's arc was no matter what happens to you, no matter how much you change, sometimes there are some things you can't overcome. Cersi was just something Jamie couldn't overcome in the end. 

It's like Tyrion told him in episode. 2, you always knew who she was, and he did but stayed anyway.

But in context, it made sense. He told Brienne that he was hateful, just like Cersei. Well, kinslaying IS pretty hateful, especially when she is pregnant, your sister, pregnant because of you, and is also queen.  There is so much sin wrapped up in one little ball, and as far as his arc is concerned, and even his motivations for killing Aerys, this all would have made sense.

The culinary mastermind from the earlier seasons (and probably the one truly great pastry chef of the series, along with the white walkers) completely disappeared and was transformed into a chubby little bastard whose end goal was to bang Arya to get back at her for not appreciating food.

Cat: You never lost your honour.

Ned: Never.

Cat: You lied only to protect Jon.

Ned: His name is Aegon, but no one must find out. I’m trusting you, Cat. You can’t tell anyone. Not even the children. If one of them says something to the wrong person, it could mean Jon’s death. Robert would kill him if he knew he had Targaryen blood. Protect him with me, Cat. Help me keep this secret.","BUT I mean did Ned ever come out and say, hey!

Rhaegar fucked passionately. And Rhaegar died,"No, she was only 14 at the tourney and I believe 15 when she had Jon and died. So definitely statutory",r/increasinglyverbose,I think when Robb is 15 they say he’s ‘a man grown’ so is that the age of adulthood in Westeros? Or maybe it’s supposed to be 16. Idk,"That's why I said by modern standards. Though I think man grown is 16 or at least that's the age of majority in the South. The North seems a bit different. Regardless, they wouldn't consider it that as I don't believe that's even a thing there.","In most ancient cultures it was less about age and more about cultural standards. For women it was typically when she had her first menstration, as that signifies that she is now able to reproduce. It's a pretty solid indicator that she's physically mature (even if not mentally). That is why you hear of so many 13-16 year old brides from back in the day. (Unfortunately, today as well). 

Men it is usually when they undergo some sort of pilgrimage or ritual, their first hunt for example. Their manhood is decided when they prove themselves. This is why Samwell Tarly was never really considered a ""man"" by his father, as he failed proving himself in the traditional manner, at least in the movies. (I have only just started the books!).","Even in modern times (at least within the last 100 years), typically girls married before they were 18. It was an unfortunate fact of life back then. My grandmothers were married at 15. It’s a different time now. Thankfully. People got married and had babies early. Back then women who weren’t married with children and babies by age 30, were considered “Old Maids”.  Having children then was more important then than it is now. They actually took value in marriage and having children. They didn’t have the modern medical advances we have now. A lot of women died during childbirth and life expectancy was not as long as it is now. Disease an epidemics were rampant.","Actually, marrying 12/13 year old girls right after their periods was NOT the norm back in time in our own world or in Westeros. It was only done if the betrothal couldn't wait and they needed that ally now. Even then, they'd often wait to try for heirs for a few years because girls that young having babies often die. 16-18 was the norm I believe among high born girls both in Westeros and out of it. Catelyn Tully was 17 I believe  when she wed Ned and Brandon was older. If it was just on her period, she would've been married to Brandon before he died. A contributing factor to Lyanna dying in child bed was likely her young age. 

It's a common myth that such young marriages were common when they weren't. Killing highborn women for an heir that could easily die with her because she's too young is horrible business at the very least.","This was true of well to do families, but not the common folk, and not true of many cultures before the medieval ages. This was especially true for those above because of the genetic issues of inbreeding. That was not usually a problem for the regular masses and death in childbirth was very high, but still enough to overpopulate the world.","Ya, I wasn't sure of common folk but that's why I said highborn. Which Lyanna was. Though I can't speak for times before the middle ages. Though it's a fact it's stupid to marry of women so young. The risk of child birth back then was much higher just do to lack of medical knowledge, throw in young girls that don't have fully developed bodies and you get a lot more dead girls and babies",And how the director and producer didnt even talk about it as an important scene afterwards in the behind the episode,Jaime better not be dead.

(The truth is she loved him).","This was LITERALLY the only best scene from this weekend's episode.

I felt the emotion in that scene, Tyrion was treated like absolute garbage as a kid and without Jaime he would have killed himself or Cersei would have.

I also think GOT is making a nice point that no matter how terrifying literal death may seem, Cersei is more terrifying.

Cersei has no allies, which is great to see 5 of the 7 kingdom written out of the show. Most of her military is a mercenary company. So if they just waited they'd win. They split the army for no reason. Dany lost one her dragons because apparently she couldn't see a fleet of ships from the air.

But no the Ice zombies that created most of myths of the North. A threat big enough that they built 700 foot tall and 300 mile long wall and staffed it with a permanent military presence that in its heyday was comparable to military of power of any of other great house. They were pushovers. The ancient Starks should have saved their time with the wall and nights watch. They and the children should have pulled their resources and hired a faceless man to solve the problem.

No, to steal a phrase from another redditor, the real threat is ""a drunk and her horny pirate boyfriend.""",They literally spent whole of season 7 about the white walker threat,Is she though? They have been teasing white walkers since the very first scene in the pilot so they should have done something else to blend the two together instead of splitting the season bullshit between two villains.

Im convinced.,Idiot,So you think every person on rotten tomatoes can create a Shawshank redemption but isn't making one 'cause they're too busy writing reviews?

In season 7 Dany didn't want to leave dragonstone because Cersei would come and take it. Then she forgets that concern and comes back without getting it checked first. She wasn't even on her guard.

To be fair, a few seconds before Rhaegal was shot, I expected him to be shot down by someone at the castle. Because I assumed, if she was smart, some of Cersei's forces would be waiting there.  But it was weird to find that they were just hanging out in the water, where the dragons could have spotted them if they flew in from a different point. 

I guess I'm just salty he died like that. I thought it would be more strategic or he would die in battle. Not by a small chance that those huge ships weren't spotted.",What makes you think the ice in ASOIAF is the white Walkers? Could easily be something or someone else,That's why it sucked.,"I mean I agree that there were ways that they could have handled the white walkers better, but I never thought that the night king was the be all end all of the show. The show has always been about the interpersonal politics and conflict and relationships. Some dead guy showing up and trying to kill everyone certainly helped to unite a lot of people and advance the plot but in the end the show is all about who ends up on the throne.","First off I'd like to remind u that Jon Snow, realistically, wouldn't be able to get close to Night King because...... He's the night king. That was a battle. Dead bodies everywhere. And also this is game if thrones, Jon isn't some main character. There is no main character because typically the main character is someone with poor immunity without whom the show cannot continue. But GOT don't give 3 shits about their character. They kill whoever. That's y >!Arya killed the Night King and not Jon!<

Secondly,
To address everyone's grievances of the night king not being the final big bad villain 
Dude, the show is Game of THRONES, not Game of Life and Death. Plus think of it this way, The Night King is death, everyone else is life. That battle happened, life won. But now there's a bigger battle, it's not between 2 different sides of the same coin, it's within the same side. 
Danny represents the traits of humans that are willing to put aside their differences for the greater good. 
On the other hand, Cersei represents the worst traits of humanity. She couldn't put aside her want to stay at a position that society deems powerful to help fight the greater good, to save everyone. She would rather be eaten alive and brutally murdered and let humanity die than to give up some superficial position and be defeated by Daenerys. 

The Battle of Winterfell was completely different, each side was United and fought for survival. This battle is different it shows the good of humanity versus the absolute evil. The ones that would rather put aside petty differences to see the greater good versus the ones that can't. This is what the show has always built up to. If the show was called a song of ice and fire, fine I get it, even the title represents the dead versus life. But this is Game of Thrones.","I think we might get winds but I'm with you that we are never getting spring

My point was more that the defeat of the white walkers and the shift going back to the politics around the iron throne is something that I do think George always intended. I've been watching the Q&As hes done over the years and with how often he talks about ""prophecies shouldn't be taken literally"" and ""I dont want my story to end with a straight forward good vs evil battle"" and ""there are 3 major twists to the story"", it does feel like this was his goal.",He also has said before that he might require an additional book to wrap up the series besides these two,I never commented on what Ice meant in the title. I was responding about the relevance of the title game of thrones.,"What if, and I know I will be sent to the wall for this, he is writing them both and will release them at the same time?","I think the white walkers should have been resolved after the battle for the throne. It's just so anticlimactic to have literally the battle of the living against the dead, followed up by domestic politics. I think there are a number of scenarios which could have played out better for storytelling:

* The living lost Winterfell and the remaining heroes have to make another last stand after bringing the Southern forces on board
* OR, the battle for Westeros has the heroes on the throne but now struggling to defeat the Night King.
* OR everyone dies

Just about anything except what we got, really.",I would love that honestly. But I'm not getting my Hope's up for it,"> What if, and I know I will be sent to the wall for this, he is writing them both and will release them at the same time?

Then we'll get no books instead of maybe one.","Yeah but I'm pretty sure that anticlimax is kinda the point. It was never about the white walkers. The driving force of the show has always been the politics and The Great Game. The army of the dead not being the big final threat is just another subversion of standard tropes.

Sam was kind of over the Night's Watch as soon as he got some of that Wildling strange. Plus his main homie is like the top dog of the Watch again, and his main homie's brother is the king of Westeros.. So I don't think he's really in any trouble.

It would have taken all of 5 seconds to have Daenerys or Bran or Sansa relieve him of his vows, but they never did it.","Because D&D are lazy and incompetent

So if he can use all the chaos of the war to achieve his dream why would he throw that away to chop firewood in the middle of the frozen tundra?","My only guess is he’s a Maester for the King’s hand now, rather than the night watch? I don’t know.",Doesnt he become a Maester of the Citadel?,"And actually nobody, NOBODY really bothered to find out why! Lol",Yeah Jon too,...and fast-tracked him to Grand Maester-ship?,"Bran can’t pardon him though. In Season 1 when Arya joins Yoren to head north to the Wall, Yoren specifically refuses the kings command to hand Gendry over to the gold cloaks bc men of the nights watch are no longer privy to the commands of kings and queens. They are their own entity. So King Bran would have no authority to release Sam from his NW vows. Then again, there’s no purpose for the NW anymore so who gives af lol","You can't pardon the watchers tho, they specifically say that only death can end their service or something. So Jon Snow is pretty much excused but not Sam.",And also D&D r lazy but we all already know that,or the writers said fuck this and didn’t care about it,"The Maesters of the citadel are shown to be ineffective due to their own bureaucracy. Idk the exact timeline, but they were completely unaware that Jeor Mormont & Maester Aemon had died. They are also shown basically ignoring hard evidence, witness accounts and testimony in their own library made by their own maesters.

Also isn't it really just Bran's call? If the king says Sam is in charge, that's law right? I don't think the Maesters could put up a physical resistance, if they even wanted to. They seem content to sit in their tower and read their books.","Yeah, he really shouldn’t be that. He doesn’t understand how loans work. Why in seven hells didn’t they make him master of war if they wanted him on the council?","But at the same time, Jon was banished back to the Night’s watch? It’s all very confusing...","That’s totally what I assumed, no need for this....",So why is Jon in Night's Watch?,I don't see the purpose of it. The Night King is dead and the feud with the Wildings is over.,"Serious, Kings landing was burnt to rubble, new king that is all seeing and voted into power by the last remaining houses with any actual power. 

Besides, no one gives a fuck. The normies are living their lives just trying to not die, especially after a genocidal event with winter coming. 

Bran is king and gets to make pretty much any decision he wants, including who sits on the small council. While the citadel has a tradition they also proved themselves to being somewhat incompetent from being in their ivory tower so long. 

Point being, bran can pretty much do what he wants and this isn’t such an atrocity that would warrant backlash",Yea no issue for me with Sam leaving the nights watch either. Sam is an ally to the starks and a couple of them are high ranking officials so they let him do what he wants,"That's not correct, Maester Aemon was a man of the watch and he lived and died at his post. I think this came down to the Night's Watch being redundant and irrelevant following the defeat of the walkers.",That’s not exactly how it works,"A pardon for stealing books from the citadel, not for the Watch",Literally just because he read a book or two.,Yup,"Grand Maester is not the head of the Maester order. It is merely the title of the Maester who councils the king. However, in the books, the position is chosen by the Citadel, not the king.","Well I mean, if the King decided to pardon him, even if it's ""not allowed"", who's going to do anything about it? Are the Night's Watch going to track him down themselves? Would they?",Haha yeah true that I mean i'm not gonna sit here and try to justify it when the fact is that D&D just forgot... again,"So it depends on if you take rules from the show or book, because they are different. In the show you are right, it is never clarified if the king can do that, however Maester Aemon himself in the show stated that he could have been king and was asked to be, but he himself refused.
In the books it is very clear that Kings CAN absolve people of their vows. In a Cersei chapter she devices a plan for one of the Kettlebacks (Kingsguard at this point) to go to the Wall to become a brother, kill Jon Snow, then be released from his vows and come back to Kings Landing","yeah I always assumed its' because there is no point for the Nights Watch.  

  
The night king is dead and the Wildlings are their freinds now.",Im sorry. I see D&D all over this sub and i have no idea what it means. Can someone explain.,"No the maesters choose who will be grand maester in a similar way that a pope is chosen. the Archmaesters hold a conclave and elect who will be the grand maester. The king does not get to pick who he will have as grand maester. Only the conclave can remove an Archmaester as well. Unless he is found to have committed some crime and is executed. The maesters hold an incredible amount of power. They are in charge of all the various lords, letters and control what information reaches their ears by the fact that they run the rookery. If the lord cannot read then the maester can alter the wording of what is said in the letters and notes sent to them, this influencing how the lord will react or maybe they read the notes and reseal them or burn them and say that word never reached them. They are in charge also of the health of their various charges. What if they decided to slip something to make a lady become infertile or lose a baby or cause her death. This would free up the lord for marriage since he has no heirs and since you never know what family your maester comes from might be his cousins offer comes through.",Master of brothels,"The Night's Watch is now just a Summer Camp for boys.  Vows are not taken for life, but for mere months... months full of fun, friends, and permafrost!","Agree, I guess they are saying it was reestablished, but John didn't stop at castle black, he went north probably to Tormund and Ghost, so the wildlings doesn't seem to be a treath anymore, probably because most of them died but regardless there is a giant hole in the wall and the series forgot to talk about the other monstrous things north besides the WW, so I don't think there is a use for a night's watch, and I don't think there is anything preventing them from just wandering around or outright leaving, it really doesn't make any sense...",It was reestablished I guess,"My understanding was that the NW didnt really exist anymore, but the unsullied and dothraki didnt realize it. Jon got ""punished"" by being sent to serve on the wall which satisfied those who wanted him dead but really just ended up as him hanging with his boys up north.",Pure theater. Banished to pacify grey worm. Everyone else knew he was going to be a free folk.,It was a lie by Bran the deceitful to take over the throne and not have the Dragon Queen’s forces destroy them.... Bran is worse than the mad king.,"And yet, Jon still got banished there. It’s unreal how incompetent D&D are with this. Why not just wait for Greyworm to leave and then pardon Jon and make him lord of Dragonstone? It technically is his birthright after getting the shaft for the iron throne.","Getting sent to jail - break a couple of rules and they banish you from jail.

Life hack right there.",I think you missed the sarcasm in my virtual voice,"Hey, he read at least four thank you very much!",He stole books!,More like he scrubbed a toilet or two,"I know. He still would have needed a considerable time of training to become a Maester at all, which Sam never got.","Now I really want a bonus scene where Jon goes south to see Sam, Sam approaches him, and Jon just cleaves his head off.",I guess all the bitter super fans in here just kind of forgot.,"The writers of the show:

However, Bran could choose him as Grandmaester without him needing to be Archmaester as Cersei chose Qyburn.","The Maesters appear to have no physical way to stop them. They aren't the faith militant. When bran says sam in in charge, what can/could they really do to protest that? You either go along with the new powers that be, or you are ousted by force. It just seems easier to accept Sam as your boss and continue to read books in your tower like you always have.",Qyburn wasn’t,Well he’s much better at that than he is at understanding economy.,Let us not forget that Littlefinger was Master of Coin AND Brothels...,"Yeah, but why","But Danys forces are as crazy as her, so Bran was saving everyone by doing it...making him much better than the mad king","Yeah I'm beyond upset with how awful and rushed the last 2 seasons were, season 8 felt like a slap in the face after being a devout fan of the show for nearly a decade.",Jon dunnwunnit.

His punishment? joining the organization he willingly signed up for in the first place.

Still confused about why the Nights Watch still exist.  I mean, Wildlings have returned to their homeland in peace, and most likely don't want to raid and pillage villages anymore.  White Walkers and their zombies have been defeated.  A huge chunk of the wall is missing.

&#x200B;

So what exactly are they defending the 7 Kingdoms from?",😂😂,"Wildling/northerners relations would probably be pretty fucked. They’ve been enemies for years, and those feelings run deep.",They still need somewhere to send the bastards and rapists,"Grey Worm wants Jon executed for his crime. He and the North both know executing Jon will start another war. Neither side wants a war, so Grey Worm is forced to compromise. Jon has to live but he also has to be punished somehow. He also can’t just be kept in a prison for the rest of his life. The obvious way to do this is exile, and the obvious place to exile him is to the north. In the past, when people were exiled to the north, they joined the Nights Watch. They don’t think about it too hard, it’s a just way to appease Grey Worm, who is a foreigner and knows next to nothing about what the Nights Watch does. The Nights Watch no longer exists in the same capacity it used to, it’s just exile. 

Of course, once Grey Worm leaves Westeros, since the Nights Watch doesn’t actually exist, Jon could just come back right? There are two reasons I don’t think this would happen. One, this is a society where even the people who fought the Mad King hate Jaime. The lords of Westeros will never forgive Jon even though he did them a favor. But since the different Starks now control all of Westeros, they could just ignore their lords and let Jon come back anyway, which brings me to the second and most important point. Jon WANTS to live in the north with the freefolk. I don’t think I need to explain this point, if you have watched the show you should know it to be true. 

They bamboozled Grey Worm into thinking they are punishing Jon, when in reality they are giving him what he wants. The Nights Watch was traditionally a punishment, so they say that is where Jon is going to convince Grey Worm that he is being punished.","They just fought together in a war, a few times.

Cersei and Robert Baratheon have no surviving children and Renly and Stannis are dead and have no heirs. The tyrells could make a claim because of the marriage of margery but they're all dead too.

Her death was  satisfying af.,Okay there Walder Frey,To be faaaaiiirrrr......,*Lannisters,I think it was like the only scene where I really cried,Yeah thanks,Well then give it to Jared Harris.,Ah donh wunt et....Ah nevah haav,He better say that if he wins,Do you want a silver,"Don't blame the actor, he is just playing what's given to him. What does get given to him is the problem!!",Wunt**,he sucked in season 8 imo,The amount of times I say this in a week is getting out of hand.,I dun want it!!,Issa joke,et*,Issa joke about a dude who literally just got out of a rehab and mental health facility struggling with severe anxiety that's been exacerbated by negative media attention...,Unpopular opinion: I didn't give two shits about him appearing in the show,I didn’t know it was even him until people started throwing a fit. In terms of questionable scenes within the show it certainly didn’t strike me as one of the worst. I thought it was a decent scene showing the human side to the Lannister armies. Didn’t bother me at all lol.,And the fact that until that point there were only 2 songs sung in all of westeros...,"Unpopular opinion: I thought it was a nice sweet moment seeing him although it kinda broke some GOT immersion, it was still cool hearing a cute song from him in the show",I didn’t know who Ed Sheeran was until he was in Game of Thrones. Funny meme though.,Sadly everyone remembers,"I can surely understand what was the major issue: okay, he was ""Eddie"" but he wasn't portraying some different character than the person who he is. That was Ed Sheeran playing guitar in Westeros so the suspension of disbelief crumbled.

But yeah, didn't give a shit either.","I didn’t care either, but it was because I had never seen his picture or anything so I didn’t realize who it was!

All those innocent people who were just a cog in a machine that was created hundreds years ago,Why,You felt sympathy for them?,The same could be said if Dany herself,"Because it was absolutely unnecessary. She coul have just imprisoned them, and even if she had to kill them it could have been done much more humane. They were brave fighters, dying just for their integrity as they could not break an oath.

At that moment it seemed like she is slowly going the way of the Mad King.",Well objectively as a TV viewer and fan I was able to see she was making a mistake crucifing all of the slave Masters as some of them probably weren't mistreating the slaves. I mean if you watched later what's his face just asks to bury his loving father...who just happened to be a slave Master who spoke out against cruel punishment. So... I think when it comes to arguing whether dany made a mistake or not the show makes it very clear that she did.,They certainly find the best most experienced men for the job.,I guess you need a lot of coins to get the brothel experience,How to budget to get the best whore for your money,Lolol,Don't forget a jackass and a honeycomb.,Coin = poonanny...it is known,Everyone in that scene other than Tyrion was so  unqualified that it fucking annoyed me,"Pod should be Master of Coin, gets money on both sides",Davos was stanis' master of ships wasnt he?,And how did that turn out?,Fair point,BURN,Like the ships Davis was in charge of,"I know Tommen committed suicide, but it still hilarious to see his picture and then a smaller version of his picture XD",You forgot queen cersei and a brick,Lost it when I saw that Pumba image,You forgot Jaime killed Euron,It has to be olleana.

Because her line to Jaime about it was the most badass thing,"The walkers killed Hodor, the king of our hearts.",Sansa / Arya on Littlefinger,Love this,Drogo!,Aria! Without a doubt,We need the rocks for cersei,Jaime has 2 now tho,The rock,Tommen's was,Replace euron with cercei and a brick,Where is sansa and ramsi?,Needs more Brick and Cersei,The bricks had the best kill,Tommen the real Airsupport of Westeros forget about Dragons,That Tommen one got me 😂,oh boi lemme tell you sumn,"I think you are the first one to actually get all of them. All the ones before forgot  Xaro.

Also the best one is porbably a tie between Olenna and Khal Drogo. Closely followed by Tommen. (Not that I liked Tommen killing himself, but it was the most unexpected.",Doesn't get old.. just like Tommen,He looks so proud for killing himself,Also the Renly one is funny,Bricarys,"This is King Slayers Club, not a Queen Slayers Club...",He was no king,royalty is passed down by marriage,So melted gold on the head wasn't so awesome?,He was made the king of qarth right before he was killed.,"I think tommens story was quiet interesting and metaphorical. How a young kind king got manipulated by everyone for their benefit and he instead reached onto the faith ( the first thing he said, when tywin asked him what makes a good king, was faith). And how after seeing the death of his lover he ended up taking his own life cause he had enough of this cruel world.",Tywin was never a king.,He was just warden of the North I think,Except Little Finger was not a king.,He was just warden of the North,"Ah, the good old Tommen two-step","Yeah, that shadow is 100% accurate to the show XD",Equal title,"He has the same title as Balon had,who is up there.",He was king of the iron isles wasn't he?,"Yes buuut he never actually was a legit-throne-baring-king.

She is Arya Stark of Winterfell and she was going home :)) lol",What are you talking about?  That's Drax standing very still.,Damn Jacqen H'ghar is a snack,Arya never became no one because she quit training with the faceless men early.

No.,Girl is a one,No,Don’t forget about Gendry,What did he say?,"When he first meets Jon, Jon says Gendry is much leaner than his father and Gendry responses saying Jon is much shorter than his father",The Night King makes all kinds of short jokes about Jon.  He doesn’t say them out loud but keeps a journal,Shit JK Rowling gave advice to GRR Martin it seems,“One of those darned Hobbits Sauron told me about was at Hardhome today!

Also the fire leaking out of his throat probably didn’t help either.,Just don't fall off lol,It was drogon wasn't it?,Plot,Bad writers,How cool would it have been if the fire went directly towards him and he just emerged from the flames like bitch I have the blood of dragons too you cant burn me,I'm pretty sure Jon burnt his hand on a lantern in season 1.,"No, it was the ice dragon. Viserion.",Armor,"As far as i know Daenerys was the only targaryen to ever have that ability, but it would have been cool as fuck if that happened","When he got pinned down I thought that was where they were going.

The next step was going to be Jon slaying a dragon.","*Yea. I too expected that plot when it was released. Everyone feeling emotional when they see Viserion firing at him and he gets engulfed in fires, but just like how night king surprised Dany by appearing unaffected by the fire, Jon would emerge out rhetorically. And everyone around him would start doubting him of targaryen lineage.*

Instead they sacrificed Dany by using Sansa to reveal the secret to Tyrion.

*Lineage of Jon Snow with Targaryen's was quite unused in the series. They ranted about him being a Targaryen  a multitude of times before last episode, as if it had some important role in the series.*

Even Lord Varys's letters went useless in last episode. Jon simply went exile.

Just like from the start of GOT they boasted about the threat of Night King, who met hades by a single stroke in a single episode.

He came and died in a single episode. The one who was cited as the greatest threat of living world.

And the one who killed him, the assassin Arya was simply prancing around when Dany rained fire on the city.",He's thinking the meme references the finale when Drogon finds Jon standing over Dany's body. Jon did technically end up face to face with 2 very angry dragons in the final season. This meme accurately covers both scenes.,This,"Well, he stabbed one repeatedly...","True, true.","My dad started making our genealogy tree like 3-4 years ago.

We had a time in history called Partitions if Poland when Russia, Austria and Prussia divided up our territory. And we didn't exist until the end of WWI. As a country - as the nation, Poles were much or less protecting themself of the russification or germanization.","I would have to ask him but I think majority of his job was going the churches, especially the churches where was our known family members baptised, or got married or died/were born. The churches normally may have the archives where they have the info. With infos about them he had some clues about the places of birth of the people (if they came from different place). The biggest problem here was Russian and German languages (we live at the old Russian-Prussian border in the north of Masovia region). 

He was also looking in the Internet for the people with our surname, and because it is really uncommon, the chances for the people for being our far-far family was quite big. Sometimes they refused to share the infos (probably being afraid of some testament heritage blah blah) but normally they do share at least the info for closest family. Which makes the thing easier for you can try to connect the dots and find mutual ancestors.",Yeah I understood from the context I just thought it was an entertaining line.

Kings landing moved from where it originally was, it kept focusing on last hearth when we were there for less than 5 minutes etc. Plus it seemed redundant to change it in the last season.","He said also which implies this is an addition to something else.

Also of course it focused on Last Hearth and Kins Landing. We spent the entire season in Westeros they're not gonna slap on random locations are they",Last hearth was in less than five minutes of one episode yet it went back each time. It kept focusing on the wall being knocked down even though it didn’t really matter anymore,"The whole point of this season's intro was following the NK's advance, which is why we see the floor turning blue as the camera moves. He began at the wall (which was a massive deal in Westeros) and went through Last Hearth so once again, of course they're going to show it",So true,Even Ghost!,As a digital artist in the industry; I assure you the budget doesn't go to paying us. :p,I really wanted those elephants,I didn't like Daenerys in this scene. Such a bitch thing to say.,Best part of the new season is all of the new memes.,Daenerys is a bitch sometimes,Reee,I did think the dragon riding was a bit longer than necessary but still the setting was amazing with all the snowy cliffs and peaks. Had my inner nomad getting good chills.,We want Ghost! We want Ghost! 😤,I just made a Vine out of this scene 😂,Ghost! Ghost! Don’t trust Shepherd!,"Indeed. She isn't acting at all like she wants to get the North's trust. She's coming in and acting like a conquerer rather than a potential ally. How she entered Winterfell is equivalent to how the Persian Emissary entered Sparta in the beginning of 300 to talk to Leonidas. Both were a means to threaten to subjugate.

That's precisely why the North is right to not trust her fully and I never thought I'd say this 2 seasons ago but I'm on Sansa's side on this.","I mean I guess she's being honest about it, but it seems she was saying it like that to be intimidating. She didn't have to word it that way either.",As if Sansa wasn't being a cunt to her...,"Maybe, but Daenerys is the one that is coming into Sansa's home and if she want her respect she should earn it, not demand it. That doesn't only go for Sansa, but all the other people Daenerys wants to rule. Look at the unsully, she earned her respect with them.","Daenerys gave her a genuine compliment during their very first encounter, which Sansa was bitchy about for some childish reason. It goes both ways and in my opinion Sansa is being a huge B and is not even trying to have a productive relationship. Of course Daenerys needs to earn her respect but the same goes for Sansa.",Hmm 🤔 that is true.. I hadn't really thought of that. Daenerys did give her that compliment so I guess she just followed along with the cold tone. Sansa probably wants more power and I think she has a lot of pride for house Stark.. it will be interesting to see how they get along in the next episode.,Indeed,Was the coffee cup the head writer for season 8?

Okay.","The problem isn't what she did it's **why**. With the way the story was told, Dany had already won when she just abruptly decided to burn everyone indiscriminately, including children. There was seemingly no catalyst that prompted her to just drop all the years of development to say ""fuck everyone"". Yes, Dany always had rumblings of a dark side but they were consistently tempered by her resolve to break the wheel and be a better ruler. Even when she's at her lowest point in the story, it's tough to believe that she would fly into a rage without any provocation (after winning, mind you).

Mad Dany isn't the problem. It's the execution. If you have to explain why it makes sense to someone, then you're only proving why it's bad writing. When a story is told well, it shouldn't require further explanation.","Everryone who says ""This was being farshadowed ever since because she said she will lay armies to the ground and take what is hers using fire and blood,"" are some delusional fuckers. She said that regarding her enemies, not innocent people who she had wished to rule all her life. She had been freeing them from cruelty from S1 up to S7, now she wants to burn them?","Daenerys becoming the Mad Queen is an amazing turn, if D&D knew how to write.",Bruh...,Did the person who made this watch the damn show??????,Of course she did it and it was good Hail Daenerys Stormborn oh the house Targaryen. ALWAYS MY QUEEN,A promise is a promise... It's good to see she kept hers,"But when she says that one little old queen will die....

Everyone loses their minds!!",Haha,Take my downvote you attention seeking ingrate,"I had this discussion with my wife.  We're getting story shoveled down our throats. The problem isn't that Dany broke, it's that we didn't truly get to see why and a slower shift would have solved the problem. Even a couple of seasons long whittling away at her sanity would have done it instead of a couple of episodes","Yes, they rushed through the change in Dany, but there were indeed several catalysts.

The people of Westeros do not love her. Jon no longer loves her. Varys, one of her closest advisors, tried to poison her.

She was already prone to making hasty, terrible decisions. Add all of these up and you get to her snapping.

(Though, I will admit: had I been the writer of the episode, Dany would not have explicitly sought out to murder the innocent citizens of King's Landing. Instead, I would have had her seek out and kill every last soldier, while disregarding the innocents who died as a result. To kill half the people of King's Landing as collateral damage, would still be unfit for a just ruler, however it wouldn't have seemed as uncharacteristic for Dany's character as the way it was actually portrayed.)","Finally, a man of culture.","My head canon is either varys poisoned Dany to make her go crazy quickly (slow poisoning to make her death look natural, but it didnt work because she stopped eating), or bran was wispering things to her like ""betrayal"" or ""dracarys"" like he probably did for the mad king, in order for her to go over the edge.",Exactly,Thank you. It made no sense.,"Yee, she crazy. Crazy people do crazy shit like snap for seemingly nothing and go crazy:) 
She is not the hero, just accept that, stop whining, and try to enjoy a great fucking show","You didn't see her best friend beheaded, her dragons killed, her most loyal subject die defending her, and Jon turn away from her?","The seeds of her descent were definitely there but when it came time to harvest, D&D lit the damn farm on fire.

The real tragedy is that this wouldn't have been a problem with just an incredibly minor adjustment to the plot.

For example, they could have had Rhaegal be killed during the ringing of the bells (not by Euron in some impossible ambush because ""Dany kinda forgot""), which prompts the Dany to fly into a rage. Or have Dany lose her cool because Cersei orders her men to attack despite the ringing bells. Or have her snap because all the men start chanting ""hail the king of the north"" in celebration. Or rework it so that Missandei's death is what provokes her and the provokes the start of the battle.

Something other than ""Dany remembered that her family's home was taken from her so she decides to lose her shit even though the fighting is done.""",A man of culture should always appreciated,"It's not great by any means, not anymore. Shit writing will force disappointment out of people that loved this show more than anyone else.",We're friendly discussing here :) if you don't care you can also get the fuck away and enjoy your show,You mean all in 2 episodes? Yeah I saw it.,I don't disagree.,"I feel like they were in a hurry to end the series, there is no other explanation. Potentially, they could do more episodes to explain everything, instead they had to cut the Jon-Ghost scene because money (???), they made 7 series of awaiting war scene end faster than Thanos' snap, and they ruined a character because they had to pur Jon in such a situation he has to take control of the situation, partially because he chose to reject his right to the throne (while Bran can do whatever and not accept to be lord)","The fact that she consistently since season 1 has threatened to burn cities to the ground, shown little remorse when killing/burning people, even if they're innocent and now lost 2 dragons + Jorah and Missandei that counseled her to do the right thing most of the time. Losing trust in her remaining advisors, killed Varys because he betrayed her and threatened to kill Tyrion. She realized Jon don't love her in the way she wants, realized the people of Westeros don't love her and she lost a big part of her army. 

If this don't make you mad/full of hate I don't know what will.","Its not what happened, its that her ""burn cities to the ground"" has always been measured, remember she stated she didnt come to be ""queen of the ashes.""  Yes her counsel has directed her, but she has always been for the people, for justice.  This was literally, ""fuck all the people"" and while not completely unexpected as a long term, it is a major reversal of character for season 8 given she has listened to her counsel while she is learning to rule.   again, its not what happened its that were getting it shoved into 2-3 episodes where it should have been much more drawn out to give us a better view of the story.",This actually made me laugh congrats,Now the ballista she used in the previous season sounds like a good idea,/u/saloni_123,This literally made me LOL,So so so funny!!,So THAT'S why she wanted the Golden Company's elephants!!,Properly made me gigglesnort.,I smell an underrated meme,It could've worked I think😂,Never understood why they changed the name to Robin.

Apologize? Hahahahahaha..... Oh wait you're serious?,She killed every other man in his family. He loved his little brother and his brother loved him.

","I have heard, but not confirmed, that GRRM told the showrunners: ""Danny has a type"", apparently she prefers brunettes with facial hair.

Also, I realize book Daario isn't exactly brunette, but blue and purple are still dark colors.",Valar Morghulis,That is really disappointing.

I really didn't give a crap about new Dario so I was glad when he got left behind.

The threat of the White Walkers would have been taken seriously faster and while the south was warring among themselves Eddard would have made sure the wall was properly manned.",Yes but the crown would be focused on killing Danaerys as there is no threat from the others. ,White walkers would still be coming too,More importantly Jon Arryn would’ve told Kuhn Robert Baratheon that his kids weren’t his kids and Cersei would’ve been killed along with Jaime probs,"If Ned didn't go south, Stannis wouldn't have known about his claim to the throne.

Robert would have banished the Lanisters and would have given Gendry his name or name Stanis is successor? ,"Stannis would have been his successor.

In the highly unlikely event that Martin finishes the books and this happens at least it will have an explanation other than ‘Tyrion thinks it’s a good idea for some reason’.",It was Bran's own fault for running in a straight damn line.,Edit that emoji out right now or so help me gods,"He can do good things, that doesnt change that he has killed innocent children and the men who raised him, i really dont see how ppl can see him as a 'good man' , he wasnst, his character was complex yes but he wasnt a good or honorable man",I dont care about downvotes my friend,"Where we’re going, we don’t need roads",Done and btw i felt cringey seeing it too.

He was good in the start but then he broke trust killed innocent people and children for his greed.,"Not even for greed, just to prove he was someone or some stupid shit like that idek he made me so angry and now after saving some girl and dying for bran ppl have forgotten what he has done","No one forgot what he did. And no one excuses it. But he payed for his mistakes and then some. The retribution, the guilt, the physical and mental torture, and then he still came around and saved Sansa and many others. You also have to remember that Theon spent most of his childhood as a prisoner of war. The Starks ripped him away from his family as a young boy to have leverage against Balon. Children who grow up being torn between two families usually end up more aggressive later in life. 

Believe it or not life is more complex than “he do bad thing so he bad.” There’s a big difference between a good person who makes a severe error in judgement and an evil psychopath (like Ramsey) who commits heinous crimes regularly and feels nothing about it.",Yeahh i remember to prove his father that he is someone and is powerful,Have an award. Best comment I’ve read. 😊,You actually changed my opinion about theon. Maybe he wasn't that bad.,"Still not a good man IMO, yeah he went trough a lot of pain and then saved some people , and he might have had remorse , but if i rape and kill a 2 year old and the same torture would happen to me and maybe id save my brother from something later in life, would you see me as a good man ? I think way too many people look at it too positively because irs a movie but reaalistically he really isnt all that good. (Sorry for my english i hope i could explain my point well enough)",Thanks kind stranger!,Damn people on ny post get awards but not me though. *xxxtentacion songs play in my mind*,"You say bc it’s a show we’re conditioned to think that way, but I think it’s the opposite. Movies, television and society itself usually paints a picture that there are only good people and evil people. Nothing else. But the truth is that the lines can be very blurred sometimes and Martin’s writing illustrates that very well. For example: everyone thinks that the Stark’s are the “good” and “honorable” characters, but in reality the are to blame for a lot. Example: Jaime killed the mad king because he thought it was the right thing to do, but then Ned demonized him for it and gave him the name “Kingslayer” making him feel like he was unworthy of being good. If Ned could’ve just put his narcissistic notion of honor to the side to see what Jaime really did, maybe he wouldn’t have ended up trying to kill Bran and maybe he would’ve stopped sleeping with his sister. Same goes for Theon. Roberts army was  viewed as the “good guys” but why would Theon feel that way. He saw his family members get butchered by them when he was a kid and basically got kidnapped by the Starks. 

Are some people inherently evil and irredeemable? Absolutely. But sometimes it is more complicated than that. You’re using the most extreme example possible, but if you told me you did that then yes, I would think you were a monster. But if you also told me you were raped and tortured through your entire childhood I might view you as a of a victim of circumstance as well.","But nobody knew why he killed the king, so that on himself. And if i was raped in my childhood you might vieuw me as a victim, but it happened after what theon did, so u have to think what u would feel if it happened after i raped and killed a little girl, u would think i deserved it, even if i show remorse","I think you missed the point I was trying to make, but I’m just gonna go ahead and disagree with you about Theon. He’s one of my favorite characters and I stand by it.","At about the same level of detective Arya: ""I know a killer when I see one"".

**Explanations:** 

 **- Syrio Forel  - Chase the cat. This ""stupid"" lesson actually saved her few times. While she was chasing cat,** 

she learned to run and hide like when cat being chased, she learned to evade things, remember guys when she was chasing cat in first season down in Kingsland basement, she couldn't find it. Most obvious show case is when she lured Waif in dark cave. In S8E3, she was hiding and evading dead men in a library. **Game Of Faces - mostly misunderstood - here you learn to lie or catch someone that is lying and vice versa, speaking true.   One of best feats.** She used that numerous times, most obvious with Sansa. When she accused Sansa helping Cercei and Joffrey kill Ned Stark, Sansa response was genuine so she already knew Sansa is innocent.  Other very important time is when she played Game of Faces with Sansa. She knew Sansa was innocent, but she wanted to teach her. Sansa asked where she got the note. She was playing with Sansa and at the end she gave her knife - meaning, you wanted to know where did i get note from - here is dagger and connect the dotes. Very important, because most of guys think that Littlefinger doom was when he said that Arya wants to become Lady of Winterfell. No guys, Sansa alrady knew it was littlefinger, she just played Game of Faces with Littlefinger to disclose his attentions. In S8E2, when she was talking with Roberts bastard, she asked about with how many women he slept. He could not lie to her, because she knew when ever someone is lying. **BEING BLIND**: Her hearing sharpened, and to relay on things she knows not she sees. **SNEAKING**: We all remember she sneaked on Jon on same place without Jon hearing her. It is obvious ASSASIAN basic feat. Syrio Forel chasing cat game helped alot. FINAL BLOW: She used the same killing blow when she was fighting with Brienne. **BEING NO ONE - meaning you are disconnected from emotions.** If you have a mission to kill someone, you are suppose not to have feeling toward target. We all knew when she said i am no one, that she was telling truth. But that does not mean that you can not be off from time to time. We all know Jahar was proud of her when she left, and he smirked a little. So there was an emotion.","You mean when he stood alone at the tree? And she walked up. While this time she ran, jumped, screamed past xx amounts of wights and white walkers.

Dany bit her tongue the entire time Sansa was being snarky with her up until this point and, if you ask me, Sansa's attitude toward Dany is really poorly written if they're going for a ""logical and strategic"" Sansa. Literally the only strategy anyone needs to be working toward right now is defending against the White Walkers. She should take her catty-ness to the southern land holders as they need to be either marching to hold with her or sending supplies. Otherwise GG. At least Dany is there and offering help.   


Dear D&D: Please remember that your characters are aware of and are facing an impending apocalypse via an army of the dead and not attending a High School Prom.","To be honest the food planning etc. is probably all Catelyn. The Lady runs the household, and I'd be very surprised if Catelyn hadn't started teaching Sansa that stuff by the time season 1 came around.","Sansa has learned her lessons from Cersei and Baelish but there are a couple things that go with that. First, neither of them are good leaders just good manipulators. They don’t really have any wisdom to offer on actually leading people so her giant leap in intelligence the past few seasons is a little disingenuous. Second, she doesn’t see the big picture like Jon and Dany have. They’ve both seen the army of the dead, and they both know what is truly at stake. Sansa, for all of her lessons learned does not.","Daenerys burned all of the food in the loot train when she attacked the Lannisters, so no food from the reach. Just poor writing. They emphasized on Stannis not being able to feed his some 4,000 men, but I guess Daenerys gets a pass because she’s been forced as a fan favorite onto us.",They got locked up because Drogon killed a little girl. Do you even watch the show?,That's right! I don't know why but at this point Tyrion is kind of useless without any potential character development. Maybe by this scene the show runners want to foreshadow that she might become something more than Lady of Winterfell in case the White Walkers will be defeated.,I have a bad feeling about his story. Like they are setting up his down fall or something.,"They both have thrived in their own places where they were strongest. Since Tyrion left KL, he’s made some very big blunders but whilst he was there, he was THE King of Strategy and Cleverness. Sansa is back at Winterfell in her own backyard where she knows the players very well and has a very loyal following. It’s not surprising that she would be better at politics in the North.

Tyrion has always recognized Sansa’s potential. Granted, it doesn’t need to be so obvious in the dialogue between the two but Tyrion does recognize a kindred spirit in Sansa.","Yea thats really annoying. He was one of my favorite characters for the longest time and seeing him ""bested"" by Sansa Stark, especially because we've seen their interactions before when they were both married is really annoying.","Tyrion is completely out of his element.

I don’t doubt Tyrion is a genius but he needs to adapt and learn like Sansa had to.",Game of Thrones has been going downhill beginning with Tywin dying.,Tyrion's been acting so out of character ever since he became Dany's lapdog. I swear it's unbelievable how crappy his character's become. And it's probably to make Dany appear smarter.,my man needs a win or dany is going to roast him. i hope he switches to Sansa's side. It makes so much more sense for him to back her especially now that she's vouched for Jaime.,I hate her cause she’s an idiot. She says the stuff everyone already knows and because she’s useless. What’s she going to do in the war? Beg the night king not to kill her? “Please!” *Breaks down on her knees crying* Also cause she does not carry out her own sentences,No Sansa isn't throwing shade for the sake of throwing shade she is telling Dany that she is not welcome by many northerners and needs to play her part because the Starks have made a massive sacrifice by bending the knee to a foreign power hungry idiot.,"That loot train was a weekly supply run, not even close to all of the food in highgarden.","You right you right, forgot about that for a moment. That season gets a bit blurry for me sometimes. Either way they didn't need to worry about what to feed them right 🤷‍♂️","She'd be worthy of it, more than Danaerys anyway",So you hate anyone that isn’t a fighter? Poor Sam.,"It was ALL the food in the Reach. Dany says that ‘My army won’t be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach’.

As far as all but sam, jon and bran know she's Danearys Targeryen ... the rightful ruler of westeros.","Not saying that. Sam gives helpful and valuable knowledge. Tyrion is a great advisor, always thinking outside the box. Missendei also advises well and is a good character that isn’t annoying. Sansa and Bran are just annoyingly useless imo lol. Bran is literally a potato, he just sits there staring. He could be spewing out so much helpful stuff but nah. Sansa says only the stuff we already know or stuff we don’t care about",True. Dany now seems to be too full of herself. Always telling everyone to bend the knee as she's the fucking queen. Can't wait to see her face when she learns the truth about jon.,"The comment said "" she might be MORE than lady of winterfell "" which I understood as Sansa having her chance at ther Iron throne, (and she'd be more worthy of it than Danearys etc etc )","There are no rightful rulers at this point.  Like the Sam's father said, Dany has no ties to the land and in the TV show the only family members they show of hers -other than Rhaegar- are incompetent rulers.  Dany barely differs from Cersei in the fact that she claims she cares about the realm and its people but burns prisoners at the stake if they don't bend the knee.  She has only shown that she is power hungry, unintelligent, and lucky throughout the show which is why she doesn't give a shit about the ""lady of winter fell"" even though she should respect the family that has been and stayed in Westeros since the first men and has ancient ties to the North.","What helpful knowledge did Sam give that we didn’t already know? And a lot of us do care about what she says. 

Edit: I’m trying to think now, what valuable advice did Missandei give Daenerys? I didn’t watch the whole thing all the way through a second time so maybe I’m forgetting something. Also annoying isn’t the same for everyone? Lol I don’t think Sansa is annoying. Also, hasn’t Tyrion given bad advice for the past season?

Edit 2: Oh I remember, it’s thanks to Sam that we know dragon glass kills white walkers. Was there anything else I’m forgetting?",Sansa hasn't had the opportunity to rule for long but she still understands how things are.  Dany is completely ignorant and has been powerful since the first season because of dumb luck and she hasn't done anything intelligent the whole time.,"i missed that, but the starks aren't anywhere near the conversation in terms of ""heir to the throne"" or they weren't until the truth of Jon came out, and now the line of succession would only go to the starks via the death of Jon(and the acceptance by Bran the closest male heir and he doesn't seem keen on ""king""). which leaves right to rule by conquest, Sansa does not seem the type to lead a charge against Cersei for the iron throne, the North just wants primarily to keep to itself, which given that they do not recognize the sovereignty of the iron throne over their lands... that means the lord/lady of winterfell is the ""king(/queen) of the north""","> There are no rightful rulers at this point.

there is always 1 rightful heir to the throne or there are no more nobles left, that is how their system works...

>, Dany has no ties to the land

this means nothing in the court(not our modern judicial system but the royal court)

>the only family members they show of hers -other than Rhaegar- are incompetent rulers. Dany barely differs from Cersei in the fact that she claims she cares about the realm and its people but burns prisoners at the stake if they don't bend the knee. She has only shown that she is power hungry, unintelligent,and lucky throughout the show 

again irrelevant, this is not ""who could lead best"" it's ""who has the birthright"" it's a problem that has lead to many incompetent kings, but it's how the system works. furthermore ""the lady of winterfell"" has yet to show an inkling of any actual intelligence. she betrayed her father to his death, she was the pawn of pretty much every political mover in kings landing until someone framed her for the death of the king and was *unbelievably* lucky enough one of the co-conspirators had the hots for her as a proxy of her mom and got her out before she could be detained, only to be used as a political pawn yet again, to excuse the murder of her aunt. don't pretend that Sansa is in any way ""smart"" or even alive for any reason other than sheer dumb luck.

>which is why she doesn't give a shit about the ""lady of winter fell"" even though she should respect the family that has been and stayed in Westeros since the first men and has ancient ties to the North.

the north is the most disconnected from the rest of westeros, both literally(there are only a few land bridges and less man made ones connecting the north to the rest of the 7 kingdoms, thus the downfall of Robb) and figuratively(there's a reason the north is most willing to rebel against the crown, and last to bend the knee to the Targs to begin with).","Sam learned of the dragon glass first lol. That’s incredibly important knowledge. Missandei has always been close to Dany and when asked gives her opinions. Tyrion isn’t the best at battle strategy but he did advise against not killing the Tarlys. Which might’ve been the right thing to do. And he did have the idea to use Westerosi armies (the Greyjoy’s, Tyrells, and Martells) which would’ve been the right thing to do had it worked out better. He suggested meeting with Jon Snow. That was a plus. He set up the meeting with Cersei and such which was a plus (if Cersei had listened). All he can do is make suggestions to Dany, she won’t always listen. Not his fault",I see.. thank you,"After the war I'm pretty sure nobody is going to care about who has what family name. It's probably going to be more like ""hey you, you seem charismatic enough, do you want the throne?"". Even if Daenerys is still alive, from the look of it, I'm not sure most characters would want her to sit on the throne. So if they have to pick somebody to fight for and oust Daenerys out of the throne, they're going to do it.","I'm not talking about the fucking glovers or the smaller houses of the North, none of them are ever completely loyal in this show.  Im talking about the Starks that were raised by Ned Stark, who as warden of the North was the most competent ruler we've seen.  The Targaryans conquered Westeros at one point so really they don't have birthright because their birthright came with overthrowing the rulers and the last to do that was the Baratheons.  But the birthright hasn't ruled since Robert in season one so why would it change now.  Westeros is tired of birthright instilling terrible rulers the days of bullshit birthright are over.  Dany will never sit on the iron throne because even Jon is realizing she is a terrible ruler.  No one will support the mad king's daughter's claim except foreign slaves and her fanboys and her only hope at sitting on the iron throne is Jon being stupid enough to let his dick cloud his thinking and his continued fanboy devotion.  The difference between dany and Sansa is Sansa has been powerless this whole time but she's been learning how people think, how Westeros power shifts.  Dany has only had to burn her enemies.  When she can no longer do that, who knows, maybe she will follow in her father's footsteps.  Dany is hopeless, she has immense power but no understanding of how to use it properly, which is to use it as a threat, as intimidation, not to burn everyone who won't hail you as queen.  That power won't last because people will hate you, will know you are impulsive.  Dany doesn't think ahead, she doesn't judge people on what she doesn't know for sure, she judges them on their actions which are easy to make seem in ones favor.  Littlefinger would manipulate and destroy Dany.  To be a good ruler in Westeros people like Littlefinger are the greatest threat, Cersei knows that, Sansa knows that, Dany knows nothing.","You’re right, you might have missed my second edit, I forgot about the dragon glass. That’s something he discovered that we didn’t know. 

Any opinions Missandei has given that you can tell me? Not sure how she’s less boring when she’s there to repeatedly remind the audience that Daenerys freed her and also to have a romance with Greyworm (which was a waste of screen time lol, but I’m not hating Missandei/Greyworm shippers, I’m glad your dreams came true). 

Tyrion advises against killing the Tarleys, something most of the audience wished she wouldn’t do. It wasn’t some amazing advice. “His advice was good if it had worked out better” .....yeah, so maybe it wasn’t that good then? 

His suggestion to meet Jon Snow wasn’t incredible advice. It’s there to further the story along. No one was watching that think “Tyrion is a genius who gives the best advice.” 

“He set up a meeting which was great if it had worked” ................but it didn’t? Lol 

Don’t get me wrong, I like Tyrion. I just think your hate for Sansa is completely unreasonable. We’re allowed to dislike people for no real reason (I’ve actually never had any sort of attachment to Rob even though he’s much loved) but it sounds like your trying to come up with reasons for disliking her that don’t make sense.

1. You can find her boring if you like but her character has seen a lot more action, has done a bunch more, and has a million more lines than Missandei who’s just there. Her character had growth and development over the course of 7 seasons, Missandei’s and even Sam’s hasn’t (he’s half a Maester now, cool). 

2. Just because she hasn’t told us something we, the audience, don’t know doesn’t mean she’s worthless? Sam had one thing. Missandei hasn’t had any. Tyrion hasn’t had any in a damn while. Did Arya ever reveal anything to us that we didn’t know? Can’t even remember.

Edit: Also outside of our argument, I don’t think Sansa will be the first Stark to die. I actually think it’ll be Arya because she’ll be where the fighting is (unless the Night King is specifically gunning for Bran). Jon seems too important to kill until the end. I could be totally wrong though. I was sure someone important was gonna die first episode and no one did so good thing I didn’t bet money on that 😂","just a reminder that despite it not having any real power anymore the UK elite know *exactly* where they stand in line when it comes to the throne.

just cause some of us can't be bothered to care about the line of succession in a show does not mean that the show doesn't have that line, or that they don't care about it.",">  Im talking about the Starks that were raised by Ned Stark,

you mean the family that was so thoroughly destroyed by the rest of the country that they are left with a bastard to lead their family?

> The Targaryans conquered Westeros at one point so really they don't have birthright because their birthright came with overthrowing the rulers and the last to do that was the Baratheons

and with the end of the Baratheon line it goes to the next closest family(which happens to be the Targaryens)

>But the birthright hasn't ruled since Robert in season one so why would it change now

because until cersei took the crown herself, there was a legitimate argument that the kids had the birthright, there was a conspiracy of illegitimate birth, but the only people who supported that conspiracy looked to be power mongers, one even had the audacity to go into the court with their personal army and try to use force to get the grieving queen to step down. the next died by hand of his ""royal"" guard, the next died by the hands of that same guard. so when joffrey died it went to tommen, when tommen landed in kings landing the line of the baratheons died, it goes up the family tree looking for legitimate heirs and while no one really knows it yet, that goes to the family that created the baratheon offshoot: the Targaryens as they now have a male heir.

>Westeros is tired of birthright instilling terrible rulers the days of bullshit birthright are over.

okay, westerosi peasant, i'm so glad you found access to the internet to give us this information that we would be sorely lacking in both the show and the books, i'm so glad as we'd have to go to some fanfic site to glean that info, and on those the nights truly are long and full of terrors.

> Dany will never sit on the iron throne because even Jon is realizing she is a terrible ruler. No one will support the mad king's daughter's claim except foreign slaves and her fanboys and her only hope at sitting on the iron throne is Jon being stupid enough to let his dick cloud his thinking and his continued fanboy devotion.

you are really personalizing the show to yourself aren't you? Jon doesn't care about the throne, but he does understand the rule of law, which technically gives him the right to rule, but he doesn't want it, which would put bran technically in line as he's the closest male heir, but Bran isn't much for stark birthrights anymore, which means it goes to karstark no? i'm not sure how many of them are still living but they made a point of noting some of both of the families still live.

>The difference between dany and Sansa is Sansa has been ~~powerless this whole time but she's been learning how people think,~~ how Westeros power shifts.

she is a pawn in everyone else's schemes while Danny is a queen, a khaleesi, breaker of chains, mother of dragons... one of these people has made moves one of these people is made to move.

>Dany has only had to burn her enemies. 

yes, dragons are a definite claim to the right to rule, historically in fact, had the Targs not had dragons in the first place, they wouldn't have conquered the north, no clue how they'd fair against the rest.

>When she can no longer do that, who knows, maybe she will follow in her father's footsteps.

are you assuming the fate of her dragons? maybe she will follow in those footsteps, we don't know, she seems adamant to not do that, and thus far has only used it to inspire loyalty in people who would otherwise ***kill her.*** as opposed to the mad king that did it for sport.

> Dany is hopeless, she has immense power but no understanding of how to use it properly, which is to use it as a threat, as intimidation, not to burn everyone who won't hail you as queen

what good is the threat of violence if people who have been threatened by it continue to not submit. you either let them be, and you are shown as weak and unwilling to follow through with your acts(see the lannistars before Tywinn) or you use the force that was explained would be the end result of such continued rebellion.

>That power won't last because people will hate you, will know you are impulsive.

they were given ample warning, they understood the consequences of their actions and they decided to not be loyal to the conquering force, which lead to the consequences, that's not impulsive.

>Dany doesn't think ahead, she doesn't judge people on what she doesn't know for sure, 

yes and? anyone who judged people on stuff they didn't know would be absolutely horrible.

>she judges them on their actions which are easy to make seem in ones favor.

so to get this straight, she only uses the last resort after people have acted in complete insubordination even after being warned of the consequences? and this is a *bad* thing? lol k

>Littlefinger would manipulate and destroy Dany. 

maybe? he's dead so that doesn't matter now does it? 

>To be a good ruler in Westeros people like Littlefinger are the greatest threat, Cersei knows that, Sansa knows that, Dany knows nothing.

are you saying Dany doesn't understand betrayal and rebellion? cause she seems to have dealt with a lot of it in her time in meereen...","Missandei hasn’t given any in a while but when they were in the Slavers Bay she told Dany and Tyrion how the slavers worked and what they did and such or would do. Pretty helpful advice. Not for us, but helpful for Dany so she could decide how to act. Again, Tyrion can only give advice. His advice has been good, just not listened to by Dany or something happens that cannot be planned for. Although meeting with Jon was to further the plot, it’s still advice bro 😂 it’s still advice and it led to a strong alliance. How can you argue that? And true, Arya hasn’t done much other than kill all the people we hate most. That’s why I like Arya as a character. She’s badass. Grey Worm, The Hound, Bronn, etc. Those type of characters are simply fighters. Different class of characters and they’re either badass and fun to watch fight and don’t say anything that annoys me, or they’re funny and have bonds with the main characters. No, maybe I shouldn’t hate Sansa. Something about her I’ve never liked from season 1 though and so I was simply stating my much disliked opinion apparently lol. To me she’s just annoying and complains to everyone about everything and expects the world to work for her. Ex. Joffrey...she expected to go south and marry him. Even after Ned decided nah, we’re leaving she put up a fuss. She expected Joffrey to let her father live. Didn’t happen. So she cried. She is a bitch to Shae at a time when Shae was still a loved character (ex being “I shouldn’t have to tell you what to do, you should just do it”) yeah, I know she was going through a lot and her character was young, but still, Arya has been through worse without being a b****. Goes to Littlefinger and expects everything to go well, doesn’t and she breaks down crying to her Aunt when her aunt started going insane. Twice I believe. Lies for littlefinger, cool whatever. Wish she hadn’t but she did. Ends up with Ramsey. I’ll excuse her for all that stuff, Ramsey sucked. Meets with Jon. “But we don’t have the numbers!” I don’t think you need to tell Jon that. And she should’ve told Jon about Littlefingers army. Back in Winterfell she constantly undermines Jons authority because in reality she wants to be in charge. Even if she doesn’t say it, she does. Gets salty cause Jon brings Dany back and asks what dragons eat. As I said, maybe my dislike of her is unreasonable but everyone has a dislike for some character. I know several people that think Arya is annoying, idk bro",Pretty sure the Night King is gunning for Jon Snow because he's the child of a Stark who betrayed the North for a Targaryan.  I believe the North had some sort of agreement with the walkers and the Targaryans are on the other end of the spectrum from the walkers.  The walkers are ice the Targaryans are fire.,"Ironically enough I'm sort of a ""royalty nerd"" and is super interested in Targaryen history (and various royal family in real life), but at the same time I think that the final winner of the game will be somebody who simply will take the throne rather than ""inherit"" it. A bit like Aegon and Cersei. They weren't supposed to be on the throne but they simply forged/took it.

And since their teasing for season 8 was basically ""see how good every character of our show looks on the iron throne!"" and ""who will win the throne?"" I really think that everybody's got a shot at winning the game in the end. Well, surely not Missandei or Grey Worm for example, but I don't think the King/Queen at the end has to be somebody with ""royal blood"".",We’ll see.  Personally I think Dany is a stupid character that would make a terrible ruler.  Dang doesn’t understand betrayal.  She doesn’t understand people whether they are highborn or lowborn.  She doesn’t know how to play the game.  She only knows how to crush her enemies.  The problem is half the time she can’t tell who are her friends and who are her enemies.   She would’ve died long ago if men didn’t fall in love with her and if she didn’t have dragon blood,We’ll see!,it's the sweetest thing there is.,Does it matter?,The first time I’ve ever upvoted at 69: today extracts a heavy toll,Ser boyfriend bring me his head,Reported,... NOH....,Why?,Explain,The thing is the night king doesn't give a shit about jon. He had a chance to fight him and just raised some dead people and left. Jon is of no importance to him. He doesn't care about anyone but bran. Even if jon were to make it to him he would have just sent his dead at him. Ir the other white walkers. He would have just gotten ganged up on and died,"It is not about Jon vs Arya, or who is better. It is about Jon's only mission, from the beginning is to stop the army of the dead, not just making allies and warn everybody.  
On the other hand, Arya trained to revenge her family and assassinate Cersei.

That said, I am (partly) fine that Arya delivered the fatal blow, I just feel this cheap without even a short duel, and felt Jon's role in the fight was not a game-changer.",6 years... NK has been training for 1000 years for this fight,"This was a surprisingly easy pill to swallow, actually.",Jon took back Winterfell where the last stand would occur. Also Arya returned for him when she heard he won the Battle of the Bastards. Also convinced Jon yelled at Viserion as a distraction because he saw Arya running. All that was his purpose and the reason he was brought back.,"Arya was always meant to kill the night king. From season 1 training with syrio, and the ""what do we say to the god off death"" thing. I expected a bit more of a fight, but every ""faceless man"" kill has been quick. This should not have been unexpected. 

Though this crunching of the story is probably why GRRM wanted at least a few more seasons.","It's not really about Arya killing the night king for me. It's the fact that there's still 3 more episodes left and this was slated as the ultimate battle. The Night King has much more power as a character to me than cersei. A battle against magic and the white walkers feels more weight and stakes than a normal battle with the golden company. The living vs the dead is way more powerful than all major characters vs. cersei.

&#x200B;

The whole story is about the song of ice and fire, and I thought there would be a lot more symbolism and exploration before it was all said and done. We barely know the Night King and what his motives were. Jon and Dany having such a small encounter when they are ""fire and ice"" feels out of place. So many times major characters were miraculously saved out of nowhere...it was overused. More needed to be at stake, more meaningful deaths during the battle with the white walkers. I get that more characters are slated to die vs. Cersei, but this should have been the battle where some major characters meet their end.

&#x200B;

The final episodes being about politics with a fairly normal battle (not going to be as grand as this one) makes me way less hyped. This TV show is amazing, probably my favorite of all time. And it's crazy to think they could have gone beyond that. Having watched  the after scene with Dan and Dave it looks like these guys have started to overthink things.","The thing is that the Night King is purely supernatural he's a force of nature the guy shot a full grown dragon from like a mile with no real difficulty, he summons storms to aid him , he can raise the deads... How many people in GOT can top that? But idk I'm having a hard time accepting the Night King got killed by Arya.","I don't think (most of) the negativity is about her being the one to kill him, mate. Its about the execution of the episode itself.","Jon had been focused on the NK for his entire adult life, he fits into the lore, the prophecy and the history of this world ... Arya just learned who tf the NK is, doesn't fit anything. It has nothing to do with Arya vs. Jon. It has to do with storytelling over fan service.","Weeeeellllllll... Did Arya really train for 6 seasons? And her time with the faceless men she mostly got beaten up by the waif everyday... I don't see how she suddenly became a master assassin... Now I'm not saying she shouldn't have killed the night king, with her level of skills, maybe she was the only one who could, but I am talking about how and when she could get those skills",And the Night King trained for thousand of years so there's no reason why he shouldn't beat a psycho kid who thinks she can fly.,"""Arya would probably easily beat Jon in a fight""? What? Cmon..

Her only true knowledge of swordfighting comes from being tutored by Syrio for a few months when she was just a kid, that barely counts as anything. She trained in the House of Black and White the for like one year, most of which was stealth training, perception, acrobatics and precision. Later on, she barely had any real-world fighting experience, and if I remember correctly, never fought against an opponent who was actually  aware that she is a fighter and not just some random peasant girl (except the waif). 

Jon, on the other hand, had years of sword training even before the events of the first season were depicted. Then, he had years of sword drills in the Night watch, and most importantly, hands-on experience in countless bloody battles, in which he slayed scores of foes.

Jon is a much better and more experienced swordsman than Arya. He is also stronger and can both deal and receive way more damage, as well as weild more dangerous (reach & damage) weapons and wear heavy armor. 

Arya is a master assassin, surely I would bet on her if they had to seek out and kill each other in a dark dungeon, but if the two had a duel in the ring or in the open field, he would have obliterated her in seconds.

Edit: Think of MMA - flyweight female GOAT ( though again, Arya is very dangerous, but not in a duel!) against a decent male middle-weight. It's not even a fair fight.","I see what you mean....but im so happy they didnt go with the same old BS fight scene where hero gets beat around for a few minutes then miraculously finds the strength to beat a far superior opponent. I loved that John was 100% a distraction for the audience, we all forgot about arya running out of that room. I thought it was actually pretty great and most people seem upset it didnt follow a traditional fight sequence...but thats the core of what GoT is, non traditional.

Edit:oh shit its my cake day!!!","Well he brought the biggest army the north has ever seen and contributed to making the night king's army an even bigger army, and managed to get another dragon dead in the process... Yeah his contribution was amazing in this season so far","Jon did reunited a lot of people to fight the dead, I think he was a game changer.",It's cause Arya is Azor Ahai. Everything she has done and every person along the way has been the lord of light leading her to to moment to kill the Night King. Beric Dondarrion's entire reason for coming back like he did was so area could be their in that moment. Jon is kinda just lame.,"Not to mention the assassination itself was a cheap shot with no real build-up. I would have been fine with Arya killing the Night King if it had actually been done \*well\* as a scene.  


The Others have been ruined since S1:E1 though, so I was never going to be a fan of how this went down.",The only exercise I ever see him doing is javelin throw and 1-rep basic arm lifts.,The only part of the episode I really liked it Arya being Azor Ahai and Sansa and Tyrion reconnecting lol,"A lot of the episode left a bitter taste in my mouth because of characters living through insurmountable odds, and poor decisions made by the greatest minds of Westeros. (And not just poor, down right bad) But Arya killing the Night King was the only decision made by the writers that was a good one. It subverts fantasy, which is what GoT is intended to do. Legends? Dragons? Azor Ahai? Fuck no, one trained and talented person in the right place at the right time.

&#x200B;

Of course that leads to other questions ""Why is the rest of the show not subverting expectations?"" ""How the fuck did Arya even get there?"" All great questions that I'm not willing to argue about. But having Arya kill the Night King? That was the most GoT thing you could possibly do.",what lore/prophecy are u referring to?,"FFS do you need a Arya spinoff to show her training? A lot of stuff in the show is not shown, but implied. The scale of time is also difficult to understand, but ultimately it comes down to not having enough time (or rather audience attention) to do all of that","i never saw him train

They pretty much subverted it with the mountain vs the viper fight. They kind of chickened out of subverting it when lyanna mormont killed and got killed by the giant.",Did you see her fight with Brianne?,"It's sort of a staple of how the series portrays war (and war in general). Kings aren't necessarily toppled by the main protagonist in the end. Robert didn't kill the Mad King, Jamie did. Robb didn't kill Jofferey, Olenna did. Danny didn't kill Tommen, Tommen did. The tides of war don't always change the way we expect.

After coming out on top of so many victories, having Jon deliver the final blow would have rung stale.","Yeah, it totally doesn't make sense for someone who's whole story arc is based on fighting the Night King to actually try to fight him. No, firing Arya out of a clown cannon that was good writing.

I can't wait for the next episode where Yara kills Cersei. Nobody would expect that right? Just because she said is going to the Iron Islands doesn't mean its true! Plus Yara is sneaky too, I mean she almost broke out Theon before he started to freak out! Sneaky, Check. Fight experience, Check. Non-traditional, Double Check.","Both dragons are still alive, it showed them in the preview for next episode",Bruh as she was leaping she was screaming at the top of her lungs...

But they didn't, more than half the time she was there, she was just getting beaten up, then one time she blocked a blow from Waif(after getting beaten up right before that) and all of a sudden she is a master assassin? Ok, fine whatever.... Then she roams around braavos sightseeing after betraying the faceless men... And guess what, got beaten up(or stabbed to be precise) then apparently killed the waif later on... I don't see any sort of progress she made unless getting beaten up makes you a master assassin... And about what you say about the show being time constrained, they had time to show Arya get beaten up in 600 different ways in 600 different scenes, but couldn't spare one scene just for showing her progress? Ok sure","Yeah my favourite part of Game of Thrones is how they completely skip over showing characters training like they did with Arya.

They were horsing around, not fighting to the death. You do realize that had Brienne been swinging her heavy sword with full force, it would have injured Arya seriously, even if that was with the blunt side?

Seems like people think that speed and accuracy is everything in a sword fight. In the real world (And Got accordingly, the books at least) , a sword fight is not a ballet dance, it's ugly and dirty.

There's nothing wrong with having her become some crazy badass but there's everything wrong with doing it all offscreen and expecting everyone to just accept it. So many things about the show rely on you just not questioning it anymore. Melisandre showing up after the army of the dead was already there, and just waltzing towards the lines. Why were there 10+ Wights just wandering around the library when there's still a huge battle going on outside the castle? Why can they hear drops of blood hit the floor but they don't hear her stab one in the chin, which then bleeds a whole bunch? Why the actual fuck did they put their artillery in front of their Unsullied and fire them maybe 4 times? Why did they have basically nobody on the walls but the main characters? Why was nobody defending the gate bar an 8 year old girl and 5 Mormonts? Why had nobody given literally anybody in the crypts a damn knife to at least defend themselves with? Why did the Wights all attack Jon one at a time when they got brought back when literally everyone else gets swarmed by multiple of them?

It's not a bad show but it's just different than what it used to be. It's hard to find flaws like this when you look at the Battle of Blackwater bay, because that was ripped from the books. To me it's quite obvious they're making it a lot more ""What can we do that the fans will think is cool"" instead of ""How can we adapt GRRM's story"".","Well, what is it indeed? The ultimate proof that she is a better swordsman than Jon, even though he came out victorious from mortal perils multiple times as well?

Contrary to popular belief, 1v1 swordfight deathmatches aren't the only way to kill someone. Killing someone who could beat you in a 1v1 with stealth and trickery doesn't mean you'd beat them in a 1v1 either.

  


I don't think Arya has any of the obvious candidates beat in sword fighting skill (Jon, bronn, brienne, etc.) in an all out duel. She's good, but that's not her forte. She does excel at sneaking up on and killing people though, something no one else has quite tried against the night king as far as we know. Even then, she almost failed.","Undead dragon protecting entrance to godswood, Jon distracting undead dragon. In that scene you can see Arya run to the godswood",so all this stuff is from the books. do people expect the show to follow the story line of the books?,"What Arya has been turned into? You mean what GRRM had planned for her, gtfo here with that shit.","why not fit a dragonglass sword for Jaime's hand?

why not have dug a bunch of trenches, pits and moats (instead of just one single one) and put a bunch of WW1-style no-mans-land shit for the army of the dead to get stuck in/get through?

why not have a bunch of boulders and hot oil and shit to throw off the top of the castle? 

why not equip the best archers with dragonglass arrow tips from atop the castle to fire down hundreds of arrows at the WWs?

where are all the other giants? when the army of the dead arrived at the wall, they had a bunch of fuckin undead giants with them. then we see just one single one in the episode - where the hell are all the other giants? I was wondering how tf they would deal with them all...and then they just...didn't exist anymore


seasons 1-4 were the best version of GOT, and it went downhill from there outside some specific episodes. I had no trouble suspending disbelief in previous seasons, because there were real consequences for the characters actions, and nobody was (seemingly) safe at that time. but that became less and less true through season 5, 6, 7, and 8. it just became another same classic fantasy of good vs evil, albeit with a beautiful cinematography, music, stage, and acting in the last few seasons, even if still with plenty of sex and violence.

am interested to see how the last few hours shakes out of course, but hopefully I don't have to suspend disbelief as much",I guess the only real way to know for sure is to have them duel,i'm just really pissed we didn't get to see some of that Night King Dick. like why didn't his clothes burn off like dani's did in season 6. talk about plot armor,"It makes no sense to me how she managed to get that close. Saying she was super sneaky doesn't make sense. The Night King was surrounded by allies who would have been alert at 100%. If one of them even moved a muscle everyone would have seen it or sensed it. Even if she had the time to make a face, just moving would have given her away.","Not word for word. Obviously, that would not be entertaining TV. A bit of creativity and artistic leeway is ok. 

However, the general expectation is that the show follows along with the core ideas of the book. From season 1-4 they had an easy job, look at the source and copy. Once the books ended things had to be made up, but under the expectation that things will have the same rules. If Dani in the show can land in Westros (which hasn't happened in the book), then Jon can fight the Night King in the show. No word on if they actually succeed, I was thinking an untimely death, but what happened in the episode is just a wild break. Thematically it made no real sense unless you lower your expectations and equate GoT to a Marvel movie.","I actually would have loved to see like, a hidden moat of tar or other flammable shit they could light after the dead got to the baracade.","By that logic, it'd make even less sense for someone who can't sneak around to even get remotely close to the night king. (E.g. Jon rushing the night king) Now no one can kill him. Impervious to fire, and surrounded by a loyal army

  


I don't pretend to know exactly how she did it, but I'm hoping they explain in the next episode. Bran was upto something that entire time, god knows what. One of the white walkers did notice her at the last second, but that's it.","yeah they definitely made it seem like jon was the chosen one but this video has some good counterpoints:

If only they paid that much attention to detail with the rest of the season,Fr probably my favourite battle of the show watching Jon trudge through enemy’s and almost getting crushed my dead and dying men and the realization his army was beaten was just so epic to me,"Do you want the one like mine where there are a bunch of guys, or do you want the unedited one where it's just one?

thanks Ross you da man","I really don't have an easy time paying attention to fight or sport scenes. For the most part if there's a fight in a movie I tune out until it's over and check in who won. When I read Harry Potter the first time, I skipped until the end of the quidditch scenes, just skimming to see if anything besides sports was happening. Physical competition is so, so very boring to me.

The battle of blackwater bay was not at all interesting to me. It's, like, important that Joffrey didn't fight, and a few other things, but I don't need to see a bunch of carnage on screen.

His whole character thesis is ""tigers dont change their stripes"" and ""a monster they made me so, a monster i have become""  


Jamie has always been for his family and his sister above all else, he is a classic tragic hero who cant escape who he really is no matter how he tries. Him being with Cersei is all he ever wanted, the only reason he was put on the kingsguard was to separate them.   


I dont understand all the criticism for the writing, especially since everything has been pushing towards this, same goes for The Queen of Ashes",circles are still arcs friend,"Ok a failed redemption arc is completely valid but what is the inciting incident?

Tyrion isn't making bad decisions, he is making decisions to a queen that wants yes men and doesnt take advice. All of the decisions he has made are based on one thing, get ""make Dany queen"" but she isnt fit for the role and is bound to fail, just like his plans.

The differences between how the government chooses to stimulate the economy really come down to ""do we give private individuals the major gains? or not"". A stadium investment is an example of funneling tax money to private corporations. Yes it will stimulate the economy; but so will anything else. The reason for choosing stadiums is because it overwhelmingly funnels public money to private pockets.","According to an article I just read the OKC thunder have provided over 700 million dollars to the OKC economy since their arrival.

Movies, television and society itself usually paints a picture that there are only good people and evil people. Nothing else.

For example: everyone thinks that the Stark’s are the “good” and “honorable” characters, but in reality the are to blame for a lot. Example: Jaime killed the mad king because he thought it was the right thing to do, but then Ned demonized him for it and gave him the name “Kingslayer” making him feel like he was unworthy of being good. If Ned could’ve just put his narcissistic notion of honor to the side to see what Jaime really did, maybe he wouldn’t have ended up trying to kill Bran and maybe he would’ve stopped sleeping with his sister.

Most obvious show case is when she lured Waif in dark cave. In S8E3, she was hiding and evading dead men in a library. **Game Of Faces - mostly misunderstood - here you learn to lie or catch someone that is lying and vice versa, speaking true.   One of best feats.** She used that numerous times, most obvious with Sansa. When she accused Sansa helping Cercei and Joffrey kill Ned Stark, Sansa response was genuine so she already knew Sansa is innocent.  Other very important time is when she played Game of Faces with Sansa. She knew Sansa was innocent, but she wanted to teach her. Sansa asked where she got the note. She was playing with Sansa and at the end she gave her knife - meaning, you wanted to know where did i get note from - here is dagger and connect the dotes. Very important, because most of guys think that Littlefinger doom was when he said that Arya wants to become Lady of Winterfell. No guys, Sansa alrady knew it was littlefinger, she just played Game of Faces with Littlefinger to disclose his attentions. In S8E2, when she was talking with Roberts bastard, she asked about with how many women he slept. He could not lie to her, because she knew when ever someone is lying. **BEING BLIND**: Her hearing sharpened, and to relay on things she knows not she sees. **SNEAKING**: We all remember she sneaked on Jon on same place without Jon hearing her. It is obvious ASSASIAN basic feat. Syrio Forel chasing cat game helped alot. FINAL BLOW: She used the same killing blow when she was fighting with Brienne. **BEING NO ONE - meaning you are disconnected from emotions.** If you have a mission to kill someone, you are suppose not to have feeling toward target.
