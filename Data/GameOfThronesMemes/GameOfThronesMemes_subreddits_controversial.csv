270,bu62i1,Drogon (SPOILER),"So I've been thinking, and everybody says that Drogon burned the Throne because he understands that the Throne killed Daeny, not Jon. But what if the Throne is burned because Drogon was extremely mad at Jon and wanted to get his revenge?

So like: Drogon: ""you kill the thing I love the most, so I kill the thing you love the most"", but what he doesn't know is that Jon doesn't want the Throne and he kills Daeny for the best of the 7 (or 6) Kingdoms?

What are you thoughts?",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesMemes/comments/bu62i1/drogon_spoiler/,2019-05-29 01:49:43

276,braehy,Game of thrones season 8,"I think I am the only one who didn't feel invested when dragon died in episode 4, varys death in episode 5 and dany death scene in episode 6. This is the first time it happens to me I am a huge fan of GOTbut this time I am disappointed let's talk about why and make list how they should do it. I think they had a great storyline but they fucked up in execution so let's start it.

they wanted to do

* they wanted to Arya kill night king

We all know how they did it now, if they make the fight  night king vs Jon snow that scene makes sense Jon fighting with the night king while dany fighting with night king dragon on the sky but Jon snow was failing the mission and Arya stabbed night king from the back and suddenly every walker was falling and dark night turn it to morning.

* They wanted to kill 2 dragons 

we all know how stupid that scene was but now, That dragon should die in the battle of Winterfell or in a battle of kings landing while dany was charging his dragon to kill Cersei army but suddenly she got shot because the cersie army has scorpions and his dragon die and now she retreats from the fight that scene definitely make subverting expectation and his mad queen think justifies because he saw his dragon die in middle of fight 

* Jaime breine sex scene

why they make this happen in the end jaime want to save cersie then why he fuck bran if they show that jaime was preparing to go in kings landing and briene was watching him to do that now she came close to Jaime tell her what she feel about Jaime. now jaime grab brieene passionately and kissed him while tormund watching, Jaime slowly stops and say farewell to brieene (an uncompleted love story) think about it

* Cersie death and jaime lennister

We are watching the game of throne right cersie was the cruel and evil person she doesn't deserve poetic death she deserves worse so, Cersei and jaime captured by the dany in episode 6. She gets to know that Tyrion freed Jaime so she makes Tyrion her prisoner and make Tyrion to see how she will kill Jaime and cerise she burns Jaime and cerise alive while Jaime and Cersei were in each other arms. Screaming of cerise and Jaime make Tyrion cry and angry at same time flames vanished jaime and cersie die in each other arms.

* they killed varys off screen
* They reveal Aegon Targaryen truth to Arya and Sansa offscreen

What kind of ending we saw worst ending according to me if they want to give a happy ending then they should make Jon and Daenerys king or queen. we are not watching marvels movie where we know our favourite character will survive we are watching the game of thrones they should kill Jon snow or make Jon snow their counsellor. what was the point to send him to castle black seriously and why are they going beyond the wall they want to eat ice only most important why bran becomes a three-eyed raven",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesMemes/comments/braehy/game_of_thrones_season_8/,2019-05-21 17:26:27

483,bqacso,"Alternative game of thrones ending, just some random ideas of how things could have gone differently","Danerys rushes to the red keep instead. The unsullied get into formation and they kill each golden company but spares all the civilans except for the a small division with geyworm which defends the gate towards the center with the red keep. She snaps and completely anihilates the red keep, but Jamie and cercei escape on the small boat and they start sailing away . The clegane ball happens but sandor reveals he is actually the faceless guy. He uses his skills to assassinate the mountain but is ineffective like in the show so they have to fight and run as the red keep gets destroyed by Danerys and everything is on fire. Stuff happen and sandor defeats the mountain while overcoming his fear of fire but he ends ups savage damaged, like limbs missing and stuff. In the last moments of his life it cuts to Arya escaping and he says ""at least she didn't become one of me"" as he dies (remember faceless guy transformed  Arya when he died but the didn't change into clegane even though he the closest person to her and the faceless guy knew about him.) . It switches back to the scene with Arya and after that toText you copy will automatically to him being dead on the floor, the dragon in the background and fire and blocks of building falling, from where his scar starts, you can see a face slowly peeling just a bit, just as a big pillars falls and smashes his body and spills blood everywhere.
Danerys lands in the red keep, she looks at the two bodies and says nothing for a second, then just totally cold ""she's not here"" then leaves.
Cuts away to boat
Jamie is bleeding
Cercei takes out his armour and tries to stop the bleeding, she is to scared now, she is changed, she's acting like a completely different person and the only thing she can think about is saving Jamie's life but she can't cause she's too confused and too scared to think and to act. She is weak. When she takes of his shit you can see that the wound is purple and is oozing some black blood. The blade was poisoned by some ironfleet drownman poison. Cercei starts panicking and tells Jamie ""Everything was in truth for you, I wanted to have your baby so I knew you would not leave me, I wanted to protect them cause I knew that was the only thing that made it possible for the two of us to be together. You knew it was wrong. I knew it was wrong. There was no way for us to be toghether and even think about us of being good people if there wasn't for a special reason like a kid. Jamie is calm, the poision is not acting like a normal poision. He bites his lip and red blood start coming a bit from his mouth then it slowing become black just in a small bit. ""I know"" that's all he said, cercei stats panicking even more, ""if we had a kid, we could have been good people for the kids, no matter how much of a monsters we were, we could have carried our sin."" Jamie shouts: ""I KNOW"". Cercei:""I am sorry""
 No music. ""if it wasn't for me, none of this would have happened. It's all my fault. Small pause with silence. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have thrown that stupid brat of the tower and make the Starks stick stupid dog noses into joffrey and he wouldn't have had to kill him and make things get to here. The previous king even wanted to kill that targaryen bitch.
Jamie spills black blood from his mouth then says : ""Maybe we are monsters. I'm tired of being one, aren't you?"" Cercei looks at him and says:I'm sorry.
She losses it, she starts repeating sorry and sorry and she cried as Jamie is unable to speak and dies. ""she kisses him while repeating I'm sorry"" 

Danerys lands on the boat. Cercei lost it. She just repeats"" I'm sorry, I'm sorry "". Danerys is cold. She gets down from the dragon, the dragon sniffs at cercei and her eyes get filled by pure fear. She is scared.
She drops Jamie, she gets on the floor and says with her voice trembling: I'm sorry, you got what you wanted in the end, I don't care what you do with me, but please let my baby live, is the only thing that this world has from him. ""
 ""Get up"". Cercei gets up. She reveals a dagger (maybe a sword with significance or a dagger or a weapon missandre used cause I am not sure) and stabs her belly, just to be sure to stab the baby, just one cut then says: ""dracays"" and right after the fire hits cercei, she kicked her in the water. This makes sure to stop the bleeding, but also messes up her face and hair.
The episode ends here instead and now there's a lot more things to explore in the last episode.
In the preview, it would have been nice if there was a shot of danerys on the iron throne with cercei naked and chained to her throne with her body messed up and just greyworm on her right.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesMemes/comments/bqacso/alternative_game_of_thrones_ending_just_some/,2019-05-19 03:38:19
