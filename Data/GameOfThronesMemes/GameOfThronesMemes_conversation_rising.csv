0,Rickon has it worse than the 3rd Manning brother,Rickon should’ve learned to not run in a fucking straight line... might still be alive.,"Damn, I just sat there and thought ""what am I missing? 3 Kings? There are Robb, Bran and....?"" and totally forgot about Jon. Guess at the end he felt not that important after all.",He's also supposed to be like 4 years old...,I can't wait to know what became Rickon in Skagos. A wild lord?,"Crusader Kings 2 when both parents have the genius trait and master level in each skill. 

The kids they raise will be OP, Rickon must have been the extra that got some dumb courtier for a guardian.",Respect Man!!!!,they also sort of raised  a cockless coward too,Is Sansa really a queen tho or did bran just not wanna deal with her?,First of all Rickon was supposed to be like 3 when his parents died.... and second he didn't have the plot armor that Arya Bran and Sansa did. If he had who knows what he would be,He’s like the fourth Jonas brother.,Bradley Manning?,"Serpentine,  Babou! Serpentine!",He dunt want et,She’s Mah Queen,Exact same for me.,Yea I was gonna say that. He was like a super small kid when he basically loses his family and then is raised by someone else.,A unicorn lord,Spitting truths ^^^,There's a fourth?,There is no reason why anyone mentions them except they paid for the media hype over a decade later,"Cooper, but good joke",*he remembers me!*,Raised by a goddamn wildling,"Would be nice, but i think, don't fits.",Bradley Cooper?,Yes,I laughed harder at this thread than is reasonably  appropriate!,What movie,Hobbs and Shaw,life is unfair.,I wouldn’t lose my head over it.,But Arya is the one in the middle !?,r/whoooosh,Woah woah its nearly the end of 2019,Its funny because on New Years Eve this year I did break my foot after hitting it on the couch.,He’s not wrong though,[deleted],New Year’s Eve this year hasn’t happened yet? Unless you live in New Zealand,Rekt,You know what I mean,"Meanwhile Arya gets stabbed a few times in the stomach, dumped into sewer water and she's just fine...",Tis but a scratch!,I laughed too hard at this.,Actually it was for the moon of his life,Poison scratch,To be fair that Maegi put wack stuff in the poultice,Bacteria: allow us to introduce ourselves,r/unexpectedmontypython,I was honestly waiting for someone to say that,It’s a double edged sword however you look at it,But Dany proved herself wrong by decimating King's landing which I completely blame on writers and not her,Somehow seems darker than usual,But she did.,Impossible. He got his willy snipped.,Probably the only story arc that never lost momentum.,YOU EITHER DIE A VILLIAN LONG ENOUGH YOURSELF BECOME OR LIVE TO SEE THE HERO,yes he played a very great role,"My dad started making our genealogy tree like 3-4 years ago. Up to now, he has found family members up yo 1750s. Taking in consideration Poland hasn't existed for 123 years, survived the partitions, being other countries territory, endured two world wars and couple more others... it is a big thing. 
And yeah, he's more like Ned here, he goes to many churches, talks to people, goes to city archives etc. It's kinda cool.",The seed is strong,I am a Lannister but am black of hair. Something's wrong I can feel it,It's a ponderers tome.,nahh they use incestry.com,Hats off to him! He is a true scholar.,"""Poland hasn't existed for 123 years"" makes it seem like Poland went extinct 123 years ago lol",How? Does he randomly show at some churches up and ask for your familyname what happend? Im interested to do also some research on my family.,"Pardon me my English. We had a time in history called Partitions if Poland when Russia, Austria and Prussia divided up our territory. And we didn't exist until the end of WWI. As a country - as the nation, Poles were much or less protecting themself of the russification or germanization.","I would have to ask him but I think majority of his job was going the churches, especially the churches where was our known family members baptised, or got married or died/were born. The churches normally may have the archives where they have the info. With infos about them he had some clues about the places of birth of the people (if they came from different place). The biggest problem here was Russian and German languages (we live at the old Russian-Prussian border in the north of Masovia region). 

He was also looking in the Internet for the people with our surname, and because it is really uncommon, the chances for the people for being our far-far family was quite big. Sometimes they refused to share the infos (probably being afraid of some testament heritage blah blah) but normally they do share at least the info for closest family. Which makes the thing easier for you can try to connect the dots and find mutual ancestors.",Yeah I understood from the context I just thought it was an entertaining line. Have a great day!,Incest is wincest -Cersei and Jaime,Stop posting this. You're not even using the meme correctly,with 11 different cunts and spices,That's it! I'm getting me some fucking chicken right now.,"“You’re going to die for some chickens?”
“Someone is”","I still remember seeing a fake commercial for KFC where they did a ""every fucking chicken in this place"" deal using the hound, and I wish I could find that again",Man this is fucking gold,I’d kill for 4 buckets.,*All the chickens you have,"No. A common saying, but not their official motto.",Should be a dog eating 3 chickens,thats hell,Lyanna
