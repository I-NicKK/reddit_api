Murdering babies and burning children is okay, shanking a pregnant woman in her pregnant belly is okay, forcing a woman to brutally beat another for some kind of sadistic gratification is okay, but god forbid you portray any non-consensual sex. 

""But wait, wasn't there rape in the first season?""

Shut your whore mouth, this is different. This is fuckin' Sansa we're talking about, bro. Not cool. Someone call Congress.

it just needs more joy and positive feelings/relationships -making it even more realistic","The problem isn't that Sansa got raped. The problem is that this didn't happen to her in the books and it added nothing to her story or character arc. They built her up since the end of season 4 (lying for littlefinger, black dress, etc) just for her to get raped mid season 5 and flee with Theon as the payoff. It's bad writing and makes you wonder what the point of it was.","Read the article.  Both of the big complained scenes this season were NOT in the books.

",Do you guys not see his username?

Jamie is purposely shown to do something absolutely reprehensible, so that he can be established as a villain (who we later see develop into an anti-hero). ",How about staying with his sister after she murdered thousands of innocent people?,"Firstly, it's hear, not here.

But, to your points. To say he did ""nothing"" wrong is an over simplification of the circumstances. 

Maybe in that universe you can't choose whom you love, they've said it enough times. But if I found out my husband was really my brother, yikes! And sure I'd still love him but not in the same way, I.e. romantic love would evaporate faster than ice in the Sahara. 

As for pushing Bran out the window, you say he was protecting his family and preventing a war  between Tywin and Robert. Jamie couldn't have given less fucks at the moment. There was no agonizing decision, he just casually pushed a 10 year old boy out the window with a sarcastic comment.

Robert Baratheon was a homicidal psycho that had absolute power in the Seven Kingdoms, and who was only slowed down in middle age by the consequences of long term drinking and whoring.    Ned's 'honor' would have put his friendship with that man above the lives of Tommen, Myrcella, and countless younger Lannisters at Casterly Rock (Willem and Martin, anyone?).   He even said as much to Cersei when he learned the truth and confronted her.   Jaime was in a no win situation.  He pretended to be flip about it, but he had no good choices.  ","Oh another Brienne x Jaime fan, oh my sweet summer child.","The only other option Jaime had was to kill Robert Baratheon, the king whom everyone adored in the home of his bff.  That would probably not have stopped the carnage that was to follow, but most of the Lannisters would have survived, as I can't see Ned killing Cersei's children for her and Jaime's actions.  Ned was far more level headed than Robert.  It was his loyalty to Robert that was the problem.  

Yes, pushing Bran was cold blooded, but sometimes such things are necessary.  If Little Finger hadn't been brewing the Stark/Lannister war already, it might have saved thousands of lives, including Jaime's children.  If they died it would have been due to their own choices, not payment for the sins of their forebears.  

As for the false equivalent of stealing in the earlier reply, if the only means of feeding your family and keeping them safe was stealing, then you would be justified.  If you had other options that didn't put yourself or others at risk, then it wouldn't.  As Ned Stark admitted when he confronted Cersei in Kings Landing, had Robert found out about Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen's true parentage, he would have had them killed.  If Cersei, Jaime, and the rest of their family had fled, they all would have been hunted down, even the children.  Other than killing another king and setting off who knows how many wars, Jaime's only choice was to push Bran.  Sometimes life throws us lemons that can't be made into lemonade.

I'm not entirely convinced that's the case here. Not burning your hands on a hot egg, and in a small fire is much different than lighting your entire body on fire.

> It's discussed in the ""inside the episode"" after s01e10 if you're interested in hearing the directors talk about it

I respect them both. They've made an amazing show. But at the end of the day this is only their interpretation of the books. Unless I hear it direct from GRRM I'm going to be skeptical of thinking she _knew_ she was going to be okay.

Instead, I choose to believe that she was simply grief strucken (which she was) and wanted to give up. Even her dialogue with Jora just before hints at it;

> Jorah: Khaleesi, my Queen, I vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be...but let him go, Khaleesi. I know what you intend. Do not.

> Danny: I must... You don't understand.

> Jorah: Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. I won't watch you burn.

> Danny: Is that what you fear? \*kiss\*

Then she speaks to the Khalasar--talking about slaves and stuff. But she makes __no__ indication that she may survive except that ""all who would do harm to the Khalasar would die screaming,"" but again, I'm not entirely convinced. But after that, she enters the pyre--but you can see that she's visibly scared.

If the show runners are making their intentions clear, then either they've consulted with GRRM and that is their combined vision for the show and he's on board with the show story, OR the show and books are controlled independently and GRRM does not get final say in how the show runners interpret the books.  Either way, the show runners have their own version of the story that is being told differently than the books (for better or for worse).

As for that dialogue.. 

In the episode where she is in Qarth (Season 2, maybe episode 6-7?), she tells someone that she dreamt that the dragons would be born in the fire, and that's why she went into it.   If you re-read those lines of dialogue with that in mind, i think it makes a lot more sense why she's telling him ""You don't understand"" and ""is that what you fear?"".

I'm almost positive this is the way it goes, unfortunately. I think GRRM directed 1 episode per season so far, out of respect, but I don't think it was anything formal. If I get the interpretation right, then HBO and the directors/writers of the show purchased the rights to use the storyline to create the shows adaptation.

In answer to OP's question, you bet your damn ass it is.

Basically, it justifies and explains why the show is so merciless and brutal to its characters and fans. It may not be perfect but I think you should give it a shot.",It seems like people who read the books hate the recent seasons of the show. I haven't read the books and have been enjoying the show.,uhhhhhhhh....... YOU BET IT IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It's like Dallas with ponies. But infinitely better. ,"If you like book 1, then the show is a must! I put off watching the show until last year when I finally read the first book. Binged the whole series until I was caught up, then continued with the rest of the books, lol","If you enjoyed Lord of the Rings, wrap it up in some bubblewrap and store it away somewhere safe. Game of Thrones made it hard to watch any sort of other fantasy other than gritty and darkness.","I tell my friends that it's great and they should definitely watch. And in the same breath I say ""but don't get attached to ANY of the characters!""","Yes, yes.

Yes it is.","The show followed the books very closely the first few seasons, and adapted it perfectly. It began as an excellent show. 

Last season and a bit before that, a few things were changed around but it accomodated the story moving at a reasonable pace while still keeping the spirit if the show. Still excellent.

This season, the show is trodding and meandering and has a bunch of horribly shot filler. Decent show at best.

So watch it if you want, just know by the time you're done binging, it might be a year or two while you're left with a sour taste in your mouth",no.

","I would disagree with that guy and say that the first 4 seasons were brilliant and the 5th one has been the one that has faltered. With the books this season is where major deviations have occurred. Bookreaders like to nitpick but the first 4 seasons were pretty damn close to the books especially with the main plot points. This season however has been divergent because they are adapting 2 books into one season. Lots of characters have been omitted. With that, the show is still great, better than most shows imo. ","Well for one they have eliminated the only plot lines in the book that held any hope in contrast to the bad things that happen. Everything they have added to the story is vulgar and meaningless (aside from one or two things). Every character they add is either a whore or a cliche. One added was good but she died within twenty minutes. It seems that most of the book characters have become stagnant, as they have skipped over parts of their journey where the characters develop more, change, learn and grow (one of my favorite things about the books). I'm assuming this is because they don't want TV favorites to change and risk being disliked by the audience. 
It's still one of my favorite stories, but I don't want to watch next season. I will just wait patiently for TWOW.

* 

I hope that helped.","It will be very difficult/virtually impossible to watch this show if you have a hard time with sex and violence, as it's notorious for including very significant amounts of both these things.  There is nudity (often full-frontal and including sex) and graphic violence in nearly every episode.  You will likely even find the books difficult to read if violence turns you off so strongly, as they go into great detail and the violence is often intentionally upsetting.

If you don't mind me asking: I see that you're a filmmaker, and I'm wondering how you could get through film school without watching and carefully analyzing copious amounts of sex and violence depicted on screen.  How is that even possible?","There's constant sex and violence.  If you can't or don't want to handle it, you might want to find another option.  That said, it's a fantastic show, and I hope you give it a shot.","This is probably too late for your assignment, but I thought I'd add my perspective as I'm also very squeamish when it comes to realistic depictions of violence, and I absolutely think this show sometimes goes a little overboard. That said, it's still very much worth watching. It's simply the best-written show in this genre that I've ever seen. I just close my eyes when violence erupts. Most of the violence is easy to predict - battles scenes, sword fights, torture scenes, etc. I can think of only one instance that really caught me off guard, but I was able to shut my eyes before the goriest part. The nudity doesn't bother me, and truly, you should get over that - it's the human body after all. But violence is a little different. I don't want to nor do I think we, as a society, should become desensitized to it. We *should* be horrified by it.","Do you need to watch every episode of the show? That's a tall order for one class. 

If you know anyone who's a big fan you could ask them to watch it with you and tell you to prepare for what's coming, especially if they'll refresh their memory by fast-forwarding through the show before they watch it with you so you know they won't forget something that's coming up. I (another super wimpy movie watcher, you're not alone!) had a good experience watching Zombieland with someone who really wanted me to see it. He watched the movie shortly before seeing it with me, then watched it with me and would tell me when something was coming. I'd cover my eyes and he'd tell me what was happening. 

I'm better at seeing violence and gore than I used to be, and I think watching some older movies (like the Exorcist) for a film studies class is one of the main things that helped me. The special effects weren't as good back then, and it helped ease me into the violence of edgier stuff like GoT. Also just telling myself that I'd try very hard not to cover my face when I knew graphic stuff was coming
made me toughen up. I'd been depriving myself the opportuntiy to get better at it by never exposing myself to that imagery without my hand flying to my face or looking away.

Anyway, I feel you and your problem, and I wish you good luck!",Quite. ;),"Kid's entertainment/animation is my focus, to answer your question. Surprisingly, the classes I'm taking (which are not animation-based) haven't gone too far into major sex and violence. That, and I've developed a thicker skin as time's gone by- I had a really sheltered upbringing and I've had to grow from that. But, if what I've heard about the Red Wedding is true, perhaps I'd be better off with the books. I can always look at photos for the costume designs, which is what the class is about. :) Thank you for helping me out!","I really doubt you need to read the books for this assignment if it's focused on the television series. You can just read plot summaries online if you are truly that squeamish.

That said, I wonder if you're just overestimating how violent the show is compared to other popular media. It's a violent show, but the content wouldn't be out of place for a rated R film. And because it's HBO there is nudity, but you can ""look away"" and not miss anything. As long as you are not upset by strong language I think you will be fine to at least try it.","Hmm, I guess I still wonder how you could study those things without also studying other genres of film (many of which focus on sex and violence specifically). 

Anyway, yes, I would say you'd be better off with the books and supplementing them with images found online.  Of course, I think you'd still be missing out and I would encourage you to give the show a try if you think you're up for it, but if you have such trouble with violence then it will likely be very upsetting to you.  For example, I'm a pretty big fan of cinema and have seen *a lot* of very violent movies, but there is one particular scene in the show that is one of the most graphic and disturbing acts of violence I've ever witnessed.  It is truly infamous.  Likewise, while the sex and nudity doesn't quite reach the level of softcore porn that you'd have found on Cinemax in the 90's, it sometimes gets close.","Did you mean to say ""wouldn't be out of place for an R-rated film""?  Because this show is at least R-rated.",The books are at least as explicit as the show. More so when you consider that a vast number of the characters who are adults in the show are in fact minors in the books. I would not recommend that anyone who is too squeemish for the show go anywhere near the books. You're best bet is to read the episode summaries.,"Yes, that's what I meant, thanks. No scene in Game of Thrones would be unacceptable for a film with an R rating.","The movie ""Harry Brown"" has David Bradley, Iain Glen, Liam Cunningham and Forbes Keir-Bucknall.",great movie,I'm going to have to rematch it soon. Loved the film.,I'm going to have to rematch it soon. Loved the film.,And it's also an amazing film!,">The first episode had incest, murder, child murder to protect the secret of incest

Pretty much par for the course.

>no clear protagonist

This is pretty big. If you can't handle a show like that, then you won't like GoT. GoT isn't about following a plot through the eyes of a protagonist. It's about creating a world and putting *multiple* people in it with distinct characters and letting the story flow from that. What this means is there are *a lot* of main characters. I like it, not everyone will.

>there's rape and the death of beloved characters waiting ahead.

There's also a whole bunch of stuff that you'll cheer at. It's not *all* tragedy, just like life. Life has its ups and downs.","It's a great story, but if you can't handle tragedy, it isn't for you.","If you need one clear protagonist, keep on moving; this is not the show for you. If you don't like dark stories, which will break your heart and shock you, this is not the show for you.

I quit the first episode much earlier on. I didn't give it another try until a few weeks before Season 2 was about to start; everyone I knew was going nuts about Season 2- OMG. 

My feelings were the same as the first time. I wasn't really drawn into it, and then Bran was knocked off the tower. That was when I knew that this was something different from what TV has always brought us in the past. I gave it a few more episodes and by episode 5, I was hooked.

TL;DR I think the first episode probably worked better for book readers; I almost quit on it on two separate occasions. Be prepared to go dark places with a mass of dubious protagonists. ","It's great, but it may not be for you if you have that strong reactions. There are some episodes which are very likely too far for you.","It's not a feel-good show. It's not a Hero's epic with a Hero who will save the day, kill the dragon and get the princess. 

It is, however, the most amazing fantasy story ever written. It's a lot more realistic than, for instance, Tolkiens work. Wars are won with diplomacy more than just big armies fighting. There is no clear 'good' or 'evil'. There is not 1 important thing that needs to be done to save the world. And most of all, no character is ever as simple as Tolkien shows them. Virtually all GoT characters are complex, 'real' people with a backstory and emotions and motives. All have flaws, and no 2 characters are the same. That is what makes this the best fantasy series I've ever read/seen. 

EDIT: Unless you have a very good reason not to, I suggest you watch the first ~4 episodes, and from there on continue if you want to. You can always stop if you don't think it's for you, but I promise, it's all worth it.","This show is one of my favorites, but it is absolutely not for everyone. My father gave up on it after one particularly brutal scene because he just doesn't like watching upsetting things. 

If you didn't like the ending to that first episode, it's tough. The show has much more devastating moments than that. But if you are willing to go into it prepared, it might be worth it.","The first episode is what got me hooked, and it really represents some of the main themes in the show. They will be present throughout the whole series, and if you are seriously bothered by them, then I would advise you not to continue watching it. As the story moves forward, there are death scenes that are really gore-ish, and unlike most shows, not many good things happen. I think it's so good because the tragic events just make the plot so much richer in a way, and it's not like movies that you just KNOW everything will somehow fix itself. More devastating or plot-altering things happen than good ones, that's why people are so hyped, because they want to know what consequences those events bring.  


If what bothers you the most are the sex scenes, they really drop in the third and fourth season. Most of the seasons also have sort of a ""main character"", not a defined one, but between the amount of characters they are the ones who get more screen time. Keep in mind though, that LOTS of new characters are introduced each season. Way more than those you saw in the first episode. 


All in all, maybe try watching 2 more episodes to see if you manage to like the plot, but honestly this is most likely not the show for you. ","If you take __anything__ away from this thread, then let it be _this_: 

_Game of Thrones is the single most disastrous thing you'll ever have in your life._ It's much like __Heroin__. It ruins your life. You know it does. But you just fuckin' need it inside of you. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll bargain with God(s) to unsuccessfully protect your favorite characters and at the end you won't be able to wait for the next episode.

_Don't do it. Save yourself._","As other people have said, its not for everyone. 
Personally, its my favorite show. Diologe scenes are just as gripping as a battle.
Its not a fairy tale. Its dark and its adult. If that's not your bag, then no shame.
If you are looking for something like it, but not quite as dark, I suggest Reign on CW.","The thing about having characters that you love die is that you have to love them first.

If you like shows with great, nuanced characters then you will like GoT.","During season 1, I watched the first episode and nothing else. It just didn't click with me. After the first season ended, all my friends who knew my taste in shows kept telling me to watch it, just get 2 or 3 episodes in and you'll get hooked. 

I listened and I'm still hooked, some of the characters take a couple episodes for you to get to understand. ","Always give a show at least 3 episodes.  A rule of my wife's.  If after 3 you still aren't digging it, move on.

Some scenes in GOT are kind of dull (there are some arcs I really don't care to watch any more) but the fantastic scenes more than make up for it.","The first episode throws you off but there is something about it that makes you want to watch further. And before you know it, you're watching five episodes per day, with your jaw dropping every ten minutes.

I started the series in March and finished the first three seasons in a week and half. ",[removed],"The nudity tones down as the show goes on. Season 1 is the worst. But that's typical with HBO...the first season is 75% sex...then the story kicks in. 

I had the same problem when I first tried to watch it. Then I heard about little things that happened in the story and tried again. Give it time, you will get hooked.

Despite all the downers, you have a lot of victories and reasons to push through. Hope.

I suggest to continue, b/c you sound a lot like I did. And now, I love the show.","HODOR!
","So I watched the first episode around 2 years ago and I hated it. Like I HATED IT. However around Jan of last year I had nothing to watch so I figured I would give the show another chance.The first few episodes are tough to watch because they are, IMO, really slow but they have a bunch of characters to develop in such a short period.

Once you get in to around episode 5 it picks up. I now really like the show. People dying sucks but it makes the show special because NO ONE IS SAFE. So if they put someone in a situation that they may die, they very well may die. Unlike normal shows where a main is about to die and by random chance something safes them at the very last second because they are not able to die.

Watch the show, it is awesome. One of my favorites now.

Also I told my Uncle and Cousin to watch the show and after the first episode they almost stopped watching but they followed through and now they love it.",One thing with the nudity: It's still certainly present in the vast majority of episodes but it still significantly declines after the first season or two.,"Keep watching.  I thought the first 3 episodes were shit, but I was wrong.  Very wrong.  It is easily one of the best TV shows of all time.  The only reason it isn't number one (in my opinion) is that it the series is still ongoing.",No.,"I tell everyone that you need about 8 episodes in before you ""get it."" Power through it and you'll happily be an encyclopedia of the GoT lore.","Like the villains, they have certain fun qualities. ","You should read the books.

The show is a big shock to the system the book still contains all the same details but its more evenly passed 

you can actually get your head around what's happening.","The way I got hooked is actually odd. I would glimpse a few climactic or epic scenes of various episodes while my parents watched it, then I finally decided to sit down and watch it from the beginning, because I knew even of things were slow, that there were great moments ahead.","I know how you feel about the first few episodes, but like most good TV series, the beginning of the first season is all about character and plot structure. You would enjoy the show if you give it a proper chance. But bare in mind, once you reach the 7th or 8th episode, there's no looking back for you. ","Yo few_boxes,

this is a great question because there are a lot of people I know who won't watch it because it is gory or has nudity and I am pretty sure that I am not the only one.

The first thing to remember is that this show is about a large continent that is by and large at war, though the battle element waxes and wanes the threat hangs over the world.

To be perfectly honest, you are not the only one who doesn't like the ""no clear protagonist"" thing - In my opinion it is one of the shows greatest strength, this is because the show is inspired by real historical events, and like history the whole story is shown from different perspectives and there is no true ""goody"" or ""baddy.""

Actually the show is very good at censoring itself [believe it or not] there are a number of very brutal scenes throughout which quite frankly could have been far worse - I won't spoil them here though.

Finally, on a personal note - I don't really like the first season that much either, unfortunately I foreshadows a great number of things and really REALLY triggers most of the major plots.  The show goes from strength to strength very quickly and the show just gets better and better.","I tend to be very behind on modern TV (Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Mad Men, etc)

I would watch that over and over. ","ah right, I assumed it was 2 names but because it wasn't N or E for Ned, I was confused. Cheers","I thought they had, though? At least with the highest branch of the Targaryen line: the one doing the ruling. Wasn't that the point of the incest, to keep the blood pure?","It would be so sweet and more to the heart (pun intended) of GRRM'S style. I think Jon will kill her then the traitors in The Watch.

","From time to time they had been married out of the family, but they were mainly incest. That being said, sometimes succession would lead to children inheriting when they shouldnt because of deaths and such. ",Cannot wait until the launch!!!! This is getting me excited,"I'm thinking I need to watch the last series to prepare, or at least get my plot points in order
","Have to believe you’re in the minority’s on that statement.  Don’t be disappointed, just look forward to the books being finished to see some differences. The show has always been extremely well done. Even if it isn’t exactly the same as the books.",No. You're wrong. It's okay. We understand some people like to hate for attention. You got attention. Now go complain about something else super popular.,"Yeah. It's bad. We waited over a year for this season, not to mention staying with the show for so many years to lead to this half developed beat sheet of a TV show.",L,"We've already seen enough hints to know what is going on.


Here's what we know:

-In season 2, when Robb learns of the Greyjoy attack on Winterfell, Roos Bolton tells Robb that he is sending his ""bastard son"" to deal with it.

-When Theon eventually gets surrounded at Winterfell, he gets extremely pissed off at a horn being blown all night long.

-In season 3, Theon is captured and strapped to an 'X' while being tortured.

-When Jaime and Brienne are brought to the Bolton camp, we see them flying flags with the sigil of an 'X' and and upside down man.

-Theon's torturer blows a horn to wake him in the same scene he mutilates Theon's finger.


At that point you can figure out what is going on and who is holding Theon.",That X is the sigil of Roose Bolton (the guy who killed Robb) so it was most likely just marking that his troops were there.  But that may tell us something...,"The flayed man on the cross is the symbol of the Bolton family. Roose Bolton is [S3 Episode 9](/s the guy at the wedding who sat next to Catelyn Stark, the one with the chainmail sleeve and the smug face). 

You've seen that symbol before on the flags of his men, who [S3 Episode 3](/s took Jaime and Brienne captive and cut off Jaime's hand). 

The figures on the map could mean that there's a contingent of those soldiers at the wedding. I don't think it's meant to represent Theon getting tortured in the middle of the army.","That big X is quite the giveaway as the who has Theon, isn't it?",[removed],Thank you.,"Upon rewatching the first part of season 3 in S0302, when Brienne and Jaime were crossing the bridge and they are caught by Bolton's horsemen, Jaime remarks [""The flayed man of House Bolton... a bit gruesome for my taste,""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yc6O6w9mdA&t=7m4s) (no spoilers, link directly to youtube clip of that line in the show). Then I seemed to notice every clue after that about the flayed man on the X as their sigil. I didn't pick up on it the first time, but after seeing so much of Theon being tortured in that room it became obvious upon reviewing. That line alone was so obvious I feel like an idiot for missing it, but guess a lot of other people missed it too. Probably because Theon's flaying and torture hadn't been shown at that point yet.",[deleted],Did not know that. But on the video I linked you see the X from the front at exactly one minute in and there's an upside down guy on it. So it's not just the plain X it looks like from most of the camera angles.,Never noticed that before. Well at least now I'm pretty sure the Boltons have Theon.,Comments like this are not appreciated in this subreddit.,He's not doing it for Stark. He's doing it because he finds it fun.,Yea the X with an upside down man is Bolton's sigil you can see it on his armor,"I'm pretty sure torturing theon also gives them information on the whereabouts of the other Starks, namely that rick and bran are still alive.

We really all hate that character so much.,He was my favorite cunt too ):,"I have nightmares about him.  

He manages to twist everything you say in such a way that you are inadvertently going to get tortured or murdered.

Can I have a scene with actual character development and exposition and story? Maybe another scene of Tyrion chatting Jaime, maybe Jon and Sam chatting about the history of the Night's Watch, maybe Jorah explaining the history of the Targaryans... nope... just another scene of Joffrey being a royal prick. Hooray. Yep. Yep, got it! He's the bad guy. Thanks.""",OP is almost as bad as Olly,Fuck me right?,"I despised his character. He played it incredibly well. Mad respect for him.

He has a whole long speech about it and says most people are pretty nice to him.,"I know everyone hated him, but he was such a brat he actually made me laugh and cry at the same time. Nothings better than a good villain :P","Dude! It's just a tv show, you shouldn't get anxious by someone who dosen't exist. ","I find it a but odd that GRRM even has characters like Joffrey or Ramsay. He's usually into the whole ""no one is fully evil nor a saint"" thing where people's morality are varying shades of gray. Yet we have Joffrey and Ramsay with next to no redeemablw traits and the reasoning for why they are like that just being ""they were just born evil and sadistic"".",meh alot of those bad scenes where there to remind you how shitty he is cuz he hides it well ,/r/fuckolly,You want a good villain? Take a look at little finger and bask in his beautiful lies.,"I think that's a sign of how good the show is, because it is able to Elicit  that feeling.","So...you don't like that there's a variation on the theme of variation of good and bad traits in peoples' character that GRRM set up? In other words, if people are just different mixed bags of good and bad traits aren't there bound to be ones that are mostly evil? or mostly good?","Hardly. The only time I've ever seen him resemble nice to someone was speaking to Sansa in S1 and treating her like a lady.

He's King of the Ashes just protecting his dominion.,"I said I find it odd, not that I don't like it.",I particularly enjoyed the bit about picking grains of sand out of feminist meat ,"Soundtrack, the uniqueness of it all, the production values and vast and beautifully constructed plotlines. CGI, and acting as well.","Every aspect of production in the majority of episodes leaves each one feeling like a cinematic experience to me. It's quite a visual spectacle all the time and the story keeps me engaged. There is no product out there that can compete in terms of quality/quantity balance.

Edit: It also creates highly jovial gatherings, too! That is something really cool that takes a special show for sure.","The characters and their development, is a big one for me. So interesting to see how life events change Arya, Sansa, Jaime, the Hound, etc. Trying to figure out why Cersei is so terrible, what Littlefinger is up to. Jon growing from Bastard of Winterfell to the King in the North. Going back to re-watch episodes, and catching some tidbit of foreshadowing I missed the first time. The landscapes, the castles, the Wall. All of the surprises, and twists and turns.

It blows every other show out of the water, to me.","I tend to get bored quite easily with shows. For me, it was how great of a story every character had behind them. Then the character development each of them had. ","Story and dialogue would be my top 2. But of course it's more than that. Casting, production, camerawork, acting, rewatchability. Everything about it is perfect. Nothing else I've seen even comes close. And that's saying something since there is a lot of great television out there. For example, I LOVED Breaking Bad. Really, really loved it. But it's still so far behind GOT in my eyes. ","The show has it all and appeals to many different people. For me, I like how the characters are intertwined in a clever and dynamic way. Each brings something unique and vital to the story line, no matter how long or short of a time the character spends onscreen. Trying to solve how the story might end and the plot twists keep me coming back for more. What are we all going to do when the series ends?","As others have mentioned, the character arcs reel people in because it's so easy to emotionally invest in them. But for me, it's the escapism the story offers. We're talking about a world full of dragons and armies and people coming back from the dead, don't forget.",Depth of characters.,"The story is extremely engaging and the episodes, especially the early ones, are cliffhangers. So you have to keep going, and before you know it, you're hooked. Why did Jaime push Bran out the window? What's going to happen with Sansa and Joffrey?

You need the answers, so you have to keep watching.","Individual character arcs, cinematography, costumes, writing, acting, and most importantly: giant looming threat that few know about. This means, no matter which sister is fucking what brother on camera, you as a viewer know... these sick fucks need to get their shit together. It creates a lasting, ever building tension throughout the story. You're always engaged. ",Defentally agree with you. Also have to say that feeling of no one being safe pulled me in too.,"Also! The soundtrack is incredible. You got me thinking of the way some scenes make me feel, and I think the music is a big part of it. I found the soundtrack is included on Amazon Prime, currently playing parts while walking my dog, makes it feel like we're on an epic adventure. :)",Lots of people can hold a candle to their arm without flinching- it's called pain tolerance. ,"If you consider Jon a Targ, he burnt his hand while at Castle Black.

You're overthinking this as ""a major plot hole.""","Cersei knew about the stockpile of wildfire in the bunker available to use in defense of the city. Anyone (like Tyrion) could go into the bunker and see it. 


The wildfire hidden under buildings for the destruction of the city is a completely different can of worms. And something cersei wouldn't be able to independent confirm - hence its a rumor. ",I mean it will be cool to see everyone burn in the sept of Baelor. I feel like Tommen may be a casualty in the burning. Maybe Loras will burn half his face like in the books but if this rumor/prediction is true I think that all the sparrows and margarey will die in the sept. I think Cersei will think Tommen had left before he enters but is ultimately burned alive as well.. ,"True, she knows that the pyromamcers can produce wildfire, but she doesn't know about all the caches of wildfire the Mad King placed around the city.","How is nobody talking about Jamie saying ""I would burn down cities for Cersei""????? That can't be just random choice of metaphors",I know but I mean seriously how much could Tyrion have used. I mean have you seen the scene of Tyrion staring into aisles of wildfire.

OP. Consider this too. As Dany was never truly recognized or coronated as queen, simply killing Cersei doesn't equate coronation. Tyrion is the last living and oldest male descendant of the throne. As Jon continued to abdicate the throne as the true living heir. By Westerosi law of inheritance of the crown it would fall from cersei to Tyrion. This could've been true as well.","I think you don't understand the problem. There is nothing wrong with the story, storytelling is just bad.",That's exactly the point. The outcome is what geaorge rr Martin has told to D&D. But he didn't tell how to reach that point. So without building up the story D&D just directly came to that point with completely illogical and utter bullshit script.,"Yeah it's not the story. It's the way the story was told.

In the Last Watch there is a very moving last act detailing how the producers and creatives who have worked and struggled alongside each other for a decade come to terms with the realisation that they will be going separate ways.

I just wish I got the same feeling from the series...",The amount of mental gymnastics undertaken here that’s necessary to justify this ending simply proves how bad it was. TYFYS,"Yeah, most people (in my experience) don’t have a problem where where the plot ended but how the plot got there. 

Complaining about characters in a show not ending up how you wanted is childish and entitled and I don’t think that’s what *most* people are doing (there are definitely some). I do believe most people’s negative reaction to the finale was just in how it was presented. This is a show that used to spend several episodes/seasons depicting how a character grows, changes, and learns. Now we’re given seven episodes of some of the fastest moving plot lines at the most important time of the story and expected to understand the minutiae of character conflict and development when it was shittily written to begin with. Wanting a story that was previously told deliberately and elaborately to continue with the same method of storytelling is a very valid desire.","They skipped about a season and half to get us here.  

Foreshadowing is not character development.   

I'm sorry you disagree.   

It's about more than just rushing.  

They didn't show their work and the work they did show was bad.","The mere fact that anyone has to go to great lengths to justify each plot point and connect the dots is a clear indication that it wasn’t executed properly. We had to sit tight for 7 whole seasons only to have everything crumble right in our faces within the course of a few episodes. Having said that, she show could’ve lasted 4 seasons with the exact plot points if it being so rushed wouldn’t damage the overall quality - but the thing is that it would and this season is a living proof that it did. And also, if the point of the whole Azor Ahai prophecy was for Jon to kill Dany, I think that Bobby B might as well have been the prince that was promised since he was the first to vouch for the execution of the remaining Targaryens. Still, too much time and energy was devoted to the whole war of the Dead vs. the Living and, as Jon pointed out to Dany numerous times in season 7, the leitmotif of the story was putting aside the whole game of thrones and uniting against the common enemy. And someone who decided to risk a whole army and even her life to fight to save the people couldn’t just snap in one episode and kill them all. Jon who was the epitome of someone who got the shit done couldn’t be reduced to a side character with 2 lines of dialogue. Bran who possesses all the knowledge of the world (and should thus be in a position of power) didn’t deserve to be put there after all he had done with that knowledge turned out to either cause a complete destruction or have no impact whatsoever.","Interesting point about the people’s love for Jon being the tipping point of Dany’s madness, and how important it was to see how good of a person she was before she went insane, because that is exactly what happened to her brother.  Vicerous (sp?) went insane when he realized that he would never be loved by the people as well as Dany was.  If we hadn’t watched Dany change over the course of 8 seasons, her madness would be a retelling if her brother’s story, in that we feel no sympathy for the character and don’t understand that he was multi-dimensional.  In fact, the actress specifically mimicked her brother’s mannerisms and child-like excitement in her final scenes, bringing her character arc full circle.

The ending wasn’t bad.  Nor was the acting or directing, but we waited YEARS to see the outcome, and the lack of interest and effort by the writers really shows in the final season.  They dropped the ball and that can’t be made up for.  I mean, what was the whole point in the scene with Bronn confronting Tyrion and Jaime??  There was no point at all.  Why show Tyrion adjusting chairs?  Time was a very limited commodity in this last season, and it really shows how poorly it was used in the trivial things that were in focus.  This whole season was a giant “fuck you” from the writers, and that’s a shame considering how much effort was put into telling these characters’ stories.",I just wish they had shown us this. My problem is everything that happened that we didn’t see.,"I feel the same way about season 8 as I do the star wars prequel. I think that the bones of an amazing story are there that are really well put together and interesting and different. I just don't think it was executed very well. Senator plays both sides of a galactic war between robotic rebels and magic wielding warriors just to create an opportunity to seize power over the Galaxy? Fucking cool, let's tell it as a love story between a little boy and a Queen. Similar issue here. I think that everything you said is right on, and that many are asking for things that wouldn't have actually been better. I just think it was not done as well as it could have been. We just let it all play out when there were so many plotlines that we're left out that could have contributed and smoothed out this rough delivery.  Battle of Winterfell should have been better laid out tactically. Drogon should at least run out of fire at some point. Playing up bran as the night king or something like that could have made the ending so much more interesting. There's a fantastic story in there, even as currently delivered, and absolutely no flack should fall on cast or crew. They just should have taken more time to let it all play out.","I think you make a lot of valid points, and I agree that the ending itself, in terms of where all the characters ended up, was all right. The journey though, which some would argue is more important, was pretty messed up in the last couple of seasons.

One thing that does bug me is that people keep saying that someone who never wanted to rule might make the best king. Did we all forget about Robert? He never wanted to rule. He hated it. And he was not good at it either. Sure, there weren't too many wars on his watch. But he beggared the realm.","In spite of the dragons, the brutality, wars, assassinations, witchery, fantastical stuff etc. served as its backdrop, Game of Thrones is just a drama series with one clear protagonists, The Starks and antagonists, the Lannisters. The rest come as fillers for subplots that are carved into the whole main story. At the end of the day the protagonists will always triumph over their rivals. If we could live with that concept, we would enjoy the show, like I thoroughly did.","I agree 100%, last 2 seasons were hardly perfect, but the ending made sense to me. I’ll add one thing, Jon was Azor Ahai, the “flaming sword” used to banish evil ended up being Drogon. Just my view on it.","OP, I am way late to the party here, but I just wanted to thank you for articulating so beautifully what I have not been able to.","This post brought to you by today's sponsors, DnD",If you completely ignore everything from the first seven seasons and watch S8 as a badly written popcorn action flick then it is mildly tolerable.,"Thanks for the apologist fansplanation. 

None of what you discuss, however, changes the fact that without GRRM's dialogue and source material, this season was atrociously written and rushed.   

Contrary to that bullshit-just-read-Joseph-Campbell-for-the-first-time dialogue that sounds like the kind of nonsense you'd read on r/im14andthisisdeep/, there's plenty more powerful than a good story. 

In this case, it was bad writing that reared its ugly head and gave the series up to its flames.","I Agree 100%
I loved the story and the way (almost) everything turned out.
But the story telling was absolute shit that last season or 2.
I don't put all the fault on D&D though. They were complete newbies when the show started and they had a gang of talented and experienced people around them that could have helped. And GRRM himself is as much to blame for not having the material he promised, for the show to go off of.",*SUPPOSED to be as torn as she died,They should have just fired everyone and finished the last season with Muppets. They knew it was shite. The actors were ready to be done with it. The writers were already done and out of ideas. (Bollocksed it all up they did) And here this poor bastard is defending it.,"For the most part, i enjoyed it. Maybe some imperfections, but the story and characters was enough to keep me engaged, even with some of the rushed pacing","At one point I was like ""Am the only one who doesn't hate the ending?"" because there was so much hate for it, felt like needle in haystack, so thank you my friend for me proving me wrong. There were mistakes here and there but I also think that, it was the best ending.",Well said!  Not a perfect show but pretty close and so much fun over the years.,I'm not going to lie. I'm pretty salty about this whole situation but your brake down and explanation has made me take a step back and reanalyze everything. I guess I just had tunnel vision cause I was mad that Dany got killed. Thank you for taking the time to type this post.,"And don't forget for a moment that the huge tantrum started based EXACTLY on the plot points and where it ended up (thanks leakers). The crying took over the world before the final episodes  aired. Review bombings went backwards to other seasons and forward to episodes that hadn't even aired. Communities and subs swelled in ranks in the final week or two of the season.

The revisionist history from the hardcore haters is just covering for how embarrassing the emotional meltdown was. The NK didn't get a big flashy ending. No big sword fights for Jon. No pretty princess Dany. People were (and still are) trying to defend mass murder because they just loved strong lead Dany so much. No time travelling Bran episode (Deep down inside I would have loved this). Every single character didn't get a cheesy farewell to every other character they ever had a connection to.

OMG NOW WE HAVE TO APPLY THE GENEVA CONVENTION ONLY TO DANY. OH TURNING PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR LEADERS IS JUST AS BAD, etc etc. As those whines fell short, it just turned into nitpicking about how all of it just can't make sense. It does make sense. It's better than your fan fiction. The rest of us are a little down with how short it was. The magic of GRRMs character interactions and world building fell off because A) GRRM can't even come close to finishing his own series and B) World building takes a back seat to climactic finishes in almost every show and movie.

&#x200B;

I have plenty more on all these topics but this is lunch and I'm on a cell phone.

TL:DR The haters are whiny overreacting cunts backpedaling to find better reasons for their despair and anger. Reasonable people can see a lot of the flaws in the last two seasons without it turning into an existential meltdown.",I feel like the frustration that has been sticking around the longest for me has been the conversation between Jon and Tyrion. I don’t see why Tyrion had to convince him to kill her. To me this goes against Jon’s whole character. He’s seen the things that she’s done and who she is becoming— he knows the right thing. Yet he’s still stuck on the whole “but she’s my queen” thing. Completely stomped on the integrity of his character.,I agree 100%,"There was a great post in the asoiaf subreddit that explained a lot. Gist of it was that it felt rushed and not make some sense was because a lot of the details were magic based that is not really translatable onto screen. The books thus far explain the warging abilities a lot better and its capabilities but harder to show on screen which allows those who’ve read the books to understand Bran’s scenes a lot better and what’s actually going on.

He has power by default and the least people can do is listen.

Tyrion resigned. And he was then being tried for treason. So he was not the Hand at the time of death, and as far as Dany is concerned, he wasn't even trustworthy.

So why exactly would Dany's army commander entertain his views?

As for the rest of your post, sure, a lot of the storyline *should've* made sense, but none of what you said had the intended effect on the author because it was rushed and put together sloppily.

I don't mind Bran being king, I don't mind Arya not getting to deliver a killshot to Cersei, I don't mind Dany going loco, what I *do* mind is how we were led to all of that with one foot out the door. I feel like I just watched a half finished product, the SparkNotes version of a show that had been sprawling and well told (at the very least, relative to the last 2.5 seasons).

I will also probably never be ok with how little we know about the Night King. His whole posse was useless, nothing about the Craster babies was ever revisited, I dunno, there's just a lot of meat on that bone. Same beef I have about the rest of the ending I guess, that one just bothers me the most.

OP did address this at the beginning but I think the point they're missing is that without that one *glaring* issue of the hurriedness and carelessness that the series wrapped up with, a lot of these perceived (in my opinion, actual) flaws are probably softened or entirely done away with.

By the end of this season, many people were left with more questions than answers and that's a major problem unless you're setting something else up which is off the table at this point. I've seriously never seen such a strong consensus on what exactly went wrong with a piece of media before. Most of the time when something is unsatisfying it's for a whole host of reasons, it's just nebulously ""bad"" or at least divisive. With Thrones *everyone* seems to have the same specific complaint, sort of just brushing by that with a nod of understanding and commiseration to do a deeper dive on more specific scenes is missing the forest for the trees.","I mean, there have been a *fuckton* of people complaining not just about the storytelling, but the ending itself.

I fucking love the show. The show has been a part of my life for eight years. I’ve sunk countless hours into reading the book series ~three times, in addition to rewatching the show. 

Usually when people are passionate about something they’re going to express happiness or sadness over how that thing develops and continues to change over time. I can absolutely love the show and still be disappointed that the writing took such a stark turn after season four. I can criticize how the show ended because I’ve been so focused on the entire buildup to that moment. 

Criticizing something doesn’t mean you don’t like it; it means you expected more from it. I am extremely happy I was able to be alive at the same time game of thrones was released as a tv show, and I’m not *mad* at how it ended; I just wish the quality had stayed consistent until the end, that’s a very reasonable expectation.",Lot of viewers apparently prefer to be spoonfed.,"Again - missing the point. I’m not in any way trying to say that you couldn’t easily wrap the story up and make it seem to yourself that it makes sense. The thing is that the distribution of time and overall emphasis were illogical. The writers should’ve been aware that e.g. having the Long Night play out somewhere mid-season would completely undermine its impact on the story. In addition to that, I think that Drogon destroying King’s Landing took approximately the same amount of time and it wasn’t even that necessary. Now I’m just speaking my mind and I’m not saying that my opinion is necessarily correct, but in my view - showing off all the CGI was a tactical move for the writers to lessen their own workload.
Creating art is always a two-way street and the reception plays an important role just like the creation itself.
I loved these characters like they were my own but in the end I felt nothing. Is it because I have no sense of logic and deduction? Perhaps, but I doubt it. It simply didn’t feel natural enough for a cathartic reaction that we had all expected. Hence the discontent, hence the outcry.","Dany grew up fleeing from people that would have brutally murdered her.  She was a tool and a pawn, and sold off to Drogo, where she learned to be ruthless and speak with authority.  The Dothraki didn’t listen to her until she asserted dominance over them.  And when they all abandoned her because Drogo was injured, she was told it was because they followed power.  The slaver that she bought the Unsullied from didn’t take her seriously because she was a woman.  Nor did the slavers in Mereen, or the Khalasar.  In each instance she only came out on top because she asserted every ounce of dominance she had.

The seven kingdoms was an entirely different culture.  Power isn’t given to the strongest there, it’s given to those who call in favors.  Where Dany was from, executing prisoners quickly was a gift, because the alternative was slavery or torture.  Nothing she did before burning King’s Landing indicated madness, she was just following the customs she’d been taught.  In her experience, showing mercy had always caused problems later.  Executing the Tarly’s was not out of the ordinary by any means.  

The sparks of madness only appeared in late last season, when she met Jon, where she let her jealousy take hold.  That was disappointing because we are to believe that it was because Jon leaving her, when the relationship was so rushed it wasn’t at all believable.

I don’t mind the Tyrion/ chair scene, because as you said, it shows his eagerness to be serious and do everything right, which was then completely destroyed by the humorless-sitcom like banter about the practicality of whore houses.

The scene with Bronn confronting Jaime and Tyrion had no value whatsoever to the plot.  It wouldn’t have been weird to see him next in the council room.  That time could have been so much better spent by showing Dany’s sanity crumbling, or Jaime oscillating between Briene and Cersi, or Jon and Dany interacting, or Sanasa and Arya’s reaction to learning Jon was never their brother.  But, nope, instead we got Bronn being uncharacteristically thick-witted by blackmailing Jaime and Tyrion.","Yes, but she said he’d been kind when they were younger.  She even reflected back on the scene with the horse/ rape in horror, indicating that this was out of character for him.  He became more and more erratic as he got older and more obsessive about the throne.  What kind of sane person says that to his little sister?  His only emotions were self righteousness and jealousy, just as Dany was in the end.  It was all very “the ends justify the means” for both of them.  I think if Viserys has always been as unstable as he was he died, he couldn’t possibly made it as far as he did.

If we hadn’t seen Dany’s character develop so much over 8 seasons, she also would have been a very one dimensional villain.  Many people are upset that Dany’s character arc was destroyed by how she ended up, but I think her insanity was inevitable and that the actress behaving just as Viserys had brought her arc to a satisfying close.  I wish there had been more progression, instead of just flipping a switch from “sane” to “insane”.  When I first heard the “mad queen” theories I wanted it to not be true, because I *did* like Dany’s character so much, but now that I’ve seen the ending I can’t imagine it ending any other way.

I would argue that Ramsay was also insane.  His cold disinterest was sociopathic/ psychopathic.  By today’s standards he would likely be a high IQ serial killer.  That’s what makes him SO evil.  The lack of emotion and empathy.

Joffrey was just an entitled little douche bag.","I can't speak on his exact quotation, but ik when the show was pitched to him, GRRM thought he'd be much further in his writing process by this time. He thought (and stated) he'd be done with the books years ago. I'm sure the plan was for the show and the books to be wrapping up at about the same time.
It is his fault because he owns the story and agreed to hand it off to TV producers when he clearly needed more time and less distraction to get the story where it needed to be.","* Wights can sometimes break through stone tombs, other times they're easily stopped by a wooden door.

In really any well written story every scene and every bit of dialogue should be realistic, make well explained sense and have a specific point as to why it happened pertaining to the conclusion of the story.
Some examples off the top of my dome:
For starters there's a graph floating around showing this season had by far the least amount of words per minute of any season. Big Red flag. 
It appears that a majority of the dothraki are killed by whites. Only a few run back. But several hundreds show up mounted on horses in kings landing. And why did they charge alone in the first place? 
How did beric block all those whites, getting stabbed and bitten all those times and end up running through the door 20 feet ahead?
The night king could have easily killed Jon snow but chose not to.. OK. But then he gets swarmed by thousands of whites all on him and magically next scene there's none around him and he's fighting them 1 at a time.  
Same with theon at the godswood. There's a whole army of them that wiped out all the dothraki yet 16 archers can pick em off 1 by 1 and they stop just in time for 2 main characters to get special scenes? 
And the story says arya leaps off a pile of dead bodies. But where was it? 
How tf did Bronn get past the thousands at winterfell with a crossbow into a room with 2 of the most important people in the country? And how did he reload that bow so fast? And what was the point of that scene anyway? There was none. 
How did Dany on a dragon not see the largest fleet of ships in the world? How did euron hit a dragon 3 times in a row from so far when no one could hit the other dragon when it was flying right at them? 
Jamie completely abandoned his arc of redemption at the very end.. OK. But when tyrion finds them burried in rubble under the red keep, there was clean floor 30 feet away from the bodies. Jamie and cersi could have taken 10 steps to the side and survived. 
Arya tries to help but as she is running through crowds of hundreds of people, suddenly everyone around her dies. Except a random white horse. Uninjured, clean, and calm. She gets on and rides off. How? Why? Her arc was done. She at the very least could have just continued running and the outcome would be the same. 
How come after Jon sees grey worm beheading pow's he immediately goes to find the queen; and even though Grey worm had several more throats to cut, hes magically in formation protecting Dany by the time Jon gets there?
Where tf was dorne this whole time? 
What tf was all the build up of the gold cloaks and the elephants? 

There's more examples if you watch through again. And yes ik there are ways to explain all these plot holes away but it doesn't make it right. I have no problem with the way anything ended up.

In theory it could be a great plot point. But it was executed so poorly that it doesn't matter if that's what GRRM intended or if it was a good idea in theory. Within the context of the show that we were given, Dany's story line ended terribly. It didn't make sense. It was not set up well. It was rushed and poorly written. Because it wasn't done right, the theoretical greatness of that idea doesn't matter, the end result is that it was a bad plot point. Same goes for nearly every issue that people have been complaining about. Arya killing the Night King and the whole White Walker plot point being a fairly easy foe is not terrible in itself, and with the right set up and storytelling, it could work, but it was terrible in context of everything that came before it. The way it was done makes it bad.","M’Lady, *tips fedora* /s","This seems disingenuous to me.

How do you deal with ramifications of the NK being defeated if NK death is last episode. You're basically asking for another season if youre insisting in NK's defeat being last episode. 

Drogon destroying King's Landing was to make Dany's decision to turn heel more acceptable. We had been shielded from seeing Dany's victims perspective, hence why a large number of people didnt think it was believable, but she randomly crucified 100 slavers, pulled a pretty Lannister-y double-cross when she ""trades"" Drogon for the Unsullied, or when she chose to kill random sons of mereen. She has shown a tendency to think in black-white terms, and it was  frequently the counsel of more level-headed characters that allowed her to see more shades of gray. And her obsession with everyone bending the knee was developed in parallel with her falling in love with Jon Snow. This did not happen over the course of 3 episodes, but we were distracted with Jonarys when it was happening. 

When Mad Queen first happened, i thought it was underdeveloped, but i thought it was pretty clear in next episode when they showed the courtyard full of Dothraki/Unsullied, that she had rightly inferred that she lacked the political support in Westeros to accomplish the regime change she envisioned, and she resorted to the same approach she always had: bend the knee or die.  So part of it was an emotional outburst/rage, but i think a big part of it was cold political calculation. Her typical approach of play savior, have everyone love you, be given free reign to dictate terms clearly failed this time around due to popularity of jon snow, arya. I personally think the emotional instability part of losing Jorah/Missandei weakened the character arc, or at best distracted from the truer motivation. It has creeped me the fuck out since she first started calling the dragons her children. The Starks have as close a relationship with their direwolves as Dany does with her dragons, and not one of them refers to them as their children/siblings. Dany has always inspired mixed feelings in me. As has Arya to be honest, but she sorted it out, Dany didnt. Each character has a number of other characters you can try to draw parallels with, and you come away with interesting observations of those characters. I think Dany comparing to Stannis for ""I deserve the throne"" and Arya for ""vengeance is mine,"" tyrion/varys for ""we can make a better world,"" and the Lannisters/Tyrells/anyone in Westeros for ""politics are always cutthroat,"" give the fullest picture of her. Like Stannis, her belief in her destiny drove her to commit pretty terrible atrocities. Her desire for vengeance was less consuming than arya's, and indeed, arya was the more death-obsessed one until she reunites with her family, achieves broad recognition as savior of westeros, two things Dany is denied _despite_ having contributed far more to the war effort. Hell, i subscribe to the Dany was a victim of Sansa's/the North's distrust as much as her own internal characteristics. I dont believe Dany goes Mad Queen if anyone in Westeros shows her a modicum of appreciation for saving everyone's asses, the people of Westeros _are_ different than those in Essos, and i think that plays a huge role. Ultimately, it's her sense of entitlement- a trait best demonstrated by cersei- that leads her to burn down king's landing the way that cersei blows up the sept. Like Cersei, she vowed numerous times to destroy anyone that got in the way of her attaining power. The difference is the Lannisters have insight into the fact they are selfinterested elitist assholes- and paradoxically- this awareness redeems their psychological state. But Dany isnt really a monster, is she? She has a compassion for the common person that Cersei distinctly lacks, and her inability to balance her ruthless ambition with her kind heart is why she gets twisted. She needs to be a good person in her own eyes (while Lannisters have numerous times described themselves as monsters), and so she develops what is ultimately a shallow rationalization that she is doing what she's doing to ""save everyone."" This lie she believes herself is why she is both a genuinely kind person and also a horrible monster. 

The reason Dany as a villain works is because the viewer also believes in her pre-ordained destiny as savior, accomplished almost entirely by the music that plays whenever she was destroying her enemies. Dany is an amazing character, far from thinking her character arc was ruined by season 8, i think she's one of the most complex female characters ever written. 


Anyway, despite everything, i am mostly sympathetic to the complaints people have, it's just that those things didnt keep me from loving it. Ive rewatched season 8 episodes at a much higher rate than i have prior seasons, i honestly loved it


Im sorry you felt nothing. I cried for Cersei/Jamie, Jon having to kill Dany, the Hound dadding Arya. And full blown wept for Theon, Jorah, Lyanna. I wept for Brienne preserving Jamie's legacy. These are all complex, flawed characters, and attempts to ""find a moral""/ message are doomed to be unsatisfying.  I am more than okay connecting the dots myself, the fans have demonstrated for more than 8 years ability to generate hypotheses/theories that are frankly as entertaining as the show itself. I dont know why suddenly we as a community have lost that ability entirely; we could piece together Mad Queen was going to happen, R+ L = J, but we cant fathom that Euron was hiding behind a fucking tall cliff. 

There are lots of loose ends, and Dany's saga is over, but like, you know theyre making more spinoff shows, books, you dont think theyre going to be addressed?","That might be true.

I agree with a lot you wrote but Gilly and lil Sam are there with Sam saying goodbye to Jon and when he hugs her he notices she's pregnant. They're also seen surviving the battle of Winterfell/The Long Night in the crypt after the NK dies. 

You forgot Varys' plot to poison Dany was vaguely mentioned but we're supposed to guess that's what his plan was. Also forgot Dany mean muggin' Jon when she leaves from her big Hitler speech at her army but later greets him with sparkly eyes just before he kills her.

Much like stannis' claim which ned tried to make happen.,"I've always been unsure if legally Cersei would be queen in that situation, or if, just because all her rivals are dead and she was holding control, she just took the power and made herself queen. I always assumed the latter. In which case, combined with how unpopular she had been with the populace, she probably would have been viewed after the fact as an illegitimate queen?","I... I feel like that's exactly what I said with the ""story points good, storytelling bad"" thing.",there was a lot more to the ending than simply dany going mad.,"I personally agree with many points you made and I don’t argue the fact that they are all valid when it comes to the story itself. But what I’m pointing my finger at is the fact that this season turned into all-action when the rest of the show focused more on premeditation and the circumstances that drove certain characters to do what they thought was right or necessary. The second episode of the season was, to my mind, the last that featured any nicely executed dialogue which used to be abundant in the beginning of the show. I loved the point of view when Drogon burned down King’s Landing, I simply thought it to be unnecessary to take up so much time, especially when there could’ve been many other scenes that would’ve kept the storyline going by showing some characters’ lucid thoughts. If it weren’t for beautiful shots and incredible acting, most of the scenes that weren’t completely action-related would’ve been too cringey to even watch. 
Heck, they even had to use devices as old as time to give out a sense of finished story, including Tyrion (almost) breaking the fourth wall whilst talking to Jon, Samwell and ASOIAF and that awkward time-skip during which everything got magically wrapped up and fixed.  
Yeah, Dany always had a unique sense of justice, but it still is too huge a leap even for her to snap and kill the innocents after losing a good portion of her army to defend them just because she didn’t feel loved. I’m not saying it’s not enough of a motivation - it damn sure is - but it would’ve made more sense if those who actually took part in it were primarily affected, not the random innocents. I hoped to see her try to reign justly but face obstacles every step of the way because, let’s face it, peace doesn’t last (as Olenna perfectly said it in her soliloquy) and the people of Westeros would always see her as a foreign invader. That would’ve been a valid turning point for her since they would no longer be so innocent in her eyes. So much of it was left out that would’ve made the show beautiful and relatable on many levels when it comes to contemporary history. 
Each family represented a certain point of view, and their views were portrayed in that manner that however foregrounded, they had to be modified because they no longer proved to work. Some individual stories had a happy ending, some didn’t, just like it was meant to happen, but the simplicity which prevailed made me not buy it. Otherwise the philosophy, though cynical and nihilist, is pretty simple - cross the line, evolve and ascend, stay blindsided by your beliefs and they’ll crumble upon you. 
Also, we as a community would be able to fathom Euron’s fleet ambushing and taking down Rhaegal if it hadn’t been till last season that we were even faced with the mortality of fully grown dragons. Yeah, they’re not indestructible, they do get hurt, but the only time before that that a dragon was actually killed with one perfect shot was when the NK took Viserion down. But that was different, we had to consider all the magic going around the NK and White Walkers and his supernatural strength. And there wasn’t one time that Euron (only speaking about the show Euron, I’m aware of all the differences in the book) was actually portrayed as someone with that kind of aptitude. Of course, we can say that anything should be expected (this is a dragon show ffs), but that particular act doesn’t exactly follow any principle of coherence, IMO. 
We could go on pointing out the plot holes which were numerous, making jokes about Tyrion’s cock references and memes about Starbucks cups, but when the dust has settled, we will all eventually come to terms with the show the way it is and hopefully continue to address the main ideas and motifs that were the ones to make it great in the first place.",Hell no. I'm the worst procrastinator. But I never got paid dick to write either. But I do always keep my word to the people signing my checks.,">Gilly and lil Sam are there with Sam saying goodbye to Jon and when he hugs her he notices she's pregnant. They're also seen surviving the battle of Winterfell/The Long Night in the crypt after the NK dies.

Fair enough, I guess I kinda forgot those things happened.",Lol cheeky,Ok. That gets messy but I can see your point.,"But in the end the story points weren't actually good. Had they been handled differently, I supposed they  could have been good, buy what we were given were bad story points.","> I hoped to see her try to reign justly but face obstacles every step of the way because, let’s face it, peace doesn’t last (as Olenna perfectly said it in her soliloquy) and the people of Westeros would always see her as a foreign invader.

For me this already happened when she was queen in the east and she was facing obstacles (sons of the harpy for example).  there is one episode that I don't remember which, when someone says se ""is a conqueror"". When she was in Meereen she didn't want to sit and rule, she wanted to conquer more places and ""free the slaves"". she said at the end when they got kind's landing, she was going to other places to ""liberate people from tyranny"" or burn them all if they don't accept her as queen (what for me is tyranny too).",hodor,"Flaying people alive doesn't change your opinion of the Boltons, but rape does?

You have an odd scale of morality.","It is an uncomfortable scene no doubt, but I do feel 509 is much, much worse. ","I was shocked we didn't see much of it, and that Theon wasn't directly involved. Didn't think D&D would be timid about it ","How does that rape scene, between a husband and wife, compare to Daenerys' scene from season 1? 
",I'm assuming you are talking about the rape scene... I think Alfie Allen's   performance makes the scene worth watching.   ,she was a newly married bride who simply consumated her marriage... how is that bad? Boltons do much worse on a regular basis,[Problem solved!](http://i.imgur.com/VrNRJmO.jpg),deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.3622  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/75996),"I know this doesn't answer your question, but you should probably consider skipping all the violence too if you're worries kids might see it.

Therefore, you probably shouldn't be watching Game of Thrones in public.","I'm at work, and so I can't verify, but I'd bet Mr. Skin will have that information.",The violence in game of thrones isn't so bad though.   ,I guess not in Season 1. The latter half of series 3 onwards though...,she's hot... i got nothing else,Try linking to a website that doesn't require me to answer a survey to ready it. ,AFAIK the reason Drogon wasn't imprisoned is because he flew away (before he could be locked up) and didn't come back until this season.,"I'm sort of upset by the show's treatment of the other two dragons as well.

I usually don't like underdog stories, simply because the concept is done to death as a story trope, but here it's unintentional and real. I really don't like Drogon and I want to see Viseron and Rhaegon kick some arse.

All throughout the show, from the moment the dragons hatched, Drogon has been the only one to be seen doing anything. Shots of Dany playing with the baby dragons, it was always Drogon. The other two were caged.

Drogon gets to raze Astapor. 

Dany nurses Drogon while the other two fight over food in the background. Drogon then steals the food. 

Drogon kills a bunch of livestock and children, the other two are locked away. Drogon roams free. Gets awesome flyover scene in Valyria. 

Drogon saves the day when Dany is in trouble. Other dragons aren't mentioned, conveniently locked away.


It's kinda just annoying. I get that he's the alpha dragon; the biggest and strongest. So I understand that's the reason he got to wreck Astapor. I get that they focus on him to develop character.

But dammit, I wanna see the other two! They got to burn that guy, but I'm pretty sure if Drogon was around they would have had him do that too. 

They really needed to show that all three dragons are a force to be reckoned with. Instead we get the cool red and black one and the two smaller ones who nobody cares about. ","She definitely has a special relationship with Drogon, he's Balerion ""The black dread"" reborn, but he's not locked up because he flew away before she locked the other two up. Honestly off the top of my head I can't even name the other two dragons. ","Dany is bound to Drogon now that she's ridden him. No dragonrider can ride more than one dragon. 

So place your bets, we have two dragons, and plenty of potential candidates who can be their riders.","Exactly, she would have locked up Drogon if he hadn't disappeared.","Also, I don't remember which episode, but she seems to feel bad for locking up the dragons and visits them. They are *pissed*. Dany seems to be trying to mend fences by giving them sacrifices, but I don't think anyone would be able to free those two before dying at this point.",Viseron and Rhaegon,"they are really mad at her but at the point when they are released, dragon will whip their asses for her. good thing he ran away.","ok, lets kill the 'female dog'!",Har! The one thing G.R.R. Martin gets right are all of the characters' deaths.,You spelled Ragger wrong,"We know that the Night King is someone who was turned into a White Walker by the children in order to fight against the first men in the sixth season. We also know that White Walkers can be killed by dragon glass and or Valyrian steel. Sam kills a White Walker using dragon glass in like the third or fourth season so it's been proven that it's not only Jon who can do it. So I really don't think Rhaegar is the Night King. I think that maybe Rhaegar's death may not be as simple as Robert killing him, but I doubt that he's the Night King.",Nah. The Night King is ancient. How would his body get there?,Anythings Possible! ,This would all require for the story of Ruby Ford to be a lie made up by Robert to save face. I dig it!,"Rhaegar had two other children with a martell. So he was already a father but  I don't think he had any interest in being a father, he wanted to be the prince that was promised and when he knew he wasn't he decided one of his children must be",Only Jon can kill the Night King. I am not talking about othet whitewalkers. They can be killed by dragonglass but I am not sure if it's the same with night king.,But the Night king wasn't the first whitewalker. People didn't see them for many years but that foes not mean that they were not alive.,"It strengths my theory even more.
Also, I would like to draw your attention to his lady love Lyanna who was the main reason to fight with the Baratheons and not just the throne 
",Yeah... No,He writes 'rightful heir' because Joffrey is not Robert's son. Rhaegar Targaryen is Jon's father. Why would they keep Jon away from Robert if he was his son with the woman he truly loved? ,HBO released an info-graph that confirmed Jon snow was Rhaegars son ,"Also he writes rightful heir not for Jon snow but for stannis, the there is scene with renly where Ned says stannis is the rightful king since Cersies children were bastards",\* **Lyanna**,"Jon would have still been a bastard, even if he was Robert's. Robert and Ned still thought Joffrey and Tommin were Robert's when Jon was sent to the wall.","Cersei's children are not bastards, since they were born within the structure of a legitimate marriage. They are not Robert Baratheon's true-born children, a fact that Ned becomes aware of, but it's not the same thing. Legally they are still legitimate children.

Similarly, Rhaegar and Lyanna's child remains a bastard whether it was a love affair or an abduction/rape - the main difference being whether Lyanna is motivated to want to protect the child or not. Her asking Ned for help (which he gives) leans toward the idea that she had gone with Rhaegar consensually, but it doesn't give their baby any legal legitimacy. The only thing that would do that is if she and Rhaegar had actually gotten married. There's some indication that the Targaryans were not against polygamous marriage, so the possibility probably exists, but I don't think we have enough information to argue strongly one way or the other.",Jon was born years before Joffrey and Tommin. Why would Ned have kept Robert's newborn from him?  ,"Robert wouldn't kill him as Lyanna says he would if he found out about him. 

HBO confirmed that Jon is Rhaegar's son.",Wasn't Daario a member of the second sons for years? Long enough to become a trusted lieutenant. So if he really is someone else it shows incredible foresight. The kind of foresight to not leave all your ships unattended during your coronation...,Daario/Victarion does not have any ships. His brother Euron does though. He sent Victarion to scout out Dany and earn her trust so he prolly joined the second sons after hearing about Danys dragons and conquering of Qarth. Daario is just a puppet to Euron in my theory. In the books Victarion sails to meet Dany first. I'm just giving a theory about what D&D may do with the character. Everyone theorizes that Daario is the leader of the harpies but I just don't see the connection. This connection I've made makes sense though. Euron I believe is the leader of the harpies and Daario/ Victarion is out scouting them,"But they haven't even alluded to the existence of Victarion on the show. What are they going to do, just have a big reveal like ""and he's my brother too!""?",[deleted],"But some scenes like that are extremely integral.

""Hey, why is that kid a cripple?""

""Huh, I don't know. He just is""",I wonder how the show airs in places like india,"There actually are some edits online where all nudity is cut off. When the scene is important, they put a black screen with, for example ""Bran sees a couple having sex"" written, or the screen freezes and the audio goes on. 

You just need to look for it","Strange that they don't take more issue with the ample headless bodies, bodiless heads, flayed corpses etc.","What happened to pycelle?

 Beats me, hes just gone


Or


What happened to theon? He just seems really sad lately

",[deleted],"As someone from India, HBO is actually very good at cropping and making scenes viewable. They don't necessarily beep words, and sex and incest and very easy to interpret. Indian authorities aren't as prudish as you think. The only thing is implying sex is fine as long as no nudity is shown and a few words (though HBO nevertheless doesn't beep them). I think that it should be like that as you can literally go to any channel while channel surfing and HBO is not an add on as it is in the US. Of course, that's why there is a huge percentage that pirates the show...",[deleted],"I don't believe so, but you said ""sex"", not nudity. You still see Cersei getting railed from behind by Jaime","I thought got airs on the premium HBO Defined,  not the regular hbo in india","Im obviously joking. 




Ooooo i thought of another one. 


""What happened with Jon?"" 

""I dunno but he has a certain swagger about him, like somethings changed about him""



","That premium is still not an add on like HBO in the USA and has no parental warning views as that's how Indian TV is structured. Having parental warnings is optional for channel owners and only in the case of UA movies (Indian equivalent of PG13) are you supposed to show a UA warning watermark. Unfortunately (or fortunately depending how you see it), India has no Television certifying authority, although there are some rules to be followed.",My understanding was that HBO Defined was commercial free and cost 99 rupees a month.,Yes but it still follows Indian TV norms. ,"I find it hard to imagine Arya and Sansa ever meeting up (feels like GRRM won't allow it), but why would they turn back? The place should still be safe for Arya given their position (and a potential small reward assuming *anyone* cared about the aunt), unless they think a Lannister insider killed her or something?

I really want the sisters to reunite though...

edit: Also the Hound revealed Arya's real identity to the guard, it would be strange for them to simply walk out and leave afterwards.","I'm guessing they'll turn back around and Arya will go to Essos because in Season 3 (I think) the faceless man gave her a coin and told her to go to Pentos (I think) and give it to someone there and to say ""Valar Morghulis"" if she needed him (Which I think now she does if she wants to start with her list). This is all speculation of course, it may or may not be true, I didn't read the books. (well only the first 50 or so pages of the first one)","They didn't show anything after her little outburst at the bloody gate.  Not sure when the show will get back to them, or whats next, I doubt they would continue to the eryie.","They haven't shown anything, but I'm sure in episode 10 we'll see some closure",Maybe the hound plans on taking her to the Tullys now? Though not sure who is going to pay for her there. ,"It was a little unclear, to me, exactly where they were, however. They could have been right at Lyssa's doorstep, or they could have been at a much further roff wall, or even merely at the border of their land. There could still be days of walking to go, so why WOULD they bother, if they thought Lyssa was dead?","Littlefinger,Sansa and Robyn are on a ""Goodwill"" tour, right? Seems they left maybe a day, or half a day before The Hound and Ayra showed up...so who knows? I want to see if the Hound's wound is a red herring or a death sentence though.","Maybe Arya will escape the Hound and head to Bravos now. That infection is getting worse, it would give her the opportunity to. ","If we have another near miss between Stark siblings, I'm going to strangle a kitten.","This. I thought it would be bizarre for them to just turn around. Makes sense to proceed. Would like to see them together, even briefly, but I think George may have other plans. Just seems weird to have them go 'oh, aunts dead? Well, guess we better turn around.'  especially because there's no where obvious or close for them to go. (kin, etc) ",Braavos.  She was to give the coin to any braavosi and say valar morghulis! ,"Maybe she meets a guy that will sail her from the Vale right across

I forgot about the faceless man, and thought he was a Deux ex Machina to get out of Harrenhall, silly me.

","And Brienne is out there, looking for Sansa. Maybe she finds Arya, too. ","Fair enough, it is unclear how close to the castle they were. I assumed they were close, near the gates/etc.  The way it's playing it, put seems clear either they weren't close, or had missed Sansa/little finger by a couple of days. ","Escape him, or kill him?","Easy there, Joffrey","I'm sure Arya and the Hound will stay, but they're at that gate and Sansa/Littlefinger/Lord of the Vale are leaving and they might not go the same way.

Still, I think it would be dumb for them not to see each other.",[removed],"Yeah, I even missed that Sansa/Littlefinger had left, till I read another comment here.","I don't see why she would. I know he's on the list, but they had their bonding moment: he was literally and figuratively without his armor. I don't Arya is too emotionally/mentally damaged to kill him after that.",She already is!,I am sure HBO would love to continue it but the writers have said they have told their story.  They've been saying it for awhile.  ,"i think that the main problem is budget: HBO cannot devote its resources to a single show (although successful) for an infinite amount of time. They have (showbusiness rules) to move on to something new. Also, remember that for these final seasons they don't have a book to adapt, but they have to write an actual script. This takes time and money (and they already stretched the waiting time between seasons). ","GRRM didn't get conned. D&D got conned. They were adapting a book series to television. The source of the book series dried up and now they're forced to write original content based off some scribbled notes and a rough outline. The quality has dropped because the rich world and the back stories and the dialogue don't exist anymore. It's literally fan fiction now.

D&D have another show in the wings with HBO that they want to make and it's been delayed because GOT is taking so long to finish. 

Imagine dedicating 8-9 years of your life to a single project. Every day it's all you talk about. It's your whole life. 

I don't blame them for rushing the end. They want the project to be over, they're having to do more with less, and they are burdened with delivering on a hugely popular series with a hugely fickle fan base. Once it's done they can move on to then next thing.",Simple Math: Fast Travel < $30M,"

>It sucks to come to the realization that your favorite show is in the hands of con men. GRRM got conned!



Hope he is proud other people finish his story.
I gave up the show in season 5.",Why are they ending the show now? Ask Vince Gilligan. ,The problem is they have lots of story to tell but are running through it. The pace they are moving through the story compared to earlier seasons kinda shows they are just trying to get the series over with instead of tell the story in a consistent way.,"Another cost creep are the actors. The bigger the show becomes and the longer it goes on, the more actors will ask. Now perhaps this isn't a big deal on GoT since they have killed off a lot of characters, but I think by now we all know who the key players are that have true plot armor. Actors also may want to leave to pursue other projects, and if they leave, it can really screw up the writing. It's better to end a show while you can still reach a decent conclusion and leave the show in a good spot rather than scrapping to keep it going on and on and eventually losing your audience. 

Honestly I think the only people who're upset about GoT at the moment are hardcore fans and book fans. GoT has peak ratings right now because people want those big budget episodes. They want ice dragons and huge battles. The show might get a little watered down in its last act, but I think it will still be remembered fondly. This gives them the opportunity to do spinoffs and cash in on things like merchandise and the making money off of the streaming content out to HBO's and other (such as international) services for many years to come. ","Seems like apologist bullshit to me.

The first season didn't have over-the-top battle scenes, even in the midst of a war. The shift from political thriller to action-adventure is the reason that the budget has spun out of control - and this is directly in D&D's control. ","Hey so did GRRM. He IS the con man! Look at this buffoonery! ""Waaaah it's not what I want! I want GRRM's story""

Um, dumbasses, he never finished it! He gave away the ending to D&D because he is a con man failure who just wants your money! And he's getting it!

People are pissed at the wrong guy. Fucking Harry Potter / LOTR / Game of Thrones losers who want everything their way. 

Here, let's just end it like GRRM. Jon Snow dies after being betrayed and stabbed. THE END. 

Edit: Job to Jon. Fucking autocorrect.","I don't think you understood his post. It wasn't a question of why they are ending the show, it was a question of why they're rushing the ending. ",That is because they started out with source material. Now they are just writing glorified fan fiction. ,"Yes exactly. They can't match the talent of  GRRM so they are resorting to cgi and action. So much of season 7 makes no sense. Also they are sacrificing the story just so they can shoot cool looking action sequences. For example, in order for them to get an epic charge at Dany and Drogon by Jaime AND have Jaime survive, they need to have Bronn fly out of nowhere and then Bronn swims Jaime hundreds of yards away and not one of the thousand dothraki riders spots them or even bothers to look for them. And they don't drown. Or because they want a cool action shot of the dragon sinking into a lake it forces them to have to invent giant chains that somehow got attached to the dragon. Remember the zombies don't swim, so did a white walker scuba under? They put themselves in these bad situations where they have to defy logic just so they can create a situation that looks good on camera. It forces us as viewers to ignore the stupidity or makeup idiotic explanations to rationalize what we are watching. They think nobody will question in it or they think people are stupid. They are terrible writers.",Rushing?  They're taking 3 years to put out 13 episodes.  I don't think they're rushing to do anything.,George signs off on everything though I thought ,"Jesus christ, dude. How is it that so many people refuse to believe that the Night King likely knew there would be a dragon there, and that they probably brought chains with them? We've seen he has abilities at least similar to a greensight, why is it so implausible that he knows what's going to happen? There's still 6 episodes left, 12 hours worth of TV, and you've already decided it's nonsense. ","Nobody is talking about them rushing how much time has passed in the real world, they're talking about rushing the story. It could be 3 years or 10, or even 1, and it's still the same conversation.","He doesn't sign anything. He's a consultant but they don't have to run the scripts past him or anything.

They don't talk about it much, but I suspect the relationship between HBO and GRRM is pretty sour these days. They were relying on him to keep ahead (or at least pace) with the show but in all the years the show has been out, he hasn't released even one more book. I don't think they are very happy with him (and rightly so, IMO).",That's doesn't change the fact that they went from having 4 giant books of source material to general bullet points. ,"Looking closely at the chains, you can even see that they are made of ice.  Seems like just another power the Night King has which in fantasy tropes is really not that outrageous of a power!",So shouldn't we be asking ourselves why George would sign off on these points then? He obviously liked them which is why he approved them to script it that way ,"Yes, but my guess is the person who created this thread believes HBO is evil and GRRM can do no wrong.","I expected better...

**Edit**: The post is locked.","I don't care about the Starbucks cup, but I do think there are legitimate weak points that have yet to be explained on the show.  I think they're rushing it or the editing is a bit jarring and they're not showing some scenes that have been shot.  I could cite specific examples but I don't want to spoil anything.    


I will say I'm reserving final judgement until we see the finale and how all these parts finally fit together.  But I've already determined I'm going to be reading the books in hopes the ending is better than what I've already seen.","Nobody is criticising his acting, his costars acting, the work of the camera crew, choreographs, composers, directors and god know how many other hardworking people they have on the ground. It’s literally all directed at the writing","The only thing the fans are complaining about is the poor writing, everything else is fine. And the writing is poor, that’s a fact.","So he's basically saying ""I'm pissed that everyone will hate the show because of the writing, even though all of us did our best."" And he's right. Everyone on their team worked very hard and they did a good job. But unfortunately, all of their efforts are for nothing because of the bad writing. I feel sorry for them.","The fact that he wrote that before the season aired means he knew it sucked. He wasn't reacting to criticism, he was expecting it.","Maybe this is a little heavy handed, but if they ""care about the characters"" so much, why is everyone so OUT of character? It really does seem like fan service and if he says they're the biggest fans, then it's a little self-serving, isn't it?  Last - it begs the question:  If they did their best, why does it suck so much? And what were they doing up until this point?",We appreciate their acting and passion. Put the script and plot are chatastrophic to say at least. D&D are the only ones to blame really.,"That Kit Harrington interview is non-existent btw, the quote is made up. You are literally grasping at straws to justify shit writing.",[removed],"To be fair, Kit’s comment is just another example of bad writing.",[removed],[removed],Totally agree. Thanks for this post!,EXACTLY,[removed],Cue pointless internet debate in one...,"> Nobody is criticising his acting

I'm not so sure about that.  :)",[removed],"As I've said, I am holding final judgement until the finale, however, you're right there are some serious deus ex machina things going on.   We jump from being shipwrecked to standing outside the wall negotiating for who just got kidnapped.   It's a pacing issue, we just got used to the idea that someone got kidnapped, rather than wait for the rest of her army she's at the gate negotiating?  And why didn't Cersei immediately kill Tyrion while she had the chance?    


The ""monster"" she has blamed for her mother's death her entire life and hand to the ""usurper"" queen, she has a chance to take out but doesn't, instead only kill the assistant/translator to goad Dany.  It just doesn't fit the character in my opinion, the motives for hesitation are cloudy.  Only thing that would make that part fit for me is if Tyrion is in cahoots with Cersei because of their conversation back when she promised her army for the NK's fight.  Maybe she took his love of family talk to heart and they schemed something up together?  Otherwise I don't see why she let him walk away after that last scene confrontation.","Exactly. I was very determined to love the show when season 8 was aired and overlook any flaws because it was obvious how much work and dedication went in this. And I still love everything about it and appreciate all the work the cast and the crew has done.

I think the only bad writing part was the 20 good men fiasco and not portraying the hopelessness of Stannis's situation enough. He was 100% in character. Firstly, His men are FREEZING TO DEATH. They are starving, and now their food, supplies, equipment and horses are gone. They will die, destroy each other or desert. And what good is an army without numbers and morale that is through the floor. This is not storms end, this is the north, and they are at the mercy of that hideous cold. All of them are, including Shireen. 

Secondly, Stannis has SEEN Melissandre's magic and it produces results. He also BELIEVES that he is Azor Azai. shaky logic, but thats what he thinks. Lastly, he is the one king around who truly knows the enemy. The long night is coming and the dead with it, and while everyone's squabbling in the south he must prevail if he and the entirety of Westeros are to stand a chance. Therefore he must get his army out of this rut intact and he must win. He made a true sacrifice, and as a man and a father he will pay. However he made the choice only a man like Stannis can make.

Yeah though Sand Snakes were shit. Hopefully Doran can make the Dorne plotline worthwhile.","I haven't read any of the books so if the story deviates it is fine. But I will say the first few seasons had a much different feel to them. I guess it was because they had more book material to work with but yeah this season, some stuff has been pretty corny. Those sand snakes were horrible except for the jail scene of course. And Sam being saved by the Wolf was ridiculous, they could have come up with something better. It was too convenient.

Unless you're a college kid, this episode was simply not as good as the RW, Hardhome, Blackwater, or a few others.

Was it a great episode? Yes. Was it nearly Hollywood-blockbuster quality? Sure. Was it the best episode of GoT? Well, if you like action movies, perhaps. Thing is, some of us, including me, prefer dialogue-centric episodes with a minimum of violence or action. Some of us thought seasons 1 and 2 were phenomenal, and that the show has been going downhill ever since. Some of us thought that every single plot point in Battle of the Bastards was completely predictable, so there was absolutely no tension in the episode. Some of us think the show has become a cliche since season 3, with very little good characterization, a forced plot that doesn't develop naturally, a lack of interesting twists, and an extreme focus on violence and gore that's pointed towards college frat boys rather than mature, intelligent viewers.

As the other commenter in the thread said, yes, episode 9 had some great scenes. Visually, it was gorgeous. But there's a reason that I never go to movies anymore, and it's the same reason that I'd rate Battle of the Bastards around a 6/10. This season seemed so promising just a few episodes ago.","Yeah, me...

There are definitely some good things about this episode, but it was also a collection of so many typical Hollywood cliches (see list below) that it was a departure from everything I love about the GoT saga.

1. Evil, wicked bad guy (Ramsey) who's evil for the sake of being evil

2. Underdeveloped character (Rickon) with ties to protagonist killed, stirs protagonist to respond with violence

3. Epic battle, clash of swords/horsed/spears/shields, and ARROWS EVERYWHERE!!!  Since *Braveheart*, this has been the fantasy genre's version of the car chase scene.

4. Just when the hero looks to be at his lowest point, salvation arrives JUST IN TIME!!! (I literally threw popcorn at my screen and spilled my tequila when I say the Arryn sigil)

5. Protagonist (John) meets bad guy in a one-on-one duel, and wins

6. Bad guy gets his comeuppance, somehow related to his evil devices, scheme, modus operandi (Ramsey eaten by his own dogs)

And let's also look at the situation in Meereen, and how empty that was:

The Slaver attack crisis was averted and resolved in a matter of less than 60 seconds. The characters acquired NOTHING as a result of living through the crisis - no lessons, no personal growth, no character development. Usually events occur to propel the story of the characters and their personal journey, but in the case of this episode (and season), they're spectacle for the sake of spectacle. At the end of the battle in Meereen, Dany (as well as Tyrion, Grey Worm, Missandei) are entirely unchanged, unadvanced, and unaltered by the event. It's as if the battle served no purpose in the story.

I liked the intensity of the visual design of the episode, but when I was 5 years old I also thought it was wicked cool when Fonzie jumped over a shark on water skis.  ",What app is that?,i dont get it,"hahaha maybe they were having fun ""off-screen"" ;)",Yhea verily,"yes this is what i was thinking as well. The show is no longer showing the same vibe (main characters killing, unexpected brutal incidents, betrayals, etc...).. but nonetheless, the episode was a very well done one in terms of visuals as u said and terms of the outcome that any fan would wish for. But rating it as bad, would be unfair","yeah the best part of the battle for me was the close up on the charging horses. that was cool. all else, a bit ""meh"".","1. He's evil, yes, but that's nothing new. He's a psychopath who was raised by a sociopath. We've had irredeemable characters since the beginning. 

2. What else did you expect to happen? The only narrative possibility would be for Ramsey to kill him, and Jon's honour wouldn't allow him to do anything other than attack so he attacked. It's consistent writing for both characters.  

3. It's funny, the first word that comes to mind for me isn't epic, it's gritty. This wasn't glamorizing war, this was showing you just how fucked up and dirty it is. It's more Saving Private Ryan than Braveheart, with the exception of the weapons used. 

4. This is a departure from what you love? This happened at the battle for the wall and the battle of blackwater. It was heavily telegraphed in both those cases. Neither GRRM nor D&D have ever made an effort to avoid this trope. 

5. What duel? Ramsey got the piss beat out of him. There was no duel. 

6. Ironic deaths have been a thing throughout the entire series. 

As for Meereen, I think you missed the giant fleet of boats that Dany can sail on now? It wasn't a character development episode, it was the climax to 6 seasons of buildup for her. She's now in control of her dragons, she's in control of her armies, and she's wise enough to take counsel from Tyrion. Now she has what she needs to go to Westeros. 

At the end of the day this is a fantasy series. There will be spectacle. There will be payoff. It's a 3-act structure and we're entering the third act. Things will become more predictable. ","To be fair, Fonzie's jump was wicked cool - it was hokey, but still cool.

Yes actually. At least it would have been surprising and I wouldn't have been able to predict the outcome before the battle even started. On top of that it would have been far more realistic (yes, I know it's fantasy movie with dragons). Still, it was very hard to hold my suspension of disbelief this episode.

Remember when Rob Stark and friends got murdered at a wedding unexpectedly by soldiers (yes soldiers, not the antagonist himself) when everything looked like it was being built up to a giant Lannister-Stark battle? Or how about when Oberyn Martell got his skull crushed in after the audience was all sure that the Mountain was going to die. Or what about Ned Stark's unexpected execution?

The shocking twists and turns were what kept this series so entertaining. That's the Game of Thrones that I want back. This season has been comparatively pretty dull. Not very many ""good"" people have died recently. Almost everyone who's died has had it coming to them, and it's becoming predictable.","Okay let's just pretend the death of Eddard didn't draw us all in and differentiate this show... without deadly consequences of stupid mistakes and not winning battles with pure dumb luck, this is just another Hollywood fantasy show.

No, that's actually bad for me, thanks. It means I get to sit through a boring episode of a series that had been historically great.

Now to address your, ""Why bothering rooting for someone if you know they won't win."" argument. Firstly, you never know they won't when, hence the unpredictability. How many people that were alive the first season are still alive? I'm willing to bet around half of them or more, which is pretty much ideal since you have about a 50%+ shot of the character you'd like to succeed of succeeding. It's like watching a sports game.

Secondly, why bother rooting for someone if you know they *will* win? That's stupid and boring, and has been what's happening the past couple of seasons.

"" [s05E03](/s ""Calls Cersei out on excessive wine drinking, Calls Cersei mother, Proceeds to calls Cersei grandmother, Insults Cersei's age, Suggests she and Tommen are definately having sex, Reminds Cersei she isn't queen anymore"") ""

They're verbally attacking each other and it's not exactly subtle. And of course Cersei knows that Margaery is making fun of her. That last scene clearly showed Cersei walking away annoyed as laughter followed her.

Now I guess the question is if Cersei will stand for that and what she can / will do.
","Yes.

They both know very well that each despises the other.",Haha. Uhhh.. Yea.,umm... Are we watching the same show?,Do you guys think Ned is actually dead?,You are pretty much asking if we think she is stupid. It's pretty apparent.  It's the way royals do things. It's not in your benefit to outwardly be completely disrespectful,[removed],"Yeah right when Cersei came in and Margery said ""Mother!"" it was so cringey!","Umm, I might have missed something, but why is it a big deal that [S05E03] (/s ""Margaery and Tommen had sex"")? Why would Cersei be bothered by that?",Ned's dead baby....Ned's dead. ,Then she reminded her she'll probably be a grandmother soon. ,"Last season Cersei said something along the lines of ""If you ever call me mother again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep""","Cersei knows that it will be much easier for Margaery to control Tommen if she's boning him, and so it's kind of a symbol of Cersei losing her grip on things. It's all about the power struggle, basically. I remember back in Season 2 (I think) during the Battle of Blackwater, Cersei makes a comment to Sansa to the effect of ""the most powerful weapon you have is between your legs"" so she definitely knows what Margaery is up to.","[S05E03](/s ""Just because a parent knows their kid is having sex doesn't mean they want to hear about it, especially so openly. =P When Cersei walks into the area the girls are laughing about her son. At 2:11 in that clip you can see Cersei freeze up about the topic and then say goodbye abruptly. I'd say Cersei either disliked it because she found Margaery talking about it like that rude or because the girls had been laughing about Tommen. Or it's just the grandma comment. edit: It could have even been that she found the thought of them having sex annoying because she can't stand the thought of Margaery having her grandkid.  The only thing that's sure is she wasn't amused."")",That line was about calling her sister. Now she calls Cersei mother... Or soon to be grandmother. Lol,"Exactly. Margaery is basically a younger, less sadistic (but no less manipulative) version of Cersei and worse, Cersei knows it. As you said, while Cersei may not want to hear about M+T doing the dirty, her anger is not caused by hearing about it, but by the fact it's happening. She knows that as it continues Tommen will begin to fall under Margaery's control and she senses that Margaery is smart enough to sieze the opportunity.

Also, just think about real life monster-in-laws (I really want to say this in a way that removes any insinuation of sexism but I fear it's not going to sound good).  Mom's want the best for their sons-in most cases-and when they see a bad influence or what they perceive as one (Cersei sees Margaery wresting away control of not only her only surviving son, but the Seven Kingdoms as well), they will do what they can to drive a wedge between the 2",Thanks! This makes it much more clear to me!,I don't think Margaery would be talking about her 'sex life' with her friends. But... then again.,"Ah, right. The same level of insult, though","She was... That's what the scene opened up with.

http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-feed/2015/04/game-of-thrones-season-5-episode-3.html

"" [S05E03](/s ""The morning after their wedding night, she was telling all her friends at a Sex and the City style brunch how he wanted to break the Westeros boning record (they currently stand at four). She rubbed how exhausted she was from all the sex in Cersei's face, who's now scared shitless that she'll be sent away due to Queen Margaery's manipulative loins. And rightly so, Margaery knows how to play a dude. "") ""","Ah, thanks.",Cringe,That's nice but so hard to believe.,"> Similarly, if the Baratheons died out, legally and politically speaking, you couldn't simply hand the Iron Throne back to Daenerys

Robert Baratheon took the Iron Throne by force. He was a usurper. The rightful King or Queen of the Seven Kingdoms by right has __always__ been Viserys, and after his death Daenerys.

So... I mean this article likes to think it's crazy inciteful, but they're not stating anything that's not already been known since Season 1...","Anyone can claim the throne by right of conquest.  The only way to get it back at that point is also by conquest.

I found it interesting that by the laws of succession Jaime is heir to Tommen.
","Well I don't think the show ever mentions it, but the Baratheon claim was actually  legitimised due to them being descendents of Targaryens.","> Anyone can claim the throne by right of conquest.

This is _entirely_ my point...however, the article speaks of heir apparent as if it's something new. The rightful Queen or King has always been a Targaryen--even with a Baratheon on the Iron Throne.","You ignored the second part of my comment.

> The only way to get it back at that point is also by conquest.

The Targaryens only ruled because they conquered, you could take it a step back farther and say that the Targaryens invaders never had a right to rule and the Baratheon's overthrew the illegitimate foreign invaders in a righteous rebellion.

The article is about the laws of succession, if you want to read an article about how King Robert wasn't the rightful king then go find one.  But don't tear apart the article for being about a topic other than what you want it to be about.","> The Targaryens only ruled because they conquered

The Targaryens conquered Westeros almost 300 years ago (297 to be exact). Robert reigned for 17 years. It's not even an appropriate comparison--especially considering Aegon's conquest combined the 7 kingdoms into one. There __is__ no heir apparent besides a Targaryen for Westeros. As there are still living Targaryens--the crown is rightfully theirs. I'm not implying that conquest invalidates rights to the throne, but considering there are no more full blooded Baratheons, the right of succession would revert to the previous house (who still has heirs) who held the throne before the previous King.","yes but at the current time, nobody in westeros knows Daenerys is alive other than the elite, and they wouldn't let the people know about it, because her claim is actually better than that of whoever sits on the iron throne, and the people (assumably) would immediately support her. ","I'm sure the simple people at the very least have rumours of Daenerys being alive and even of her having dragons. 

I'm confident of this, because of how the elite get their information - from the ""birds"", Varys's and Cersei's dude's street children. 

So, the street children know and they are most certainly going to let other regular folks know, too. 

What the regular people make of it is anyone's guess, but likely they do not care much.",[deleted],"I am referring to the show, of course. This sub is *supposed* to be completely ignorant of the books. 

Unfortunately, every season more and more people infiltrate this sub who are unaware of the fact and bring in their book insights.

Now that the show is caught up to the books, consider all threads to be speculation.

I wish the mods would ban you and everyone else who keeps spoiling this place, but they probably won't. A couple of seasons ago they did, but now that the plots have evened up they seem lax.

Castle Black is located roughly center of the Wall.

When the commander of Eastwatch informed Stannis of how dire the situation was, Stannis left his infantry there, just took his cavalry and rode hard for Castle Black.","Eastwatch by-the-sea

Now I rank him under any Game of Thrones character. Fuck that guy.","I wrote this in the combined subreddit but here's a little thing for you. I think it shows that Stannis isn't some evil power hungry person. Yes what happened was horrible but he did it for a greater good.

All your life you want to be noble, loved, and a hero. Then someone tells you that you actually are destined to be the hero and the king. It all seems great at first but it turns out being the hero doesn't mean you get to be loved. In fact now you have to start doing some pretty dark shit. You're burning people for hell's sake! But you're meant to be king, this god whose power you have seen says that you have to do these things. Then suddenly you're about to execute the one person who really respects and cares for you, he's one of your best friends. And then in this crazy quick sequence of events he's your hand, you're now destined to be a hero that will fight off a threat to the North, and you're heading to the Wall. You're starting to doubt yourself and honestly you're afraid but you have to do this it's your destiny.

So now you've preserved the Night's Watch but you see how weak they really are. You realize you need to be king to stop what your trusted adviser says is coming. So you head South and things start to go to shit. You're in a hurry but you're moving so slow. And then tragedy happens... you're attacked in the night. Things are falling apart. Then this offer comes. A promise of victory. A sacrifice, the biggest one you've ever made, for a win. At this point you don't doubt this lord of light. All you really doubt is yourself. But this is your destiny, to be the hero. You don't even wan't to be the hero anymore. But you have to. To save everyone. You know none of them will appreciate you. And now you're going to kill her. Your daughter. Your only child. And she's screaming at you to stop. But you, Stannis Baratheon, you are Iron. And Iron does not bend. You apply pressure until it shatters, until it breaks. And God you are so close to breaking. Selyse is gone now, she's trying to stop it. Your soldiers are looking at you like a monster. But you don't care. You only care about her and she's gone but it meant something... it had to. You're going to win now. You know this. You have to save them all.

Now this is why I love Stannis. And the saddest part is that he will never be the hero in the end. He's not the savior. Mel is either blind or lying. Eventually he will learn this and that moment... that is when the iron shatters.

And I can't wait to see where the shards land.","Ok guys I get it Stannis snapped, at least his creepy eyed wife showed a little emotion. I wonder when Davos will find out.",Stannis no longer the Mannis.,"Stannis was my favorite character in the entire show, now he's ruined. If they wanted a heel turn (using pro wrestling talk here), they sure as fuck got one. I'm so disappointed because I wanted to be able to keep rooting for him, but I just can't now. 

I hope he defeats the Boltons but loses a bigger battle later on, then realizes that killing his daughter was for absolutely nothing and atones for his sins by killing Melisandre in a brutal way and admitting how wrong he was for what he did. 

Ser Davos is still the man though, he's my Stannis replacement now. ","So what's the plan for Stannis now? He'll take Winterfell, but he has no heir and needs to lead an army from South in what is essentially a pointless war for him. He'll have the crown for a few years if he even gets there, all the whilst being totally miserable because he's a fucking bastard who deserves to be *insert worse way of dying than burned alive*, and has no way of continuing the line short of having a bastard with Melisandre and legitimising it.","Stannis was my jack Bauer.

In fact, Melisandre told Stannis that he would betray his family back in Season 2.

Stannis to me has been the kind of character that believes in his Destiny. Yes he is a family man, but family comes second, another thing that was made clear in Season 2. He had his brother killed, he burned his brother in law, he cheated on his wife with Melisandre. He had anyone killed to appease his god whether he believed it or not because although he may not believe in R'hllor, he does believe in Melisandres power. And that power is what will help him achieve what he sees as his destiny. Again in Stannis eyes Destiny trumps Family.",I think that the writers did an amazing job of humanizing Stannis this season and making us forget what a fucking lunatic he is.,">I'm not supporting him just saying religious fanatics gonna fanatic.

He's not a religious fanatic, he only believes what he's shown. Don't remember the brother in law, but killing his own brother wasn't as big of an issue because he declared war on him. Renly wronged him, even Davos says this.

This daughter bullshit just made him full-on irredeemable. She was not only completely innocent, but Stannis' *daughter*. Who cares about Stannis anymore?

He said he was no pious man who would defend his faith to his dying breath (as did some lords including Stannis father-in-law) but he did pray to the father and the smith ocasionally.  He disapproved of Stannis' methods and at that moment he started stubbonly acting against the wishes of his king (which almost cost him his own head). He defied Stannis again to save Gendry (at least in the show, but this is r HBOGameofthrones) , a boy whom he had only known for MOMENTS and still refused to let him die solely because he was HIS brother's son, even if just a bastard for whom Robert was never an actual fatherly figure Davos argued that he could not just simply kill someone who was his kin (at this point he elaborates why Renly's death was kinda ok for he was stubbornly claiming Stannis' right to the throne).

You don't get muscles like that without going through male puberty. ,"in reality, female humans are fully capable of achieving large muscles, if they train and perform great deals of physical activity; for warriors that have spent their entire lives doing drills with weapons and the like, it is not unimaginable that some, if not all, are still capable of growing impressive amounts muscle mass",[What are you smoking?](http://gifsec.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2014/05/Barack-Obama-Confused-gif.gif),"I liked the irony of the ""breaker of chains"" chaining her dragons","I agree with you. I don't think that she was written that way, but is certainly comes off that way in certain scenes. It's more of a humorous and coincidental metaphor than a meaningful or deliberate one imo.","The beauty of the show is that there isn't just one protagonist. There are many. There are also no strictly good or strictly bad characters. If I HAD to pick one character who was the moral compass and protagonist of the show, I would say Bran Stark, but I think every character has good and redeeming qualities and every character has made bad choices in the show. Except for Ramsey Snow. He is just an asshole through and through.",Why do you think it's good versus evil? I've seen only a couple evil characters and no truly good ones,"Daenerys Targaryen - Righteous perhaps to a fault, but generally a good person.  Her family founded the Seven Kingdoms and she's fighting to restore Targaryen rule.  A true people's champion.

Jon Snow - A man of duty and honor, one of the few people who wants to fight the true war against the white walkers.  Mysterious lineage which may yet come into play.

Bran Stark - A good person, brave, and capable of self-sacrifice.  Mysterious powers with a great fate.  His followers believe that he is the only person that matters and will somehow save all mankind (prophecy?).

Arya Stark - Perhaps more of an antihero.  Sharp, brave, and ruthless, she has set herself on a path of vengeance and lists some of the most powerful people in Westeros as her sworn enemies and future targets.

Other possible protagonists: Tyrion, Stannis, Oberyn, Varys 
","I'd like to point out an important fact and I believe I can best state this by saying George R.R. Martin has clearly shown that even if you have a spacecraft filled with four of the main character's on board, they could still die (Family Guy - Star Wars reference for the uninitiated (Dark Knight Rises reference for the noobs lol) but we are the initiated). The protagonist of any story must survive until the end of the entire series or die dramatically and the rest of the story has to be about him/her.  So a key fact about any character you choose is their survivability rate.  While I, so far, love all of your responses I haven't heard anyone argue that their character will likely survive because... then analyze.  For example: Denaerys isn't surrounded by people that wish to kill her but allies and well trained soldiers.  Joffrey, while powerful and surrounded by guards, also lived in a city that was FILLED with cutthroats and people fighting for power for different reasons.

In the tale of Beowulf, the hero is Beowulf because of his feats of strength and honor to God and his ""new"" family; however, in the tale of Grendel, Grendel is the protagonist because of the stories point of view.  I would argue that the protagonist doesn't always have to be necessarily good but the main character of the story and the character with the highest survivability rate.","I would say Jon Snow and Denaerys would work as well as Bran, although I think Bran's part will be the most important. But yeah, there's no one protagonist of course -- Ned Stark was the obvious protagonist in Season 1.","Could not agree more, but do you think he'll last until the end of the show?",Ned Stark was truly good. But I guess that didn't turn out so well for him.,So the point of this was to determine if people could compel others with an argument as to whom they thought best demonstrated a morally righteous champion with better than most chances of surviving the entire series.  What I'm most interested in is not their answer but their argument.  ,"This post is by far my favorite.  Gives direct answers with analysis of major story references and gives us insight into what could happen towards the end of the series, allowing us to infer that they should survive.  I think one thing I should have probably mentioned though, and I may or may not add this to the main question is their survivability rating.  I'll explain in comments to follow.

Great job!",Not Tyrion tho? I've always thought of him as one of the main protagonists,[removed],"Ned betrayed his king and best friend by warning the queen (Cersei) so that she could escape with her children after committing treason.  Then he falsely confessed in an attempt to save himself and his children.

You might say that he had good intentions, but some of them were selfish and he was not truly good according to his own moral code.

I'd say Brienne may be the closest thing to a truly good character.
","My argument is that being a morally righteous character does not imply that one will be the hero and live to the end. The only characters I can see surviving are those used to tell the story of a location (eg: Danaerys in Essos). If such a character dies, we lose our sole perspective and it would make their story up to that point a waste. This isn't your average fantasy novel, it's more like a history book.","I agree with that purposefully vague statement, but (as far as I can tell) he always made the morally right choice, even at the cost of great personal sacrifice.","Good point about Ned. And now that you mention it I think you're right about Brienne. I'm trying to think if she ever did anything immoral and I can't think of anything, but the series isn't over so we'll see!",Well said.,I don't know that it was morally right to kill the Night's Watchman in the firsts episode for running for his life aka deserting. ,"I like that you caught my vagueness. I do agree that he's the most morally conscious character in the story, with Robb in a similar spot. Both take their mistakes and follow them to the grave rather than break their morals.","I kinda see where you're coming from, but  I think he was doing the right thing. Ned Stark was warden of the North. Part of his job was catching deserters from the wall and punishing (decapitating) them. Whether or not the law that desertion = death is morally justified, it's Ned's moral obligation to do his job and give the man what the law says he deserves. This is just my perspective. I'd love to see what others have to say about it.",Joffery did what he did because he enjoyed it. Stannis did what he did for what he believed was the greater good. Big difference. ,"There's no source to suggest Stannis burned 'scores of loyal supporters', I'm not sure where you are getting that.

It's important to put Stannis' actions into context with regards to the world he lives in.

On screen, Stannis has burned alive 4 people: Lord Florent and his wife, Mance, and of course, Shireen.

Mance was a Night's watch deseter.  That'll get killed (Ned kills a deserter in episode 1).  The Florents refused Stannis' orders.  That'll get you killed. (Jon killed Slynt for the same thing, basically)

That leaves Shireen, which was horrible.  Stannis was misguided and wrong, but his motivations were good, and he certainly did not enjoy what he did.  But he was basically told he has to sacrifice his own daughter to save the world, and he does it.  He gives up the thing he most loves in the world to save a realm that has largely rejected him.  It's horrible, but there is a kind of twisted honor in it.

Before we compare to Joffrey, let's compare to Dany.  Dany has also burned alive 4 people: The medicine woman from season 1, the warlock at the end of season 2, the slave master she takes the unsullied from, and the random noble she kills this season after Barristian's death.  She also crucifies 163 people without trial or bothering to figure out which ones are guilty or innocent.

All rulers are either butchers or meat.  This is a *fucked up* world.

As for comparisons to Joffrey, the difference is in how the two view power.

For Joffrey, power is the freedom to do as he likes.  It's a free ticket to abuse people as he sees fit, and he does, without a care for the suffering of others, or for the long term consequences of his actions.   He's not only sadistic, but he's stupid and shortsighted. A vicious idiot King.

For Stannis, power is the responsibility to do things he hates.  He has a duty to the realm, and that duty drives him to do *both* great and terrible things.  Sure, he wants to capture King's landing, but only so he can avenge the murder of Robert and Ned.  Once he gets a second chance with a new army instead of marching for King's landing, he decides to save the Night's Watch, the only King who cares.  He burns his own daughter, and it's horrible, but he does it in order to win a battle against a house that routinely flays people alive and is causing the suffering of thousands of people. 

Stannis was not a monster.  He was a complicated man.  He did many great things and many terrible things. He was a person, with all the capacity for both good and evil that this entails. ",Olly,"In a way, both had their arms pinned behind their backs by fate. Joffrrey was a sadistic bastard to be sure, but he had lots of adults enabling his bad behavior from even before he was king. In season 1 Cersei gives him the world's worst parental advice - she tells Joff that when he's king, the truth will be what he makes it. As an impressionable young kid, it seems he really takes this to heart.  

As for Stannis, I really wish more people would recognize the Greek tragedy elements to his story. He clearly didn't 'want' to burn Shireen - it was between that and immanent annihilation. That entire storyline seems to illustrate how little in life we have a choice sometimes. That being said, I seriously doubt Brienne kills Stannis.

 As for the death of Renly, remember that Renly was prepared to fight and kill Stannis if necessary for the crown. It was also Renly's decision to try and jump over Stannis's head for the line of succession. As horrific as it was, how was Renly's murder not fair play? Stannis is a cold and humorless man - but he's not evil, at least I don't think. 

The biggest monster on the show for my money is either Ramsay or the Mountain.","I think the better question is Who was the greater Monster, Ramsay Bolton or King Joffrey?","No matter how much I hate Stannis for killing his daughter and brother, he was doing it all for what he believed to be the greater good. He believed in Mel and how she said if he didn't kill shireen all his people would die. He believed in her that he was the rightful king (which he is) and that these are all steps he must take to do what is his rightful duty. His views may have been warped but he did them because he honestly believed them to be right. It hurt him to do it as you can see in the aftermath of both his brothers death and his daughters but he HONESTLY believed it to be what was right. Yes he was wrong and neither of those actions were necessary or correct but that he learns later when he accepts his death willingly from Brianne.

Joffrey was just a cunt. He did things because they were funny or because he wanted to nothing because he thought it was for the greater good he only thought about his own happiness.

So Joffrey is still the worst to me.",Joffrey of course. Stannis did horrible acts for a greater good. Joffrey did horrible acts for his own selfish pleasure.,"Although I do not do this often enough, based on the thoughtful comments below, I have changed my opinion, Joffrey was the worst Monster. Stannis, however misguided, was motivated by a belief that his destiny was to save the many. He was indeed a complicated character enmeshed in a Greek like tragedy. His army face annihilation. Clearly, once defeated , his daughter faced certain death, and perhaps an even worse one at the hands of Ramsey. Joffrey had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, save perhaps that unlike his sweet but otherwise worthless(as a ruler) Brother, he would have acted against the local religious fanatics that imperiled his Family, let alone his authority. Joffrey wanted his lusts and whims gratified- thats it. He was the true Monster","Joffrey by far.  He was needlessly sadistic.  Stannis was certainly no angel and it was horrible what he did to Shireen but he had more of a ""purpose"" behind what he did.  Misguided and wrong but he didn't relish what he did like Joffrey","He only burnt Alester Florent, his daughter, and was planning to burn his nephew.

Not sure what you mean by ""scores of loyal supporters"".

Cut it, mate; you're acting like D & D.",Why is Stannis even close to Joffrey?,"as I posted below in a similar discussion:  Should we judge the doers of evil as much by their intent, as by the scale of their atrocities? is motivation to a fanatical belief in a theology that promises to save the world or make it a better place sufficient?

Is or is not an immature hedonistic murderer better or worse than a fanatic who marries his murderous vision , to the effective use of power?

",[deleted],"> he wants to capture King's landing, but only so he can avenge the murder of Robert and Ned

thats bullshit he doesnt do that to avenge them, he did it because he wanted to be king","Beyond that, what happens to Shireen if Stannis doesn't win? That has to be on his mind. He can only (potentially) win if he sacrifices Shireen. 

She can't run or hide because of the greyscale scarring, it makes her easily identifiable and with how dangerous greyscale is others might kill her on sight regardless of whether they know who she is or not. She therefore either dies or becomes a prisoner of the Boltons, with the former being preferable. Atleast sacrificing her gives him a shot. ","Your thoughtful post is appreciated. My source for the Stannis burning of scores of loyalists, was an occurrence in Season 2 when he converted to the Lord of Light and allowed his priestess Melisandre to burn the statues of the seven outside of Dragonstone. I believe scores of those loyal to the Seven were burnt at the stake in that Stannis sanctioned atrocity.Stannis was the appointed Prince of Dragonstone by Brother Robert, and those who died there were otherwise loyal and fell victim to Stannis's religious fanaticism. I take your point about Dany, but her actions are easier to justify in my mind than any of Stannis's burnings.The medicine woman had returned Dany's kindness and mercy to her with the murder of Dany's family,the warlock had imprisoned Dany and deserved what he received and  slave master is  tougher to justify. The random nobleman muder occurred after Dany had attempted to show mercy to the upperclass overall , and was met with the slaughter of her loyalists. Her inclination was mercy and for the underdog, here she lacked due process , but you can get it. The slave master did not deserve to be killed for merely slandering Dany- but he was the slavemaster and all that occurred on his watch earned him a taste of his Charma. The crucifiction was part of Dany's attempt to change the slave culture and the murder of Children with a game changer that the Nobility could not miss- I still take your point. The parallel of both trying to do good is valid, I find Dany as doing her best to minimize cruelty and death, Stannis as a fanatic who unleaches Horror ( he could have attempted to kill Mance less horrifically than a burning.) 
With respect to Joffrey, he was truly awful, but because he was motivated by the purile, he was far less effective in scale of witnessed atrocities, than the mature religious fanatic. I do agree that Stanis is complex, did noble things and had vision- but....,",[deleted],"Literally, Hitler.",Came here to Olly. ,"Depends on your definition of monster. 

If you mean ""who was more cruel?"", obviously Ramsay wins. He fucked up Theon pretty bad. However, I'd argue that if Joffrey knew the techniques of torture that Ramsay did, he would've done the exact same thing. It's just that a rich kid from a rich family doesn't learn the torture methods of a family like the Boltons. 
 
I think we should consider how Joffrey was an incompetent cunt who ran away from war like a fucking pussy. He isn't a real man. Although Ramsay is a ruthless monster, at least he has a positive quality; his competence. He took 20 men and neutered Stannis' forces. Joffrey never helped Tywin the way Ramsay helped Rouse. Ramsay also killed off Stannis' army when Stannis invaded Winterfell. ","I would sat Ramsay. He has a kindred sadistic nature with Joffrey, but with his age , he has matured his ability to express his evil more comprehensively and psychologically . Ramsey also had no Tywin Lannister to occasionally rein him in","In response to your post, I am pondering, Should we judge the doers of evil  as much  by their intent, as by the scale of their atrocities? is motivation to a fanatical belief in a theology that promises to save the world or make it a better place sufficient?

","> Should we judge the doers of evil as much by their intent, as by the scale of their atrocities?

In the criminal justice system both actus reus and mens rea - guilty act and guilty mind - are taken into account. ","I would absolutely judge someone who killed 6 million Jews just because he liked it harsher than hitler.

I would also be somewhat impressed.

And we already do judge crimes based on their motives. Murder done in a fit of anger is judged less severely than premeditated murder.",The road to hell is paved with good intentions. ,"In the short term, he could have sent her back to the wall.

In the long term, yea, her prospects don't bode well.  Stannis doesn't really have any allies to send her to, no one in Westeros is going to shelter her, and there is nothing for her in Essos.  The only way in which is is valuable is as a potential claimant to the throne which is the same thing that will make her a target.","But going off your same argument, why are Danys motives any different than Stannis'? Why do they allow you to forgive Dany for her actions of burning innocent men at least the latter two. Rather than Stannis who only burned one innocent, albeit is own very loving daughter. No one is right or good in Game of Thrones that isn't the point of the book/show. Dany, Stannis, Joffery, Robb, Jon, everyone makes stupid and horrible mistakes that lead to their death (not Dany but still) they all killed or hurt  innocent people for no reason, but all of them except Joffery at least regret it/thought it was for the best.","> Stannis's religious fanaticism

Almost completely the opposite. [He even questions if R'hllor is legit while strangling the Red Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sx8Yu_n23c).

In his own words -->

> Where's your god now? Huh? **Where's your red god now?**

(he says the latter sentence while almost strangling Melisandre)","Also, he burnt the statues of the Seven, not any soldiers or loyalists.","Fuck Brutus as well.

Jon Snow/Johann Snuh = Julius Caesar.",All of these are great points. But could you argue that Joffrey was helpful to Tywin because he was the most powerful person in Westeros? ,"I'd have to agree, what Ramsay did to Theon is like the worst thing possible. Theon lost his humanity. I dont think Joffrey is capable of doing that. He'd get too impatient and just kill them instead. Ramsay is one fucked up dude. ","I'm not saying Stannis is good by any means but I do believe he is better than someone who kills for the fun of it if I remember correctly Joffery killed one of the whores that Tyrion got for him shot her with his crossbow just because he could and wanted to. Between a ruthless killer doing it for a cause and sadistic killer doing it because it's fun, I would go for the one who at least believes what he is doing is correct and has some sort of regret and wishes there was a different way but doesn't see one. At least with Stannis you can know he will do why he needs to, in order to get the throne and save his people in whatever way he thinks is best. With Joffery he might just be having a bad day and decide he wants to torture you.","Agree, absent Mens Rea, found not guilty,  if mens Rea is established,  generally, the more actus reus, the more severe the penalty. Applied here, both Jofferey had actus reus,  we need to clarify the scale, now there is some doubt in my mind","I certainly agree that intent is relevant here- but, in my view, it is not sufficient to conclude on the question posed. My query was in contrasting   villains, does Joffery's evil intent, make him worse than a misguided Stannis, who kills at a greater quantum level.Misguided Hitler, did his evil in the name of a Racist Ideology with a vision that he could  enhance  and glorify the Human Race.  so intent of why  one murders is relevant, but I think the scale of the atrocity is more relevant. Hence Hitlers infamy remains repugnant, after Monsters at a lesser scale are forgotten",They paved hell and put up a parking lot.,"hello there, fellow stormlander (let's call ourselves *stormies* for short)

Oh, and by the way, Stannis isn't a monster. Even Ramsay isn't, because he's at least competent.

Joffrey is the only monster.","I take your point. As noted above my count on burned victims was overstated (it was not scores of loyalists but 3- including a Bannerman- his brother-in-law -who had given him ships , solders and fealty)- Dany had received the advise- misquote here but words to the effect of, that rulers must either be butchered or be meat. Dany has generally erred on the side of mercy , generally to her detriment. Stanis has not - he executed Mance Rayder  for not bending the knee, but rather than a beheading or quick death , he went for burning- and here without appeal to Kings Blood or the greater good. So yes, the context of Game of Thrones leads to death, but Dany seeks mercy, Stannis, seems merciless. I also take the point that he is a complicated character, who though misguided, might be described as a Tragic Greek Hero- thrust into a losing situation.","Tywin himself was the most powerful man in Westoros, not Joffrey. Remember that scene where Tywin sent Joffrey off without supper and Tyrion commented on it? 

Even if I agree with Joffrey being the most powerful though, I would say that Joffrey was just a puppet/placeholder. It didn't take him any skill to earn his title, he was given it because he came out of Cersei's cunt. In contrast, Ramsay earned his title as a Bolton and got rid of his bastard surname with hard work. Therefore, Ramsay is much more of a man than Joffrey could ever hope to be. ","ladatnow, Stannis is leagues better than the likes of Joffrey or Ramsay.","If we go by scale, Joffrey wins, though. Remember that he ordered the murder of every single one of Robert's bastards? I think only Gendry survived.","I'm pretty sure that this is not the reply you are looking for and you'll most probably roll your eyes at this but I wish more people read the books.  
I say that because the Stannis you are seeing is D&D's interpretation of him - which is far from being accurate. 
Coming back to the topic - Stannis isn't a fanatic in either the books or the show. If you see the first time he's introduced in the show, he's supposed to echo 'The Night is Dark & Full of Terrors' and he does - but grudgingly. He's more like an agnostic swinging between atheism & the Lord of Light.

Also, I wouldn't call Stannis misguided, more like he's being guided by someone who's misguided (I know this makes very little sense).",I did not remember the Bastard point- but you are right- so by scale its close- assuming I am correct about the burnings of the scores of Faithful to the Seven in Season 2. Not sure how many of Robert's Bastards were killed. BTW- where is Gendry? ( hopefully not still rowing),This^,"There were a lot of them. Here's the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsftoWJ4S-k

It's not comparable to Stannis's atrocities.

Haters must have been drunk every time they watched the show, because their common complaints demonstrate a very shallow understanding of the series.

Re: plot armor. The ""anyone can die"" gimmick of the early series was just a smoke screen by GRRM to obscure who the 'main characters' were. A series can be pretty dull if you know who's going to win from the start. Fact is Jon, Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, and Dany all had plot armor from the start, but since their stories were secondary up until the last 3 seasons, they never truly appeared to be in real trouble.

Noticeably, the 'everyone can die' gimmick slowed down later on because the smokescreen became less necessary as those characters were better established and their stories moved to the forefront. At that point, it was impossible to keep them out of trouble, because they are the primary players.

Re: writing. This is really just what they came up with when they couldn't figure out why they were so butthurt about the ending. People who complain about the writing often display a gradeschool understanding of writing themselves. They'll give examples, and you can rebut with concepts from intro to literature, but they'll just stick their fingers in their ears and shout LA LA LA CAN'T HEAR YOU LALALA BAD WRITING

Re: character development. People seem to think character development can only be positive and move forward. These people whine about realism but when a character develops realistically, with setbacks and failures and possibly never being 'redeemed', suddenly they want Disney endings. Sorry if this wrecks your view of humanity, but not everyone is going to live up to the potential you see in them.

Then there's the ""fOReShAdoWiNG iS nOT cHaRAcTeR dEvelOpMeNt"" meme in which the Dany fanboy ignores the increasingly wrathful would-be war crimes she commits, from locking people in a vault, to crucifying conquered people, to summarily executing prisoners via fire. To call those foreshadowing undermines the real actions she took.","I don’t think you’re observing things properly I’m sorry. 
The visuals, the acting, the cgi were the best I’ve ever seen in the whole series, that no one can deny that.
But saying this season didn’t suck is false, so you’re denying all the inconsistencies, lack of dialogue and everything else we loved about game of thrones being shat on or you don’t see a difference whatsoever? 
I can see you’re a fan of House Stark maybe you liked it because every Stark got what they wanted? 
I don’t mean to sound rude but I’m genuinely puzzled, saying it was rushed is an understatement it wasn’t rushed it was completely destroyed, even GRRM himself said there was enough material to reach 13 seasons even.

GOT ending was the biggest disappointment in tv history, that is the truth.","I liked it because the main thing I wanted was an end to all the questions and I, unlike some I did not have opinions on what the end should have been. People seem to think their opinion should be taken into account when making movies/shows, but the fact is that unless those people are on the panel of show writers their opinion means nothing. Certainly wasn’t a bad ending by any means and I’m sure they’re gonna get the end they want if they read the books. GRRM wouldn’t give away his magnum opus and maybe the trick up his sleeve is that his books will release when he’s dead so he can give it a different ending without repercussions.","Contrary to popular opinion, I too really liked season 8. Yes, I wish they had more time, maybe 10 seasons, but I read Kit wanted to bail a couple years ago and I think we got lucky that large of a cast, who got so popular and coming into fame stayed together for 8 seasons.  I’m grateful for an epic ending to an amazing show. Of course I had my own ideas about how I thought things should have been done. However, I just started reading the books and there are a ton more details and learning more about the history of Westeros makes things about the show much clearer. I understand the ending and it makes sense to me! Hopefully GRRM finishes the series and we all get the full detailed ending everyone wants.","Though I didnt had the patience to read the whole post, I agree with all the points I did come across.

Well, every Stark fan except those on /r/JonWinsTheThrone.

Personally, I was OK with Jon not ending up on the Throne, but I also wanted his heritage to have more meaning than it did. If the books ever see light of day, this is something I think will have more payoff there. I believe Bran was to end up on the throne in GRRM's vision for the story (assuming this is what he told D&D), but I think it should have made more sense from both character and plot perspectives. Jon killing the NK would have been potentially acceptable, but Arya took that glory. I thought the Arya kill was cool and made sense for her character, but it stole what could have been a more satisfying end to Jon's arc. Arya's arc I believe should have concluded with conflict surrounding Cercei, Jaime, The Hound, and The Mountain, and wouldn't have involved her running off at the end. And it certainly wouldn't have included Cercei and Jaime dying offscreen.","Properly or not, like I said it is my opinion and I enjoyed the show to the max. On the other hand, GRRM never said it was a bad end either, he has never said he is unhappy. On the contrary, he is standing by the showrunners writing of the ending.

I just refuse to believe that I am the only one who actually enjoyed the whole series from beginning to end. And it gets me angry to see people bitch so much about it just because others do the same, and the clearly  don't takeinto account many other things that I already explained in the post. It is unfair to criticize destructibly a work of art that took so many years and so much effort and dedication. I personally think it's a masterpiece and I will treat it as such.","/r/asoiafcirclejerk, /r/DanAndDaveFanClub, and /r/naath all have people who still like to discuss the show at some depth, though the former two are a little more preoccupied with countering reefolk narratives.","Hmmm never have i said that GRRM was unhappy with it, as far as I know he has been neutral to it all, never have I seen anywhere that he’s “standing by season 8’s writing” I highly doubt that. 
But if you’re happy with it that’s cool I like your enthusiasm","Exactly. Every time an episode came out me and my bro would smoke a joint and chill out. I think it was maybe my favorite season of all mainly because of how perfectly they did the winterfell battle, seriously it was more like a horror movie","Yeah, so many things got overlooked sadly.","That's not even the real Daario. I'm completely sure Daario was replaced by an imposter, while they were traveling to Meereen. It all makes sense now!","If Daario were actually the Harpy, why would he pretend during that attack that he wasn't? Whether his overall goal is to capture Dany or kill her, that was the opportunity to do it. Maybe that was just a weird inconsistency or something, but I can't think of any real reason he would stand in the circle with like 5 other people to try to fight off dozens of Sons of the Harpy instead of just killing Jorah or Dany or whatever. ","Think it was just literary license to foreshadow why the Harpys are dangerous even against unsullied. It's exposition, not hidden messages","Wasn't Daario the one telling Dany to kill all the Masters, though?","I'm going to have to re-watch to be 100% sure, but I don't think it was Dario who stabbed Hizdahr, other than that, you might be on to something. Dario is also the only person in Danny's group who counseled her to open the fighting pits, giving a perfect place for such an attack.","That makes no sense. The Harpy doesn't represent ""the underdog"". They're former Masters who want the status quo back. They want their higher station in life back.","No, He hates the masters and has zero trust for them. He was fucking with him because he doesn't respect him. In the hood the they call it ""sizing him up""or ""shit test"" before you rob somebody, you push the a little harder each time to expose them as a bitch to you will and then you simply rob them or in jail make them your bitch. Last episode or so he told her to round up all the masters and kill them in the arena for all to see. He is not the head of the Harpy's he has one God and that is beauty. ","Exhibit A: http://imgur.com/Fd36OnD
","I also think that Daario is the leader of the sons of the Harpy, because he had earlier talked to Daenarys about actually just killing the people of Meereen and the great houses at the great games?, I also never trusted him from the begging he was always trying to undermine Ser Barriston and Jorah? and i think once Tyrion discovers that Daario was once a sell sword he will council Dany not to trust him because they are only loyal to money etc. ","This is a pretty compelling argument. But then, I've always found Daario pretty suspicious. The cameras were on him an awful lot during the attack, and not necessarily because of his fighting. But there was also Hizdahr saying he was 'making sure everything was in order.' Who knows. But I honestly think it's Daario. (My husband thinks they recast Daario because the other guy was 'too obviously suspect.')",I think his real goal is power. He can't straight up stab Dany in the back or her supporters would turn on him. He needs her to die and move in to take her place giving him control over the existing government and dissenting faction. Also I think he wants her dragons.,"He counseled her to open the fire pits, and then execute all of them.","Dario did not stab Hizdahr, his point had more to do with metaphors relating to the daggers and how Dario could be the Harpy.",The problem with this is that when they attack in the arena they are killing Masters and leaving most of the lower class people alone...,[deleted],Lol they recast him because the other guy said pay me more or I leave and go make fast and the furious.

LF knows she's attacking regardless, and she knows he's coming.","Have you seen the previews for the episode? There's clearly a battle going on and it looks like it is the only thing going on, no other characters or places or anything.

Also Sansa can't get along with Littlefinger at the moment, so I'd bet that Sansa's army attacks Winterfell first and when things start to seem hopeless Littlefinger launches his attack and redeems himself.

Your theory is fun to think about though.","She needs to send another because this is one of those ""I need to know you know that I know that you know that I know..."" problems.

Sansa received Littlefinger's confirmation. But Littlefinger still doesn't know that Sansa got it. So he's in the position where he knows that Sansa wants to attack at 9:00am, but also knows that she won't attack unless she's got confirmation from Littlefinger will attack too. So he figures that if he just shows up at 9:00am, he'll find that Sansa has stayed home, and he'll get slaughtered. Therefore, he'll stay home too unless he gets confirmation from Sansa that she received his confirmation.

Whenever someone sends a raven, they only send the information in one direction. They don't get confirmation that the raven arrived safely.

I don't think Reek was ever going up the ruined tower, it just showed him walking up a staircase. It never actually showed him going into it (the staircase and room he went into were also undamaged/furnished, which would also imply it wasn't the tower but instead Ramsay's quarters).

I think its fair to assume from this that he went straight to Ramsay, and the build up to him walking into Ramsay's room was just to raise our hopes and smash them down with traditional GoT brutality :(","He knew about the old women because he found out from Reek that people were conspiring to help Sansa. Since her chamber maid was a Winterfell native, he connected the dots pretty quickly. ",Ramsey didn't move his dining room up to the tower.,That scene didn't make any sense to me. Why would Sansa trust him after what he did anyway.,Reek went directly to Ramsay.  The cinematography created a pretense of Reek going to the ruined tower.  He did no such thing.,Reek went to Ramsey because Ramsey told him not to hide anything from him and reek is completely  ramses trained wiped dog. He was always going to tell Ramsey. Ramsey knew it was the old lady because he probably tortured a few people  and I'm sure the number of people who had connect with Sansa was limited. ,"Sansa asked Theon, but Reek was too scared and went past the broken tower directly to Ramsay. For us as viewers we saw him walking up the stairs, not knowing if it was the stairs to the top of the broken tower or the stairs to Ramsay his chamber. When he opened the door and we say Ramsay sitting there we knew Reek had betrayed us once more.

Reek probably told Ramsay the story about the candle and Ramsay lit the candle himself, at that point the old lady shows up and she gets captured. I don't know how they would have gotten to her otherwise. Some say Sansa could only speak with the old lady and Reek so Ramsay might have known that the old lady had something to do with it. ","With the way the scene was filmed, Ramsay's presence was shown as a surprise. So my guess is that Theon/Reek only betrayed Sansa then because of his inability to keep secrets from Ramsay, a scene from earlier in the season.

As for how he knew about the old woman, I have no idea.","I think he was going to help her, but he found Ramsay and he couldnt keep the secret and told him ","Agree w/ this 100%. They just made you think Theon/Reek was going to the broken tower. In reality, he was headed back to Ramsey the whole time.

Ramsey's room was *not* in the broken tower, which I think some people initially thought when they saw that.
","I agree with this. They set it up earlier in the season, starting with the scene where Myranda brings Sansa to Theon in the kennels. The next time Ramsay sees Theon, Ramsay senses right away that Theon is hiding a secret. So Theon knows that he can't keep anything from Ramsay, and he's been conditioned to blab before Ramsay tortures the information out of him. Keeping Sansa's secret from Ramsay was entirely beyond Theon's capabilities.","We definitely saw him climbing stairs in a round tower, though. ",Then why did Ramsay kill that old lady? ,Perhaps out of desperation.,"She doesn't know how bad Theon has been tortured and how he is now Reek. 

Theon is gone, and Sansa didn't know, but now she does.","For some reason, I thought the candle was a signal for Brienne, maybe because later there was a scene of her talking to Podrick, telling him that Sansa was in danger and the broken tower was in the background.","I think Ramsay saying he forgave Theon for not immediately telling him that Sansa had seen him played into that, that Theon will do anything to get Ramsay to show him some mercy. Theon is now truly a *thing*, like Lord Bolton referred to him.","I hope you're right, because if he's willing to help her once he'll do it again. Lord knows she needs it. ","I agree completely.  Also, when they cut away to Brienne looking at the Broken Tower, there was no light coming from it, but Ramsey's office was clearly filled with lit candles","A little more in depth still, I think it shows that Reek was really truly thinking about going to the broken tower, but he ultimately broke down.","We did indeed, but there are many towers in winterfell. The one shown looked to be in good quality, whereas the ruined tower where the candle should have been placed should have looked run-down/damaged I think. Definitely intentional though.","Because she was the one behind the candle thing. It hasn't been explained just how Ramsay worked out it was that old lady, so I guess its anyone's guess. He has spies/He tortured people/He made the assumption that it was her because she was one of the few people seen to be talking with Sansa. Personally, I'm not sure. ",Heh,It is.  Remember the scene where Brienne is standing in the snow watching the tower for the candle?,"For some reason calling it ""Ramsey's Office"" cracked me up. Like over here is the whiteboard where he plans his flayings. And here's the filing cabinet where he keeps the paperwork that legitimatized him.
",I think it could mean Reek/theon went to the broken tower instead ,"I think he knew because the old lady was like Sansa's housekeeper.
","The post to which I responded had me a bit confused because since it's a signal for Brienne, I don't see why the old lady would go up the tower once the candle signal had been given. Was the old lady one of the few remaining servants at Winterfell from the Ned Stark days?","Yeah, I'm going to need you to come in on Saturday and flay this old lady.",I wish I could do photoshop. This image is making me giggle far too hard. ,"I highly doubt it tbh. It showed the candle was never lit, as Brienne was watching for it. Not to mention the room Reek walked into was definitely not from the broken tower (it was Ramsay's dining room/quarters). 

Its possible he went to the broken tower off-screen, but that wouldn't really make sense being as the candle was never lit, which would mean there's still really no way Ramsay would have known it was the old lady.

Edit: Obviously this stuff is just my personal opinion though!","Reek, what exactly would you say you do here? hmm?",Choking on pie doesn't cause you to bleed from every pore in your face and your eyes.,"Well, Margery was promised a royal wedding and that is the main reason kings landing is getting so much aid, and since they hadn't consummated it yet, they could end up marrying Tommen to Margery?

I don't remember seeing anyone else eat the pie.","He was definitely poisoned, you can see it from the blood leaking out of his face: pretty sure choking doesn't do that.

It don't think it was the pie, because everybody ate it, and nobody else died.

They can't cancel the wedding, Olenna said that, so the only way to protect Marge from wedding night with Joff is to take him out.  The Lannisters still very much need the Tyrells for all that food.  It's all in the episode, it's just really subtle.  Love this show.  ","I don't think we know if Margaery knows. She did put Joff's cup near Olenna, but we don't know if she did it out of a plot or not. Olenna is definitely in on it, and the fool is in on it. That's all we know. Tyrion seems not to be in on it, as well.","I don't think so, but it doesn't matter because it certainly wasn't wine trickling from his eye.","I rewatched it.  And I find it odd that no one else is seen eating the pie.  And of course anyone who knew about the poison would simply not eat the pie.  The rest would be collateral damage.

Of course I'm just speculating.  We'll find out eventually.","I haven't had any book readers confirm it, just several other watchers point out their observations, which I'm almost positive is correct.","If Olenna's in on it, Margaery's in on it.  They are definitely a team.","The cup is quite a distance from Olenna actually, Olenna is at a different table to where Margaery and Joffrey are sitting, which is where the cup was placed.","Hmm. Well, if nobody is shown eating the pie, then that is very interesting.

The final scene of Daenerys's fleet likely did not take place near Meereen. The fleet was on the open ocean, with [no land visibly nearby](http://i.imgur.com/XsjVUKM.png), and so could really be anywhere between Meereen and Westeros. Also, there are actually FOUR squadrons in the fleet, as can be seen by their sails: Targaryen, Greyjoy, Martell, and Tyrell. This probably means that the fleet is actually very close to Westeros already, with Dany and the Targaryen/Greyjoy squadrons having sailed over from Meereen already and met up with Varys and the Martell/Tyrell squadrons.

Edit, additional: I appreciate how confusing the time jumps can be, but like others have said, it really is to just speed things up and keep the drama active. Generally, it's just best to assume that if an event occurs, and then someone is immediately aware of that event but you know they are hundreds of miles away, then there had to have been some time that passed between the two. Also, events in the show are not necessarily shown in STRICT chronological order, if they have nothing to do with each other. For example, we have no idea which took place first, King Tommen's death, or Jon being declared King in the North, because those two events are not directly related.","You are right but if the traveling was accurate then this show would just not end.  All scenes are basicaly POV's so from the last time we saw Arya up till she was lurking at the Frey's, probably 1-2 months had past.

That said,  there are a few others that we should keep an eye out for as she is not the only character carrying around the greyscale","> That's Davos

Exactly...

That's why OP said Stannis's life is a lot shorter. OP just realised *how close* Davos and Shireen were.",[deleted],"There are three dragons and each needs a rider. Pretty safe bet that it's Daenerys, Tyrion, and Jon.","Jon Snow is an Ice Dragon, he's immune to freezing.",Perhaps we should bear in mind that the show version and the book version is slightly different. ,"Neither of them are dragons and neither of them are fireproof. Dany just has a higher tolerance to fire. She can still be burned. 
Edit: A word",dany on the show is the only unburnt. even in the books she is not fully unburnt. the show runners confirmed this i think. also only reason she is unburnt on the show is because of the blood magic ritual she did to hatch the dragons on drogos pyre,jon is a velociraptor and lord of underhill with queen tyrie of the vale,hes the black lannister,"I'm not sure it will work out like that. Could also be Dany, Tyrion/Jon and Bran warging. My question is how can you ride a dragon if you don't have fire resistance, which neither Tyrion or Jon have shown. ",I...could actually get behind this. Maybe he's the only one that can resist the whitewalker's touch now that he's been resurrected. Burning with that inner fire and shit.,"Sure. But my point is that in the books the logic supports that one of the other characters ""could"" be a dragon along with Dany -- in the show I think the logic breaks down. ","The ending of ""Book of the Stranger"" (S06E04) made it pretty clear that, in the show, she is completely fireproof.","Curious, how do you know neither Jon or Tyrion are dragons? Quite a coincidence that all of their mothers died in childbirth... 

As to Dany's tolerance to fire, in the books it was a one time thing (confirmed by GRRM) and she got her hair burned off -- in the show she's totally immune to fire. ",Ha. But he does call himself Tyrie. ,Very carefully?,"I think you're right. Jon Snow is ""the ice dragon."" And if he's immune to the WW turning him now, amazing call.",She has walked out of the same situation in the end of season one. The whole Targaryen house either has a low or high tolerance to fire. None of them are fireproof. GRRM has confirmed it many times.,"Yeah, but the reasoning that was given in season one is that it was magic because she was surrounded by her dragons. ","What you are saying is correct for the books but not for the show. Drogo's funeral pyre and the birth of the dragons was a ""one-off magical event"" which is why she came out of it unharmed. GRRM has confirmed this and confirmed that Targaryens have a high tolerance for heat but can still be burned (Summerhall, Aerion Brightflame etc.). It is clearly different in the show. If Daenerys wasn't completely fireproof in the show she would have burned with the Khals in ""Book of the Stranger"".",Yes.

",No idea. I'm just sitting here asking if Westeros is even worth saving anymore.,Yeah that theory is super far-fetched and kinda sucks.,"Yes, she sails all the way around Westoros from the south, through the Narrow Sea and the Weeping Water. That's why it took a little while, although it probably would have taken more time than the 5-6 episodes of sailing they did.","Not much to add than to agree with you.  I thought that was a poorly planned addition to the story.  Why would Asha sail all the way around the continent, with such a small force, attempt to save her brother and just go back home when it failed?  No second attempt, didn't try to take Theon by force, to me it just didn't make sense.

The novels mention that the Iron Islander's longships can sail on the rivers (similar to the Vikings) but there doesn't seem to be a route across the continent using rivers.  I suppose it's possible that in the TV universe of Westros there are rivers that cut across the continent but it was never explained and that scene is quite confusing.","I thought it was pretty clear that there was no second attempt because there's no more Theon -- just Reek. He offers nothing to the Greyjoy family in terms of extending the blood line. It is evident that she initially wanted to save him out of love for her brother, but she's Ironborn, so once she realized Theon doesn't exist anymore, she moved on.

What is dead may never die!","Absolutely. There was no reason to force him or to make a second attempt. Based on Theon's reaction, she made the decision to leave him behind. It was clear to her that her brother was no more. Once he lost his favorite ""toy"" he was done for. ","Duct tape her to a chair and force her to watch.  Honestly though, if she isn't into fantasy she may not like it.   Granted the characters and their development are great but if the subject matter isn't her thing it may be a lost cause.   Perhaps you could get her to watch the first episode with the promise there are no dragons?  ",Let her watch a trailer for the show. If she refuses just drop it. Nothing is more annoying than being hounded to do something you don't want to. ,"I had the same situation with my girlfriend. She thought it was some LOTR Dungeons and Dragons stuff, and was not interested. So this is what I did.

1) First I guaranteed her that the dragons really just take up 10% of the show, and they are treated as myths to most characters, and not just a regular thing.

2) Second I took the shows that she regularly watches, and compared them to GoT. My girlfriend loves Scandal, Revenge, & any housewife show. So I told her that GOT has political backstabbing and sex, like in Scandal, catty rich women like housewives, & that Revenge was basically a 21st century GoT. 

For Emily from Revenge is a combination of Daenerys, Sansa & Arya Stark, who are all daughters whose fathers were killed by another powerful family, and are all plotting their revenge of that family.  Victoria from Revenge is basically Cersei Lannister. 

3)In doing that, I basically gave her no choice but to watch the show, since GOT had all of the things that she liked in other shows.  The minute that she saw Jamie throw Bran out of the window, after banging his sister, my girlfriend was instantly hooked.

So try that out.","Tell her to watch the first three episodes and if she doesn't like it after that, you'll never bother her about it again.  That's how I got my husband hooked.

The only thing i can't get round is, surely jon will go north and fight the WW long before danyrys gets to KL, beats cercei, and eventually goes to help. I can't see whats going to delay the WW till dany can help, if they are going to fight them together","Thing that always sticks in my mind is Daenerys' vision of the Iron throne in a broken castle with the snow coming in. 

Maybe it's just an illusion to the WW and the war, or maybe it's legitimately real. As in, by the time Daenerys arrives in King's Landing, winter will have arrived there and the Red Keep will be a smoking shell.

Or maybe that vision is of the Iron Throne after she takes it...

Which makes me wonder - is she having dreams like Bran has dreams? If she is, then that's why I'd say what she sees is real and not just illusion. ",And where the heck is Gendry?,"Difference being - the people surrounding Varys trust him, those surrounding LF do not. 

I'm really not sure what LF's options are now. He has Robyn's ear - dumb kid who trusts him. Quite Frankly, Sansa needs to go to the Vale and talk some sense into him. 

It would be a major battle between LF and Sansa to gain the upper hand with Robyn, but the Lords of the Vale could rebel against him (theoretically) as they pretty much only have contempt for Robyn, but they would listen to Sansa. Only problem there being - she lied to them about Lysa's death and that could come back to haunt her.

",You think maybe Dany will run into Euron on the open water?,"I think maybe Dany will be the reason that KL becomes the smoking shell. That vision she had...was it in the house of the undying? Did that place show real things or fears? Bran's visions/warging come from the Stark bloodline, so I don't think Dany has that ability, but I think that Arya and Jon do since they both warged subconsciously into Nymeria and Ghost.","Oh! That's a good point about Lysa. I haven't thought too much about the Vale tbh. What are we thinking about Melisandre? Where will she go? There's that bond between the red wizards and the 
Targaryens though, right? I remember Tyrion getting the eye from one in Meereen. That's my next guess is that Tyrion is a Targaryen. Specifically, Dany's half-brother. So many ideas have I.","Yeah, the House of the Undying. But - real things or fears - who knows? That is what makes it so interesting to me.

Also, are Bran's visions and warging the same thing, though? I kind of thought they were different ""skills"". ?","I think that it's all part of the same skill it's just at different innate talent levels in the Starks cause they're all descendant of some magic line of old or something from the stories/lore that old woman nanny told the kids as bedtime stories, I think there's some truth to them. Bran's visions came from that three-eyed raven which is more related to warging than to future telling, IMO. Jon and Arya have the ability to Warg too, albeit a sliver of what Bran can do. Also maybe losing his legs made him flex his mind muscle a bit more than the other two. Like how ice skills can throw snowballs but also summon a blizzard but some classes have more skill points to begin with so they can summon blizzards quicker.

But I guess you never know. Targaryens have some fucked up weird magic going on too.

There were no people in her vision? So unless KL is totally abandoned and covered in snow it was probably a metaphor like the other visions...is what my literature classes are telling me.","I kind of want to go with literal though.

dont waste your time, this is better than whatever you will make","> HBO did get back to initially with a generic 'no' answer, but I'm wondering how websites like the GoT Wiki are able to use these images?

Because HBO allows the wiki to use them and they know it's not profiting from their use of the images.

I mean, you may mean well with what you're going to do with the images, but HBO doesn't know you or your intentions. It's easier for them just to say ""no"" and then they don't have to worry about any legal issues down the road.

As others have said, I don't actually see the point of your website either. If I was HBO, I would look at it and think you were making the website to garner traffic to it via the popularity of GoT and make money off AdSense or something. 

If you really want to make a fan site, I'd suggest making a blog or tumblr or something and instead of just putting information that is easily obtainable from the wiki that you put your own thoughts, opinions, reviews, reactions, etc. You'll likely be able to use their imagery as it should fall under fair use in that instance and by using a 3rd party social media site it's unlikely you'll be profiting directly since most of those sites' ToS don't allow it unless you upgrade to some sort of business account.","That's probably a good ideas, thanks!","Will do, thanks for that!",No. ,I don't think Sam hates his brother as much as his father... ,"I don't think so either, but my speculation is not about Sam hating his brother.

Wat
","The Martell's would take the top spot when it comes to the current status of the houses on Westeros. So far they are the one with the least casualty on the game (Oberyn) and their armies has not yet been involved nor have they been supplying resources to anybody unlike the Tyrell's. 

The Tyrell's would be second because with the Lannister mines dried up and their armies exhausted, the Tyrell's are currently the wealthiest house on Westeros, not to mention the fact that they are the prime supplier of the crown for its most essential needs. However, we have yet to see the result of Margery and Loras' imprisonment for the house. Also, now that Tywin is gone Lady Olenna may now take the reins as one of the master manipulator of the game.

The other houses that's doing fine on surviving are the Frey's (they won't move without back-up and security) and Bolton's (not sure about the future though).

The house that is on the downward spiral is the Lannister's now that Cersei is taking up the center stage since Tywin is dead, Tyrion is at Mereen, Tommen is basically a child, Mycella is dead, and Jamie is not really on the path of waving the Lannister flag any time soon. If Kevan won't be able to handle Cersei's impulsive actions then the end is nigh for the Lions.

The Baratheon's are practically non-existent now (save Robert's bastard, Gendry).

The Stark's are scattered but not completely gone. With each children on their separate journeys to find their own path (and special abilities), I think that the Stark's might be able to become a formidable house once again once each path has been fulfilled.
",Also we don't know for sure if Stannis is dead. ,"The major houses that are in the best shape are the Tyrell's, the Martells and the Arryns.

It would be quite interesting to see how they would play that out considering the fact that Varys is no longer in King's Landing. I guess that it's either they replace the eunuch with another character or they deviate with the book but still produce the same end results. 

April needs to get here as soon as possible.","Since what happened to Shireen it's hard to feel otherwise... I have a feeling Stannis is still alive though, and will eventually end up on the Iron throne as prophesized, even if only for a short time. ","I agree, I hope Stanley got a break after that intense barbecue.","I am finding it harder and harder to keep the two story lines separate.

",You should check out Kurzgesagt if you haven't already.,What does this have to do with GoT?,She was an editor on the show.,"Most accents in GoT are non-rhotic.  In non-rhotic (aka r-dropping) accents, /r/ is only pronounced before a vowel sound.  It's dropped before consonants.  If you listen close to actors on the show, you'll hear many of them inserting /r/ between vowels (even in words without a written <r>) but leaving it out otherwise.  So this basically comes down to whether the actor thinks of the <y> in Arya as a consonant (like in *yak*) or a vowel (like in *many*).  If they consider it a consonant, the /r/ is dropped, leaving 'Ah-yuh'.  If they consider it a vowel, the /r/ is kept, leaving 'Ah-rea'.",I would say it could be because of accents of different characters from different  places. Sansa seems to say it the way high brow people from kings landing say it. ,"arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr eee ah

she's a pirate


kidding, it Arya, but the accents may throw it off sometimes.","FOr the same reason I couldn't even pronounce my name correctly as a child. I would pronounce Ryan as Rhine instead Ri-an. Even now, living in the south, I routinely hear people say my name half the time as Rhine.","I thought her name was Aiur (like in Starcraft) until at least season 3 when I read Arya on a forum and was like ""who the fuck is that?""

Basically fuck that name.  This is why I'm glad a girl is becoming no one.","Great explanation. Yes, I was listening closely and many of the actors say ""are-ya"", others say ""ah-ree-ah"". I thought they were saying ""eye-ya"" which is a complete dismissal of the ""are"" sound in her name. I've always said it ""ah-ree-ah"". Do you know what GRRM prefers? Canon pronunciation? This was such a minor thought of mine, but it's just blown way out of proportion, lol. Anyway, thanks!","Yeah, but Catelyn also says ""where's Aya?"" as the Starks and the rest of Winterfell are lining up to greet the king.

Do you really think the producers of the show would add in that nuance of human speech development?","IIRC, he doesn't particularly care what pronunciation is used for most of his characters.",People say words differently.  Not much more to it.,"I think it's a question of the actress and her particular accent. For instance, if you watch Star Trek: The Next Generation, Patrick Stewart seems to pronounce his own character's name as ""Pee-cod."" That's the same hard R sound. Both actors are likely from a similar part of the world where their dialect doesn't handle that sound the same way you're expecting. ",It's possible from what I hear heard they do. Like the way they make the food a certain way that would be in that time period,"It's a southern English accent. To put it unkindly they often ""sound like they are speaking with a mouth full of marbles"".

A comparable accent in the US is the Bostonian accent. ""Pahk the cah in Hahvahd Yahd, Ahya.""","He said in an interview I can't find that it's meant to be ARE-YUH. Two syllables, not the three that some people say in ARE-EE-YA. He said that he wanted Sansa to sound delicate and gentle like a flower while he wanted Arya to sound and sharp and to the point like a knife. These names are meant to mirror their respective characters, obviously.

1. He was the reason behind the past life of Hodor. He used his past to do some action in the future or their present
2. His call for his dad and the three eyed raven warning to him. The Three Eyed raven knew that they can mess with time and that explains his intervention.
3. Let's imagine Bran called his dad when he was fighting. ned would have been distracted and hence killed.","But in what was does time travel work in this universe is the question. He may have made Ned turn as if too look at something to make it seem like Bran can change things, but who says Ned didn't turn around the ""first real"" time the even happened and Brans being there is fixed rather than changing the future. My point for this is that Hodor can only say Hodor for the whole series even before Bran has begun developing his powers and the scene where he finally saw young Hodor go through that. If Brand actions could change things then Hodor would have been able to talk untill the door event which we know isnt true. This means everything Bran will ""change"" in the past has already been in motion for the entire series. We'll just have to learn exactly which parts are influenced by him.

Joff likes to see people in pain or death, but doesn't want to get his hands dirty.  His crossbow is just like Illyn Payne or the guards that beat Sansa or the whore that beat the other whore, it's just a tool to cause somebody pain over there.","Your post has been removed.

They live in a part of the norther region called ""the Neck"" that is dominated by swamps and is famously hard to conquer or navigate due to quicksand, lizard-lions (which is their house cigil) and stealthy guerrilla fighting tactics.

They are disrespected and dismissed by some noblemen due to their fighting habits and cultural isolation, so they call them ""bog-devils"" but the Starks  have long respected them particularly since Howland Reed saved Ned Stark's life in War. Jogen Reed can have ""green dreams"" which means he can see things before they happen, things that happened in the past or things that are happening miles away. Bran can do this too  but he is particularly powerful because he is also a warg and seems to be the only person to ever  warg/control a person (Hodor) and not just animals.

* By finding the particular powerful wierwood tree he will ""find the three eyed raven"" meaning that he will see a powerful vision from the Old Gods or that he will be able to control his green dreams or he will reach his full potential  in some way

* Jogen Reed also has green dreams, and has had visions which told him that he needed to help Bran ""find  the three eyed raven"" and that doing so is extremely important.

It just seems off.

We know Walder Frey only cares about money (Rodrik comments to Robb Frey would sell him off to the Lannisters) and status/respect (with Edmure and Catelyn always remarking he tries to wed his daughter off to the higher houses) and would forsake his honour and reputation for it (showing up late to the Tullys war). Basically he wants prestige and riches the easy way without having to work for it. Despite the fact he says ""Starks, Tullys, Lannisters, give me one good reason I should waste a single breath on any of you,"" showing that he really doesn't give a shit about people, he does really seem to care about his appearance and showing off what he owns. So obviously he's gonna save his most gorgeous daughter for a man with a high title, since she's going to typically be the face for the Freys for more higher status people I'm assuming.

Edmure already said yes and Frey could have easily of given one of his real ugly daughters. It just seems like Frey is out for himself and wouldn't allow for a Lannister to move in and get what he always wanted.

I can't blame you for the skepticism though, Alexandra Dowling is really fucking gorgeous, haha.","That makes sense.

Why in holy hell would the Lord of the Riverlands accept a union of their houses after that ludicrous display? That is also assuming that Roslin *is* Walder's daughter.

We don't know what Tywin might have offered Frey in return for his service. For all we know Roslin assassinated Edmure and Tywin promised Frey the Riverlands.

Just watch his facial expressions - he's clearly surprised by Roslin's beauty, and is completely focused on her during the wedding. A man in a plot to slaughter his whole family wouldn't act like that.","Edmure being in on the plot make no real sense. Edmure is lord of the Riverlands, if he switches there would be no need for all this betrayal and deceit. The Northerners would just get crushed by the combined force of Lannister, Tyrell and Tully. The Red Wedding was necessary because they couldn't defeat Robb on the battlefield, but with Edmure's forces on their side, it would be no problem. 

There is also no way Edmure switches sides after what the Lannisters, and Gregor Clegane in particular, have done to the Riverlands.","Roslin is not a Lannister. Her hair is not golden (assuming people don't dye their hair). Although the story has told us things like Baratheon hair color overrides that of Lannister, it seems too much of a stretch to think that they are planting a non-golden-haired Lannister spy there. 

Also, Walder Frey does owe the Lannisters. He let Robb pass his bridge during the war, and that's an act against the Lannisters. ","how about a man who has to ""suddenly"" take a very conveniant and lengthy piss RIGHT before brothers remaining heirs are slaughtered?","Ok, so let's say Edmure wasn't in on it. If they did consummate the marriage, then based on prior speculation, the Lannisters would have a blood claim to Riverrun. That would make more sense.

The Red Wedding, in addition to helping out the Lannisters, was Frey's personal revenge against the Starks. Frey would have still gone ahead with it. ","Coincidence. It happens.

Catelyn is his niece, and the Tullys value family above everything. The man had plenty of scenes with Robb and Catelyn (e.g. [scene with Robb](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aviRWrUxHg), [scene with Cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2A6BCgP3zmA)), none of them gave a clue to them being traitors, quite the opposite. You get their genuine response to every event that happens, and the series wouldn't pull something lame like, ""we were just acting the whole time!"" It isn't good writing.

If they were traitors, the show would've given us clues about it.","Even putting aside coincidence, what better time to strike than when Robb's closest advisor and one of the more experienced fighters is gone?","So Tywin gets a blood tie to the Riverlands, the Boltons and Freys behind his cause, the death of arguably his most formidable opponent in Robb... And the Freys get to forever disgrace their house by murdering a guest for spite?

I think Walder Frey had a little more leverage than to be stuck with that deal. Roslin had to be a Frey. ","I agree with you, but to be fair none of the scenes with Robb & Roose presented Roose as anything other than an ordinary military commander.","The Freys had no leverage if they weren't going to team up with Robb. Walder saw that Robb was a man just like himself; an oath breaker, and so he had no reason to trust that Robb would be good to him after the war, no matter who he installed on the Iron Throne. At least siding with the Lannisters he knew he would be repayed for his troubles. Robb, out of desperation, might have tried to take Frey's army had he refused, and Frey never wanted to be drawn into war in the first place. ","That's not true. They've been foreshadowing Roose's betrayal all through the third season. We knew things that Robb didn't, because Bolton's bastard was in command of the troops at Winterfell, and because Robb was getting his information from Roose. For example, it seemed pretty obvious that the Ironborn had no reason to burn Winterfell, but Bolton told Robb that they had -- everyone on this sub was guessing it was the Boltons that burned Winterfell since the start of the season. Then we had Roose sucking up to Jaime Lannister and sending him to Tywin when we knew that was against the North's interest, and completely pointless if they planned on winning the war.

They always foreshadow in this show.

Edmure and the Blackfish definitely did not betray the Starks.","The Freys had an opportunity to kill Robb. That's very valuable to the Lannisters, which creates the leverage I was referring to.

Also, since your overall point is that Roslin is secretly a Lannister, I can't see how her being married as a Frey will grant the Lannisters any sort of direct power in the Riverlands. Either she's posing as a Frey and the Freys' claim is recognized, or she's revealed as a Lannister and the wedding would probably not be recognized as legitimate at all. That would just create more of a mess for the Lannisters to deal with. I don't think Walder had any incentive to use an imposter as the bride. ","That's exactly what I said. Behind the scenes, it's obvious, but when you rewatch the scenes with Robb & Roose together nothing seems fishy.","My original point is not that she's a Lannister, I just said it's one of the possibilities. 

However, if she is, that fact doesn't necessarily ever have to be revealed to Edmure. If Edmure got it in on his wedding night, Roslin could already have a baby in her, at which point it could be revealed that the baby is half-Lannister. Edmure would have no way to contend with that claim, and Frey would likely lose The Twins if he did.","But if the waif is alive and has aryas face AND arya is also alive with her own face intact, then logically the many faced god Temple place has a 3d printer.",How would the waif obtain Atya's face without killing her?, No..... no..... and lastly.... no. ,"The way Arya talked to Hot Pie was very Hound-like...I know faceless men can steal mannerisms, but that seems too unlikely to be copied.

The Waif being Arya would be too Keyser-Soze-twist-like, I think.","I see this post going two ways. The first with approval and with many supporting posts and occasional ""Here's where I posted the idea"" or it will be slaughtered to death with how it really went down or will go down. Before that happens I want to say I wouldn't hate it.  ","I do like this idea of two Aryas. It's better than Waif Arya killing Real Arya, which is a really depressing theory.

However, if this is true, I think that Waif Arya is probably the one heading to King's Landing while Real Arya is heading to Winterfell. The Arya that interacted with Hot Pie seemed really Hound-like, which another user mentioned. Plus, the Arya that joined Ed Sheeran seemed to be more inviting to join them than the Arya we know. So, Waif Arya probably assumed Real Arya went to King's Landing to kill the next enemy on her list, Cersei, while Real Arya got distracted by her siblings in Winterfell.

I think the theory of a ""Real Arya"" in existence falls apart, though, when Nymeria rejects her. I don't think a ""Real Arya"" exists anymore and it's just two faceless people wearing Arya's face. So put simply, a real, individualistic Arya ceased to exist, and it's just two faceless people running around with Arya's face. 

I just put this together when I saw this post so if there are holes in my idea feel free to criticize the shit out of it.",An OP knows nothing...,"I think the waif killed Arya, is wearing her face, AND HER SOUL!  Arya gave her body and her face to the Many Faced God in exchange for the deaths of everybody on her list.  That's why she is truly no one now.

Also makes her meeting with Nymeria more telling,,, ""that's not you""

At the end Arya/Waif will realize she is a faceless girl, no one, not a Stark, just a a servant of the many faced god.

Robb was also just a dumbass and tried to make peace with a lord with whom he broke an oath too. It was a stupid move and it got him killed.

Robb was never really doing the right thing, but rather was just going with whatever he thought was right in the moment, which is different from Jon who remains pretty consistent in his intents and thoughts on what's right and seeks to always do what he considers right in every scenario.

She had a gift for inspiring love from people who'd been enslaved, but it was ineffective among people who were all born free. In choosing to lead by fear, she shows she has no clue as to where her appeal originally came from. She's come to think she's simply entitled to it by birth.

Understandably, she wasn’t like her father back when she was the breaker of chains, so she probably felt that people in Westeros would feel that way about her.

Just a minor nit, but I personally would not rank Shireen's death and Hodor's origin story as being the top twists in the  series. Perhaps top 5, perhaps. Of course, this is just an opinion on my part, but the death, and rise of Jon Snow, and the moment Snow is revealed as  Aegon Targaryen, are probably the biggest plot twists for me... honestly I get good bimples every time I return to that scene. Both events had such a heavy impact on the plot also. (The red and purple weddings were pretty wild too, but not as plot impacting as what happened to Jon Snow..)

Those two minor little nit-picky things aside, love the video. Great analysis.","[spoilers btw but if you’re seeing this you probably already knew that]

I’m kind of hoping that Jon Snow or Bran becomes the NK - just because I want to see Kings Landing get smashed by undead (but with bran or Jon at the helm the innocent could be spared).

Lastly, at the wedding gift exchange Tywin orders Shae be arrested and taken to the tower of the hand. As far as the common question about where were the guards, in my opinion it was a tower so the guards would be at the base of the tower and not at the top where Tywin would obviously want to be alone with the 'whore' so gossip would not leak out.

I see the north failing to hold off the army of the dead. Everyone having to fall back to KL then it getting mostly destroyed as well. I see them defeating the Night King around episode 4 then having two long episodes to really wrap everything up.

I think everyone should just get it in their head that this season will be paced extremely fast. I think we will have a lot of jumps in time that aren't indicated very well. I see a lot of character deaths happening without much time to really deal with it. 

Season 8 will give a proper ending though. No big loose ends, no dumb cliff hangers, but having one person on the throne ruling westeros into a time of peace and rebuilding. But it will happen fast and it might not feel satisfying as a result. I'm prepared for that, but I'm looking forward to whatever crazy battles they are cooking up.

I'd actually say be prepared for a show that will be faster paced than you might hope. I think it is okay to go in understanding that they have a lot to wrap up and that to do so the show will have to take some leaps at times.

","Unfair? Maybe.

But I think people wanting the slow build up and development that the show has had in the past might not like how the season progresses if they are expecting that from it. Personally, I think season 8 is going to play out like one big long action movie for the first 4 episode then two more episodes of letting the dust settle. To me that sounds pretty awesome but I know a lot of people will try to reduce it as just spectacle of substance. Which IMO is a little off. We have had the substance for 7 seasons and it has built to this point where shit just gets crazy. And I'm okay with that, but I think people wanting something more in depth should try to realize what it likely is going to be.

There have been lots of them, it feels wrong because all the cool characters are far from each other.","That's exactly right, and that's what bugs me much more than the controversial structural decisions. Game of Thrones was always a character- and dialogue-driven show. Some of its greatest moments were essentially talking heads, two people in a room — so much so that the prospect of a big Cersei-Tyrion scene made me giddy. That's just not there this season, and while it may well be true that the meandering plot is part of the problem, I can't shake the feeling that even without changing the story in any way, the show just could be *better*, on a scene-by-scene basis. A Littlefinger-Cersei scene should blow your mind even if they talk about who's their favorite Golden Girl; a scene where Littlefinger reveals to Cersei (and us) that he'll serve her Sansa's head on a platter should make you pause the show and let the adrenaline rush pass. It didn't, somehow.","Disagree completely.

Stannis and his genuine love for his daughter. Followed next episode by the cold, brutal Bolton version.

Jon and Tormund. Jon and Mance.

Brienne and Littlefinger. Roose and Littlefinger.

Cersei and the high sparrow (although that storyline has gone downhill).

Tyrion and Jorah through Valyria, one of the greatest scenes in the whole show.

""The north remembers""

This season has been slow paced, but that's allowed for more, not less, interesting character interactions. I've enjoyed it more than last season's first few episodes, for example everyone remembers s4e2 for joffrey dying but the episode itself was rather jumpy and incoherent.","I think one of the things I've noticed is that many of the characters have evolved (devolved?) into flat and static roles, where they once were complicated and multi-layered. And that makes many of them, sadly, too predictable.

We've got Cersei, the vain and conniving one, and all her actions are feeding her vanity and need to control and manipulate things, and it's just kind of predictable that she'll let that character trait override sense and circumstance, which lessens the impact of her scenes with other major players. We know she's been placed in the role of crazy lady and it makes her considerably less intriguing.

We've got Sansa in the role of victim again, and a lot of expectations from the audience were dashed when she remained helpless and abused instead of being the rounded character we saw her becoming last season. It negates a lot of her intriguing interactions with Littlefinger, or even Myranda, because she's still just the crying, sad girl. That's her role.

The most disappointing one of all, for me, has been Tyrion being relegated to comic relief. I think his revelation to Jorah about his father was the only scene we've had with him this season where he's having a real conversation and been allowed to give us the heartstopping performance that he's capable of, where you can really see conflicting and changing emotion on his face. MAYBE the scene where he realized he couldn't bone that prostitute, but that was so short. The rest of the season has been him being quippy. And don't get me wrong, I love his one liners, but without him having something to DO other than get dragged around the 7 Kingdoms making cock jokes, his impact is lessened by his flattened role. 

Tommen's the impotent baby, Sam's the dweeby antihero, Jon's the determined noble dude, Jorah is the desperate loverboy, Ramsey is the unrepentant psychopath, Daenarys is the stubborn yet unprepared leader, so on and so forth.

The characters that still hold a bit of intrigue and mystery are the ones faring better this season-Stannis, struggling with his role as the one true King, with his role as leader of troops, as a father, as a faithful follower of the Lord of Light and red lady-these complications make him compelling. Littlefinger, who's allegiance and motives aren't spelled out for us beforehand, remains exciting because he is a conundrum and we don't know exactly what he's doing.

Your post helped me put these thoughts into words, thanks! Sorry for the novel.","Agreed.  I think they made a mistake not getting Tyrion, Varys, and Kelly C. together by the end of the third episode this season.  

The whole ""Sir Emo Friendzone, of House Mormont"" arc is tiresome and fruitless.  I mean really, his crush is gonna marry an ex-slaver, **and** he just contracted Westerosi AIDS, ffs!  

I was looking forward to Varys and Tyrion working with Dany to help her get her Leadership Merit Badge, but now I'm beginning to despair of those three hooking up before the last half of the season finale at this point.","I agree, my favourite parts of the season have been jon and stannis and tyrion's various interactions but there are few consistently engaging relationships.","A lot of the ongoing story lines feel slow and drawn out, possibly because the show is outpacing the books. Some story lines are caught up or beyond the books now. The show runners might not have all of the next steps to run through (they're already improvising on some stories) or they may be treading water so Martin has time to get the next book out.","This feels like a filler season. All great shows have them. A season that stretches the shows lifetime just for the sake of airing more episodes to take in more cash. I hope this means they just gave the real writers and directors a year off to work on something great for next season.

I think the other issue is, everyone is saying this season is nothing but fan service. I think that the show runners just fell too in love with certain actor's performances, and are forcing more screen time for them despite it effecting the quality of the show.

Idk. I'm definitely not as thrilled with the season so far as I have been for the past 4. Maybe its time for them to take a break for a year, do a Roberts rebellion mini series and give the writers time off to really come up with something good.",Yup I agree I noticed it early on and mentioned it to a few friends and they thought I was crazy.  I think this is the first season where GRRM wasn't very involved and it shows.,Little Finger and lancel lannister was very good ,"There's still some good stuff in there.  The High Sceptre's speech to Cersei before she was arrested was great, and the Baelish/Oleana plotting that lead to it.  There's just a lot more clunky scenes now.",You're spot on.,"I think you're missing the whole point of the series so far. The literal Game of Thrones is progressing. There are very few characters left from what we started with. The reason you're missing that impactful dialogue is because those who could have it are all dead, and the ones that are left are worried about staying alive for the time being.

Things are hot in westeros right now--and seem to be even hotter across the narrow sea.

For me, the show just keeps getting better and better.

> This season has no awesome, powerful dialogue and intense chemistry like the first 4 seasons.

I totally disagree. If anything, I feel like you're not paying attention. The conversations between Sansa and Littlefinger have been some of the most fucked up in the entire series--talk about impactful. [S05 Spoilers](/s ""They're (we assume) talking about taking back the North from the boltons which could even lead to a rebellion against the crown. They're literally talking about War with the six other kingdoms. This is intense dialogue!"")

I called my parents to tell them I appreciate everything they've done and that I love them. ,Lots? Name five other conversations.,The problem is the fact that the show has caught up to the books and they are having to fill gaps they created by making changes to the source material. If the next book isn't released this year the next season will have nothing to work from. This show was only good because of the books.,I disagree. I've be bored for most of this season. Those conversations may have been interesting but each interesting conversation is followed up by seven nonsensical scenes.,"> We've got Cersei ...

she just got thrown in jail. best believe she's about to go through a huge change.

> We've got Sansa in the role of victim again ...

not sure if i'd say that. she's definitely a victim, but she is not a helpless crying girl. she is basically being kept as a slave right now and tried her best to free herself and her home, but failed. i expect to see something major from her in the last few episodes

> Tyrion being relegated to comic relief

i've kind of felt like this too, but keep in mind Tyrion has been drunk for weeks or months at this point (besides what uncomfortable time he spent with Varys in the palanquin) and basically given up on caring about his life. talking shit is how he deals with things

> get dragged around the 7 Kingdoms making cock jokes

totally not in the 7 Kingdoms

> Sam's the dweeby antihero

also, just based on what happened last episode, something major is going to happen to Sam. Alliser telling him he's running out of friends, and then getting jumped by 2 of his brothers is going to have consequences

> Jon's the determined noble dude

he's noble if you forget his vows. Jon just keeps getting deeper and deeper into breaking his vows and doing what he thinks is right as opposed to what he's supposed to be doing. again, it's the kind of thing that's going to lead to major fallout. plus, Jon has pretty much always been like this
","> his crush is gonna marry an ex-slaver

Jorah is an ex-slaver.  He sold poachers as slaves to pay for his wife's extravagant tastes, that's why he was exiled from Westeros.",One thing that I DO find awesome/hilarious however is that Tyrion keeps getting captured by more people taking him to the exact same place he was already going.  But yeah hopefully they get there sometime this century.,You nailed it. ,Agreed 100% we could be here in three episodes instead of six. ,same can be said about the 3rd season. aside from the red wedding most of it was very uneventful. ,"So you're saying it's okay because they killed off or fractured all the interesting character relationships?

","I get progression, but why all of in this thread are saying is there is a lot of missing ""magic"" in these scenes compared to the first four. Rematch them again, you may see what I mean. 

And yes, all the scenes you mentioned were alright for wheat they were, but EVERYTHING little finger has done, from the very first episode, has been about getting the seven kingdoms to war. 

And finally, we are six episodes in, and we could have gotten the this same period plot wise in three.

Which is probably true, but we're 8 episodes in with little more than rising action in most storylines and so I think my point stands in that sense. 

 But now we're one episode further, Cersei's still in jail and obstinate, Sansa's still stuck in her tower, Sam's still chillin at the Wall. I finally got a delicious Tyrion scene last night, yay, and the arrival of winter was glorious. 

As for the 7 Kingdoms comment, good looking out.","> Jorah is an ex-slaver.

True, but he's not the ex-slaver she's marrying.  

*^Edit:  ^There ^is ^no ^semi-colon ^in ^the ^word ^""slaver.""*","> So you're saying it's okay because they killed off or fractured all the interesting character relationships?

No, I'm saying it's okay because for one, the series isn't over yet, so there is time to develop more new and interesting story lines--and two, it takes time to make a character interesting. Especially extremely complex characters with dynamic personalities, like Varys or Littlefinger.

It's not boring, it's called _climbing_ action. Just like with John Snow, much of his story line has been pretty dull and uninteresting--but now we're seeing him do big things. He's in charge now and the time it's taken for him to get there is all background noise, but really integral to who he is as a character. ","Oh my god that poem was so trite, and there was literally one one-liner. You're reaching, at best.","Boring is a matter of opinion. You say climbing action, I say wheel spinning and money-minded lengthening of story. What real character development have they done this season to flesh out any new characters? Given Stannis a little relatability? Flesh Tommen out into someone who somehow is less interesting than he was before we got to know him? By my count they've introduced that new girl at the House of the Many-Faced God,  the creepy cult religious leader, and that dude from Mereen. None have any depth, nor are half as interesting as someone like Varys or Littlefinger was from the get-go. 

Sorry, that argument doesn't really hold water with me. I've watched a lot of TV and read far too much critical analysis, I understand perfectly what's going on, and what they are trying to do - I'm saying they are not executing it well. Somehow they have made a season that's condensing two books less interesting than the two seasons that were derived from a single book. ",Got to admit my defeat.,"The Bolton's first dinner with Sansa was pretty crazy.  Jon's nomination and the vote was pretty intense.  

Also, I think the lack of conversation between Tyrion and Jorah, for a bit, was suspenseful as hell.

Or a [trampoline](https://www.joe.ie/movies-tv/night-king-arya-667676).,True,I'm not sure how destroying all the food is going to help anyone. If anything both sides lost in this battle.  ,"She could have just roasted the whole army with her dragons, instead of letting a good number of her dothraki die for no reason. Seemed like a pretty big waste.

And she destroyed a lot of grain and food.","I haven't seen the ""hate"". But I think we all saw the flaw in Dany's strategy. She hung around for too long. She exposed herself and Drogon to excessive risk. She destroyed non-combatants. 

The only thing she really needed to do is break the Lanninster lines. Strategically speaking, the Dothraki are *light cavalry*. Light cavalry is very effective against infantry, which is why the Dothraki charged the Lannister lines. The only hope that infantry has for defeating a light cavalry charge is to hold the lines. (Did you ever see *Braveheart*? A heavy cavalry charge is defeated by infantry using long spears.)

At any rate, Dany only needs to create a hole in the lines. The Dothraki can do the rest. Instead, she keeps turning around and re-engaging the enemy. She kills men who are trying to escape. She destroys valuable supplies.

Personally, I don't blame Dany. It's just the way the show is written. The producers want to give us folks at home a bit of action. So I just took this scene at face value. *Dany kicks their ass, but is again reminded that Drogon is not invincible.*","I haven't talked to anyone who disagreed with that move on her part...

Unless they think she should be riding North with Jon, but that doesn't seem to makes sense given her ambitions.","""All the food""? Barely a fraction, I'd say. ","Did she use her entire Dothraki army? I thought the same thing when I realized that only a small number of the Dothraki survived the battle. Maybe she left a half of them in dragon stone?

","Damn Europe, fucking everything up.","I agree with you.

",I don't disagree with too much but I would switch Joffrey and Ramsay. ,"ramsay is my favorite, he makes the show more twisted and evil. ","Shockingly to some, I am guessing, Tyrion is my most hated character.  It started out as most annoying, but he's definitely moved into most hated territory for me.  ","Eh, I think they went for the obvious villains.

I hate Catelyn Stark, personally. Not enough to celebrate the Red Wedding, but she's on my list of most despised characters. I only hated Stannis because of what he did to Shireen. I didn't hate Olly either. He's a kid, and in his mind he saw someone that he admired take the side of the people directly responsible for the destruction of his village. That coupled with the fact that he had that twat Thorne whispering in his ear, made his actions pretty easy to understand. Thorne should have taken his place on list of most hated. IMO.",How is sansa not on this? Also I disagree with roose Bolton and stannis the mannis. ,">Stannis Bratheon

Can't tell if this is a self-aware joke or genuine shitpost.",awesome ?! hodor ,I think Euron Greyjoy will be more evil and will play a big role ,personally shocked Tyrion is one of my favorite character ,bend the knee or the f***** Mannis fans will burn you whatever in show he became  one of most hated characters after burning his daughter  ,"stannis supporters are like trump supporters, they are willing to go down in the sinking ship with their captain",Finally!!! I was under the impression that they'd never release this!,This was really good,I was surprised that they thought stannis was definitely still alive,"It's not TV, it's HBO.",Is good. ,I don't think I'll ever re-watch the series. It's great but I just can't put myself through that again.,"I have wanted it to re-watch all the seasons but I just can't for that simple episode. I know I can skip it but still, I just can't put myself through it. ","I was going to do a similar post.  Every time I watch it or think about that scene I cry a little... tough to admit, I'm a guy.  Maybe is PTSD.","Even though they don't have to worry about censors, it was still pretty ballsy to show that brutal scene. When catelyn Starks neck was cut specifically and then it goes to silent credits. I know someone at hbo had to have some doubts about that but they went through with it!",Ayyyyyy,"Yeah re watching this series is so stressful haha, especially season 3 and watching King Rob make mistake after mistake. So frustrating! I'm yelling at my tv hoping he does something else... Lol","I rewatch the whole series every year before the new season airs.  Mostly when I'm doing other work too, but it's always interesting. ",But who?,Guess they should have eaten the kid. ,"My guess is Ygritte, but I can't really say.","Probably will get downvoted, but I won't mind if she does die. I know we're supposed to have some sort of empathy for her, like she's the only ""good-hearted"" wildling, but I'm not feeling it. Rather her than Tyrion, for sure ;)",Good call,Curious you would pick her...,[deleted],"Problem is that a ""good-hearted"" wildling still seems pretty awful to me. Hard to look over the way they wipe out unarmed villagers, so if any of them die they've had it coming. Though I find it hard to not like Tormund, dude is too cool.","She did shoot his dad. It would be poetic revenge.

Also, I think she's pregnant: I think she spared Gilly because she could relate to a mother and her newborn, she empathized with her and couldn't bring herself to kill her. And we all know how pregnant women fare in GoT.",She shot his dad in the back of the head.,They did focus a lot on the fact that the kid was staring her down pretty hard with a lot of anger on his face.,"I was thinking he would slay a giant at some critical point, but this makes more sense.
","I don't know dude, I don't think we've really seen any evidence that Roose wants to take the throne for himself.","I don't think Roose is after the iron throne at all. He knows kings landing is a political mess. He's got the current rulers (lannisters) on side and he is warden of the largest plot of land in westeros so he'll work to keep it that way. Should the Tyrells seize full control of kings landing, then I can see some cheeky deal will go down. 

Littlefinger has the vale. By tywins decree I think he's lord paramount of the riverlands too. Just needs to eliminate the remaining Tulley forces. Which will be interesting cause of his attachment to Catelyn. He won't need the lannisters cause now tywins gone, his children are more or less disgraced and their coffers are empty. Smart men like him will know they are on the way out and can't help him.  He's already in bed with the Tyrells anyway as shown by the whole Joffrey scandal. I think the lannisters are doomed, which is gonna be mighty fun too see. ","If Littlefinger aligned with the Lannisters, it would only be a matter of time until they find Sansa. In which case, wouldn't he be better of selling her to them? Maybe to gain their trust? But if he does that, the Lannisters could always leave him with some gold and nothing more.","> The only question is: with whom does Littlefinger align? My bet? The Lannister

I dont see this at all. The Lannisters may not know if his betrayal, but they are his enemy. And no one knows better than Littlefinger that they are not to be trusted. Lannisters, even if it's just the twins right now, want power. They aren't going to help LF get his own power. And Cersei doesn't much care for him.

The Boltons want the north. They are going to be spending the season achieving this. Maybe after that is settled, they will move to the Iron Throne, but thats a bit much at this point. I highly doubt, however, Roose will make alliances with the Tyrells, and vice versa. They dont seem to really have any gains in each other at this point.",[deleted],"Right, I think he just wants the North, which is plenty.","Yeah you're probably right, I suppose I should have clarified: Roose is definitely not a political being. I think he would throw his support behind the Tyrells, and be the man ""behind"" the throne. Perhaps the hand of the King. 

","Littlefinger loves Cat. Not her sister, or her family. And only likes sansa because she looks like him. He might use Sansa or ask the Lannisters to transfer hostageship of Edmure to him, but I don't think it's his style to crush them militarily.  He's too clever by a half, but he's not a proven battle commander."," I like how you're thinking. 

Sansa may get the better of Littlefinger, because he still thinks he has to protect her, he may simply not reveal her presence there. But that wouldn't be fun! 

I'm totally down for Baelish diming out Sansa. Or vice-versa. I have a feeling Sansa is going to do a similar ""betrayal"" as Arya pulled on the Hound. It would just be in a more metaphorical fashion.","He strikes me as a ""hand of the king"" kind of guy. That's what informed me of that opinion. I'm not *really* saying he's aiming for the Iron Throne. More likely, he aspires to be empowered by it. 

But you're totally right about Deepwood Motte and Asha. That's definitely where they're heading, if they want to get a better foothold on the North. After that? I could almost half look forward to the Freys being renamed to ""the Flays"" if you get what I mean. Bolton and Frey are close by marriage, but I get the idea there's no real love lost if one turned on the other. ","Yeah true, I wasn't thinking right when I said he might treat the tulleys delicately. And no he won't defeat them in the field himself, but I reckon if he keeps the lords of the vale and their armies (which have lain dormant this whole time) on side, then he might, behind the scenes of course, be a force to be reckoned with. Just in general though. I think he's gonna sit tight and groom Sansa for abit anyway",I don't think Littlefinger would sell out Sansa.,"But... He specifically saved Sansa because she's the closest thing to Cat he has left. He had no reason to save her the first time, why would he sell her out? Plus he doesn't owe the  Lannisters anything, he keeps helping them out. He can run brain circles around Cersei; any deals between them you can bet will be heavily in his favor, not the other way around.","I don't think Arya betrayed him. He knew and she knew that where opportunities lie, she must take them. He told her to go with Brienne as he knew she would keep her safe, like he had. 

As for killing him in the end like he asked, if she did that then she would be crossing him off her list, and I don't think she wanted to do that. After all he did for her, I think she finally understood and respected him enough not to want to kill him. ","While i LOVE the idea of fucking up the Freys I just dont think that the Boltons want anything to do with the south. If you look at the events before season 1, Ned had not been south for 10+ years and could not care less what happens down there. I think that the Boltons simply want to end the war so they can rule the north and not give a shit about anything else and as it looks right now they have no reason to change their allegiance to achieve that",Agreed she's his second chance at Cat! At least in his view that's what she is.,"Whoa. Pretty introspective.. Jeeze. That's really deep. That will forever be my interpretation of that encounter. 

I mean, some of my issues still aren't reconciled but that's an awesome interpretation, ","No, let's not.","Yeah, some book reader is bound to come in pretending to guess right, post spoilers, and piss everyone off. ",Yep. I like the idea but people are dicks.,"Not outside of youtube, it's way more entertaining to see where the show only watchers reckon it's going. It's us getting to relive the suspense again, because whilst knowing is cool and reading it was fucking intense I'd also love to be able to watch the show not knowing because they pull off the best ""how could I not see that"" reveals. Mind blowing. ",Fuckin readers. One of those assholes spoiled something huge for me in a youtube comment about season 4. I was pissed for a solid week.,"We're not all A-holes... Think about the amount of readers there are. It takes just one dickhead to post spoilers and lumping everyone in their same group isn't fair. I hate them well as much as you do man

My brother's been show-only the whole way thru and, while i'll admit it can be difficult at times, I've never ONCE spoiled on him",I have re-watched the whole series to lead up to the new season every year since the 1st season. Its always a ton of fun to see how the snowball effect has so much pull in Westeros. So that means I've seen season 1 like 4 times now! Always a fun time.,"im almost done with my rewatch and ive noticed SOO MUCH MORE, hard to believe i missed these details on the first run.",Read the books.,I watched the first 4 or 5 episodes with someone who was just watching for the first time.

Will we see a union of Lannister and Stark into a new house, whose sigil contains a lion and and a wolf? And while we're at it, my memory is a little hazy here... Was the marriage of Tyrion and Sansa ever legally annulled, or was it simply interrupted by a false charade of a second marriage, which was never really legitimate?

Dany was ready to kill him for sure, maybe both of them.  Tyrion proved his skills with diplomacy and saved Jorah's ass.  Found a reasonable compromise for the situation that left everyone a winner.","Lets see, a guy he only knows through rumor and gossip kidnaps him, back hands him a few times, and later saves him from a deadly situation they didn't even have to be in, in the first place. On top of that, doesn't even open his mouth when they are sold off separately. It was up to Tyrion to convince the slave master to let him go with Jorah.

He could have been far more reasonable once it was explained they were all going to the same place anyway. Hell, Jorah could have rode in the plush wagon eating grapes and drinking wine with them to Mereen but instead has greyscale now, the douchebag. Tyrion helped him FAR MORE than I ever would have.",Tyrion read the room. Dany wanted to kill Jorah and Tyrion knew that Jorah would never be welcomed again into Dany's inner circle. Tyrion provided him a defense that spared his life.,Jorah was a captor and a liability. Not worth saving. ,Giving wise council to Dany should be Tyrion's number 1 priority,"Poor Jorah...I felt like Tyrion was being honest and practical so as to gain Dany's trust and prove his worth as an advisor. 

But it still gave me the sads. C'mon Dany...look at that smolder. ","A few people said she wanted to kill Jorah, but I don't think she really did; Tyrion's advice did her and Jorah both a favor.","1) Jorah is NOT Tyrion's friend, he was a kidnapper and they both saved each others' butt, even steven

2) Jorah would be a threat to Tyrion being listened to by Dany, Tyrion knows how to play the Game...get rid of rivals when you can. But Tyrion is the good guy because he does so peacefully

Now...whether Jorah goes to grab Tyrion and give him grey scale is another story","That line about betrayal - ""He did not trust you enough to know that you'd forgive him"". That was a masterful line.","There are parts of the show that are ahead of the books, and few that are behind. In the books Tyrion hasn't made it to Meereen yet.","That is the way I saw it too.   He didn't screw him over, he saved his life.  By their standards he has committed treason, and they kill folks for less all the time. ","I in part agree with you. From Jorah's side of things, I wouldn't just blindly trust Tyrion when he said ""oh, well, no worries, I want to go see Dany too!"". Prisoners say all kinds of shit.","Exactly. I also think that Tyrion has anticipated Jorah's next move, I mean staying close to Khaleesi, one way or another, and that it's always good to have another ally, even if he's not in the foreground. ","Just in case nobody's let you know yet,""Khaleesi"" as a title requires further context, just like ""Queen."" This is a little hard to realize at first, since some people (especially Jorah) simply refer to her by her title, probably because it's universally understood which Khaleesi she is, or because they don't quite understand the title themselves.

Correct usage:

-The Khaleesi jumped.
-My Khaleesi jumped.
-Khaleesi Daenerys jumped.
-Daenerys the Khaleesi jumped.

Incorrect Usage:

-Khaleesi jumped.","She's the only person who is referred to as Khaleesi in the whole show, so I'm pretty sure everyone on her knows that name/title means Daenerys.","There is only one (known) Khaleesi at this point, so I'm quite sure people understand who do I mean. After a minute of thinking it even gets better - is she still a Khaleesi? Without a Khal or a khalasar? ;) Still - a good episode for Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons and a promising story arc.","Just like my favorite character, Lord Commander.","See my reply to /u/gomezthebig, but basically it's irrelevant that there are no other Khaleesis on the show; the usage is still grammatically incorrect.","Sorry, that point might have been confusing; it's not a matter of specificity, but one of grammar.

Calling Daenerys ""Khaleesi"" is like calling Emperor Palpatine ""Emperor."" It makes sense when addressing him (the Rebels are coming, Emperor!), but even though he's the only emperor out there nobody is going to say something like ""that's when Emperor decided to build the Death Star.""

Another example would be referring to actual princes the same way that *The Artist Formerly Known As* was once referred to. *My* Prince, *the* Prince, but not just Prince.

It's not a huge deal or anything, just thought some people might be interested.","Hey, did you hear Prince and Princess had [a second kid?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Cambridge) I bet Queen is so proud.",This is the mootest point that ever mooted.,"Like I said, it's not a big deal...

The Night King has been built up as the ultimate enemy over the past 7 seasons. Almost everyone expected the battle against the dead to be the final battle and the entire realm of man to unite for the same. However, this would not work, because NK is a temporary threat and people essentially SET ASIDE their differences to deal with it, they haven't resolved their differences. So once the living survived the dead, all those differences would eventually resurface and you would still have the final battle of people vs people. I believe the show runners have thought of this and wish to have these political differences resolved (one way or another) within the purview of the show, so that the realm is all the better for it. This is the only way to fulfill the prophecy of Azhor Ahai, rid the world of darkness and bring light- the darkness didn't just come from the NK and the army of the dead- darkness existed within the realm of the living itself, with houses fighting bloody wars for power, no matter the cost to the realm. This is the darkness that must be vanquished. 
I feel the only way forward, for the show, is to fulfill this prophecy and have Jon Snow become Azhor Ahai after killing Daenerys.","Euron is far too crazy & uncontrollable to simply be Cersei's lap dog. It was an act (and did happen to get him laid, so it had its purpose...) Euron's negotiations to secure the Golden Horde has them ultimately answering to him, not Cersei. True to the nature of the Ironborn, Euron will ultimately make a grab for power. This may be where Cersei meets her demise. There are other possibilities...

The vast number of Qyburn's scorpions stationed around King's Landing render the remaining dragon extremely vulnerable... when it can be seen and aimed at. Short hit-and-run night attacks may become the strategy, wherein there's never a visible burst of flame that lasts long enough for the scorpion operators to take aim.

The Hound will be beaten by The Mountain. Greyworm will take on The Mountain in battle, and while Greyworm will be killed, he'll take The Mountain out as he dies.

The comment, back at Winterfell about the dragons not eating was a pointless waste, unless something was going on. Perhaps, somewhere up north, are a couple of nests containing dragon eggs.

Since Arya is headed south, she has some more assassin work to do. This time, she'll use someone else's face to get close to her target. (That skill was so far only used for the plotwise-minor act of killing a minor character for revenge.) A major character will also meet their demise. (Cersei, using Qyburn's face? It would help scratch a name from her list)

The comments about Daenerys' instability are worthless to the story, unless something's going on there. She's gonna lose it. It may become serious enough that she has to be killed, perhaps after she screams the familiar line, ""Burn them all..."" She, not Cersei, also might be the one that Arya eliminates.

Or... perhaps Mad-Queen Daenerys plays the ultimate game of chicken against Euron, and she crisps him as he fires the shot that ends with her crashing to her death. Since Daenerys has spent almost the whole story struggling to gain the throne, she's not likely to get it (too predictable) so i expect her to die, somewhere.

Ever-brooding Jon Snow will refuse the throne, and go back north. As he'd be the last Targaryan, maybe he'd become the ""Father of Dragons"" to those dragon eggs, if they're up there...

GRRM has said that much of his story borrows from The Wars of the Roses (Lancaster vs. York, instead of Lannister vs. Stark). As the real conflict ended, a marriage that included the bloodlines of Lancaster and York were joined in house Tudor, its symbol being a rose with both red and white petals, combining the red and white roses that symbolized Lancaster and York. Tyrion and Sansa will reunite in a new house, whose sigil contains a lion and a wolf.","Few thoughts/ideas... 


Jaime is going back to kill Cersei. I don’t think he will be the one to do so but he will definitely try. Though he had been despicable in the past, when his reasonings have been explained, he doesn’t seem so terrible. So yeah it was shitty for him to say that to her but perhaps the part of him being hateful like Cersei, just means that he has hate towards her. 


I think Cersei being pregnant is going to be part of her demise. It’s not Euron’d baby, I thought it was supposed to be Jaime’s so my thought was that Euron in a fit of rage will go back on his deal with Cersei. Also, wasn’t Cersei supposed to only have 3 children?


Regarding green eyes... well both Cersei and Daenerys have green eyes, something that the camera seems to continuously show in episode 4. 

Another thought is why would the wildlings go back north instead of trying to support Jon’s cause? I mean he only has a few people left so I almost feel like he has to come back. I also don’t know if Bryanne and Sansa will stay back. I think they need to be more part of the action or what would their role be staying back? 

And of course the Hound should fucking destroy the Mountain, fire the most ideal way as it would be the Hound coming full circle.. though I agree I don’t see him surviving the show. 

I’m also curious, if the next episode is the big battle, given the director,  then what will happen in the following episode? 


So many questions...",It is simply to late to save this. Have to redo s4 and forward really.,"Honestly, hoping for any reversal of the shit sandwich that has been Season 8 (and really season 7 in ways too) is just setting ourselves up for disappointment and anger.

But in a sense, won't people always be dark? And light? Is there any way to really drive that out? Perhaps the best we can do is live with it? Manage it so that doesn't consume our reality?)",Rhaegal has a damaged wing from the fight so he couldn’t dodge and got fucc‘ up. Otherwise yea I agree.,"Beautifully done. I totally am on board with the Sansa and Tyrion theory. that makes a ton of sense.

Maybe something more like a beautiful vampire in look.....","> Jaime is going back to kill Cersei.

I am bought into this theory. I heard someone else mention that with the foreshadowing of earlier seasons, it will be either him pushing her out a window, or him sacrificing himself and both of them flying out a window. This is primarily due to him having pushed Bran from the tower window, and also, Cersei never having come to terms with the reason for Tommen leaping to his death.","I am rewatching, I'm on S2ep6 right now.

Yes, people will always have both light and darkness in them. The way I see it, bringing light is relative. The realm is in a pretty dire state right now, so getting rid of the concept of a 'game of thrones' and putting the realm first will be such a huge improvement. The prophecy just blows this up and elevates it to the level of ""bringing light and driving the darkness away"", it's just dramatising it a bit.","Yes, it is not bad, however it is there they are starting to omit things from the books, which later on makes the plot lot worse.

I'm not sure what it is, but a lot of people truly love medieval storytelling more than just about any of genre/history.

 > [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/93778)","I think it's because she believes that Westeros belongs to her, by right. Essos does not. 

and of course she is led to believe that the people of Westeros are still waiting for her return",Essos is pretty sparsely populated and there aren't any real alliances between cities like there are in Westeros. The free cities would be much harder to conquer than the Seven Kingdoms since the cities have been free fir thousands of years. The Seven Kingdoms have been united for the last 300 years so I think it would be easier to just make the lords/wardens bend the knee than to unite the separate governments of the free cities.,"I think drenched_anus has made the most important point, that Dany believes that the Iron Throne is hers by right. It's also important to note that Essos isn't a united kingdom like Westeros, it's made up of various independent city states along with the vast Dothraki Sea, the barren Red Waste, and the ruins of Old Valyria.

This [spoiler-free graphic map of Westeros and Essos](http://i.imgur.com/2KQ9vly.jpg) dislays the size of the Dothraki Sea, which is the area made up of horses. The Red Waste is the skull and bone area below it to the east. Old Valyria is the dragon skull to the southwest of the Dothraki Sea.

If you would like to learn a little more about Essos, below are some links to a few of the History and Lore videos from the season two DVDs detailing some important parts:

[The Free Cities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtVEnuWkkrA&list=PLFF586E36EFD74763)

Unfortunately none of the videos relate to the cities of Slavers Bay where Dany is now.","- Westeros is already united. Essos is not.
- She has a claim for the Iron Throne. In Essos she can only claim the title of Khaleesi. Legitimacy is important.
- Size is not a reason to conquer, rather a reason **not** to conquer.","I agree with others.. she doesn't have a claim to any kingdom around there.

But if we're talking about value, then we must acknowledge that size is only one factor.  Sub Saharan Africa is enormous but it's hard to utilize. Europe is a lot smaller but much more valuable. It has better crop yields, more valuable commodity production and a strong infrastructure.


She could take over a few slaver towns and a desert... but why?","Most of Essos is Empty desert or grassland, and she'd have trouble uniting the free cities and the dothraki.","Since I subscribed to this subreddt some weeks ago, I have learned alot about GoT. I actually thought that the series was put in the real world, that Westeros was actaully Great Britain and Essos was the rest of Europe. Just everything in a different time than now so the climate would be much different from now. I feel so dumb.","I know she wants the throne because of the historical thing with her family, but realistically, Essos seems such a better catch as far as size. There is also a lot of room for development, where as with Westeros, there is a ton of politicking to be done.

The map is based on a quote from GRRM that says the wall is 300 miles long straight. ","She could just conquer Essos or rather parts of it and have an empire there.

""Westeros is roughly the same size as the real-life continent of South America."" 
.. so, is much,much bigger than Great Britain.","Bear in mind, though, that GRRM has trouble with distances and such. He has suggested not using the Wall as a point of reference for distances and whatnot","Most people think the scale of that map is BS btw. There no way the events of the books/show could take place over so vast an area relying on medieval technology. I think GRRM threw out that 300 mile quote unthinkingly, having no concept of that distance and how it would affect the scale of everything else. He has gone on record as stating that he has no clue about geography. Personally I cut that figure by half or even a third and it's much more realistic.

Fwiw, I think that at least some of the scale issues can be justified simply by the fact that it's a fantasy story, and that even certain aspects not meant to be fantastic/magical still stretch the bounds of what we know to be believable. Just subtle stuff like the size of weapon that the heroes regularly wield or the number of enemies a small group of elite fighters can take on simultaneously.

I think we can compromise and say that the caliber of horse that a highborn might have is probably a step up from even the most athletic horse in our world, and that maybe the continent is just a little smaller than GRRM claims...

Stoped reading after she started talking about deaths that didnt happen in the books.,"Nice review of the episode and a good read, but what's up with the ""poor women of Westeros"" vibe?

> ""The last thing Game of Thrones needs is more unnecessary violence against women.""

The sandsnakes are women and they want to hurt a girl, and start a war that men fight for them. In fact the women in GoT are the ones starting the wars that men suffer and die in. Cersei and Olenna schemes, Dany and her quest to Westeros, Catalyn Stark who captures Tyrion and now the Sand Snakes just to give you a few examples. 

> ""Another female character that has been getting the raw treatment is Melisandre, who tried and failed to seduce Jon Snow at the Wall.""

Seduce? I'd say that was damn rapey. 

> ""It wasn’t just the ladies of Westeros having a rough time in this episode. In a flawed attempt to hurt Margaery, Cersei gave the Sparrows some new talons, in the form of the faith militant, which led to violent raids in brothels and the arrest of Loras Tyrell.""

Yes, in GoT men die everywhere, but women have a ""rough time"". Not to get too much into the feminism adventures, but damn, tunnel vision much? The world of GoT is horrible for both genders, no need to focus on the misery of one.
","> At this point in the series I’m fairly certain that Melisandre has shown her naked body to every man she’s spoken more than five words with. She’s a powerful red priestess who can see the future, but time and again she is reduced to using her body to get her way.

Oh hon, you are so mistaken. She wanted Jon's sweet, sweet sex because he has *power* in his blood. I think she wanted another shadowbabby. Anyway, what's wrong with her using her body to get what she wants? It's easy. It's *ridiculously* easy. Fuck, especially when you look like her. 

> There’s more to a red priestess than just producing shadow babies.

well, yes. But she's using them to *kill her enemies*. 

> The value of her body and her fertility is only made more clear if you contrast her with Selyse, who consistently body shames herself for not being able to produce an heir, to the point of rejecting Shireen.

Body... shames? Are you tumblr? The biggest job of a Queen in her day and age is to produce an heir. A male heir. Of course she feels like shit. 

> While I’m not a fan of the rampant homophobia we’ve seen on the show so far, it’s intriguing to see yet another religion turn to violence,

That's an interesting conclusion to jump to.  I wouldn't personally say I know for sure if one of them wasn't manipulating the other.  I'm sure Daario is more likely to stay loyal to Dany now, which is fairly important if he's going to be going off and running a city, and as for Daario, I'm sure he sees advantages in being Dany's lover.

The Red Viper certainly took joy in life, but his brutal thmathing kind of further underscores the lack of characters who actually value love.","Yeah, that's possible. I agree that the author of the article was probably too excited to see Dany get some, because what's the point of being queen if you can't ever have some fun? Daario has come off as a fawning romantic for a while, but he probably wouldn't try so hard if her power didn't attract him. And Dany may have wanted to get Daario on the hook so he didn't get bored and take his killing talents elsewhere.

I would look more at creating a pub that anyone would want to go to for local brew, drinks or food - even if they aren't GoT fans.  Anyone can stream GoT at home or have a GoT party, but not everyone can enjoy home-made/creative cosumables and an atmosphere that makes one feel like they're sitting down where Arya or Hot-Pie would dine.

You don't expect a Tony Soprano to die, and especially not twice. You get much much deeper with the characters that die and because of that it feels like a real tragedy.","Spoilers below.

The ratio of deaths of characters I LIKE compared to those I either don't like or don't care enough about is actually quite low. A lot of people die in this series, and some of them are people I would prefer not to die, but they are the minority of characters who have died. 

Perhaps the books lead to stronger connections with the characters who have passed. 

Spoilers starting here... I mean, Eddard, Talisa, and the dire wolves all made me sad, but I knew Robb wasn't going to win the crown the moment he married Talisa. I questioned Catlyn's future when she released Jamie Lannister, too. The two of them were reasonably likeable characters but their spouses were far more likeable, and there are still other Starks that I like more.

What other non-minor characters have died so far? 

1. Drogo, who came across as very one-dimensional (but who I imagine may have been popular with some fans of the show)?
2. Robert Baratheon?
3. Viserys - who would like him?
4. Ros - ok, I could give you that one, but she is relatively minor.
5. Jeor Mormont (is he likeable? I don't remember him well enough.) 

If I had to name my 5 favorite/most interesting characters, Eddard may be on that list. Other than that, all of them are still alive (on the show, at least - no clue about the books).  I'm not going to provide the list because I don't want to give GRRM any ideas on how to ruin my day, though.",">How is this loss of main characters greater then another one of the huge serialized TV shows that kill people off (Lost, Sopranos, etc.)

Well, if Tony Soprano died in Season 1 of the show, it would be about the same. Reading it as a traditional TV show, the Starks were presented as the main characters of the show in season 1, and Ned was *the* protagonist.

The end of season 1 basically says, ""there is no protagonist. Deal with it.""","I think it is overstated. Its a blockbuster show where you should expect death. Especially in the medieval setting. I can't compare it to too many similar shows as I watch comedies more but from what I saw of Lost there was definitely lots of middle and upper main characters who died but I think GOTs is different because you start to support certain characters more than others and its a blow to the face when those who you want to succeed are killed. With Lost there was only two sides(at the beginning, I know it starts getting more complex later) so you are always supporting the plane crash survivors and your levels of support don't swell just before your hopes are dashed.

Did that make sense. I felt kind of rambly. ","People seem to forget to point out that it wasn't just Catlyn and Robb that died, it was also the stark army. This is what hit me hardest to be honest. We hasn't just lost two big characters, we also lost any hope of the Starks' cause continuing. We won't even see a brotherhood style guerrilla war because there is almost nobody left to do that.","I've never seen Sopranos, but what separates GoT from Lost IMHO is the manner in which characters die.

In Lost, the character deaths have meaning, it's always a sacrifice for the greater cause. It's satisfying in the context of conventional storytelling. Everyone gets a good death.

On Game of Thrones, character deaths are sudden and unforgiving. They often lack meaning. It can leave you feeling sick for days. It's still satisfying because on some level we understand that death really works that way.","I suspect it's a matter of genre expectations; for a fantasy series, GoT has an amazingly high kill rate for heroic characters. In the context of brutal television shows, GoT's has a high kill rate but is comparable with horror (LOST) and crime (Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Shield, Murder She Wrote, etc). GoT breaks genre expectations and, while dressed up as fantasy, incorporates historical realism and tragic plot elements. GoT is a cake walk when compared with a tragic bloodbath like Hamlet. The show does keep to tragic plot conventions - deaths aren't arbitrary.

In the prelude and opening act of a tragedy, death is used to set the events of the main plot into motion. Jon Arryn and Robert Baratheon's deaths both fit this. Early deaths can also be used to motovate and empower the remaining characters. All the Stark kids are driven by their father's death. The deaths of Viserys and Drogo freed Dany from her expected role as a woman.

In the middle act, death is used to reinforce tragic themes in a work. Renley was prideful, lazy, and didn't take the war or the idea of Kingship seriously (his death also kicked off Brienne and Margerey's much more complex plot arcs). Robb's arc and eventual death closely paralleled Ned's - too much noble, too little cunning. Cat's was pure tragedy as she died believing all her sons were dead. Ros died because she tried to play the game and wasn't careful enough. 

I disagree with the ""anyone can die"" claim - the show doesn't arbitrarily kill off complex characters who haven't completed reasonable plot arcs, and it doesn't kill off important characters when it wouldn't move the plot forward or sufficiently impact more complex characters. As an example, it would have been completely senseless for Bran to have died in the middle of this last season. There's been a ton of buildup about him going beyond the Wall and finding the three-eyed-raven. He's also the rightful Lord of Winterfell in hiding. It would also be bizarre to see favorite manipulators like Varys and Littlefinger die before their diaboloical plans become clearer to the audience.

Incidentally, I was surprised to see that Davos had survived the battle of Blackwater. It seemed like he arced nicely and tragically with his intense devotion to his King. If his son hadn't been around and died in the battle, his chances for survival would probably have been nil.",You're only halfway through book 3.,"Using the sopranos as an example, [Sopranos (All) *and* GoT (all show) Spoilers](/s ""only three of the characters listed as 'main characters' in the sopranos wikipedia page were killed *over six seasons*: the grandma, Richie Aprile, and Adriana. And you could hardly say the grandma's death was as dramatic and unexpected as some of the GoT ones. She was not a key character in the same way Ned was. Ned, Cat and Robb's deaths would be more like, say Tony, Anthony jr. and Chris Moltesante all being killed off within the *first three* seasons. On top of the starks, don't forget Drogo (a big fan favourite), Renly, king Robert, Viserys and Talisa, all listed as main characters on the wikipedia page"")","I think one difference is that there are a lot more main characters on this show.

I suppose if I were a mother, I would have had a strong connection with Cat. ","There are many more minor characters that have died in both GoT and Sopranos.

I mentioned Adriana, but yes, sorry, I forgot about Chris, because I just looked at what seasons the actors were in, forgetting he died in the last one. I was going by what the wikipedia page identifies as 'main characters'. It's not a perfect measure, but the best I could think of in trying to be objective, in which case GoT to sopranos are 8:4 main character deaths *after only half as many seasons*, or *a third of the number of episodes*.

edit: Here's a better measure, factoring in that there are many more 'main characters' in GoT. On average:

* 0.83% of main characters are killed off per episode in GoT.

* 0.41% of main characters are killed off per episode in The Sopranos.

And before GoT, Sopranos could probably be considered one of the bolder shows in terms of killing off characters. Not that killing off a lot of characters necessarily makes a show better or worse anyway, but I persist that GoT's reputation is deserved.

I started watching the show before I read the books, and I had not been reading or following any GOT news online as I began watching. So when I got to the Red Wedding episode (which I didn't even realize was a hugely controversial and hyped episode), it was completely devastating and shocking and literally left me with my mouth hanging open.

The surprise was brutal, not to mention the fact at that point in the series I saw House Stark, particularly Robb, as the main characters of the show and the ""heroes"" who would eventually take down the Lannisters and avenge Ned Stark's death (which was also very shocking to me). As such, the Red Wedding was the first time I really realized that NO character is safe in the world of GOT, and anybody can be snuffed out at any time. Needless to say, that was not a pleasant lesson to learn :(","I knew shit was going down in it, and it still crushed me emotionally.",Agreed.  I watched it as it aired and I had no clue.

I think the writing on the show is incredible and the story has so many moving parts that work perfectly sometimes.

I have grieved more for side characters on The Walking Dead that die only a season after their introduction. I love GOT, but I don't believe there are any character deaths I would cry over. This is why the red wedding did not shake me in comparison to events in other shows.",Hahaha. Oh that GRRM. ,"Arya could have brought a face with her in her ""luggage"" when leaving Bravos.

More interestingly, though, Arya clearly has some knowledge of how to make a face mask. She put the Waif's face on one of the face holders on one of the pillars.

In order of best to worst (for me) it's 4-6-1-3-2-5

4 was just awesome all around, and 6 was pretty damn good too (just not quite as good as #4). 

3 and 1 are fairly similar, but 1 wins out between them because it is the starting season with awesome introductions and an overall awesome arc, which season 3 suffers from having Rob do almost nothing all season as he pretty much just waits for the red wedding, way too much Theon torture porn, and no real payoff (a very weak season end, with only the RW to make it slightly better).

2 was weaker than all of those, but not as bad as #5, which was almost universally poor, other than the excellent Hardholme sequence.

All IMO, of course.","What are they talking about, Season 6 was one of the top seasons, this list is completely wrong ",Absolute rubbish. Rotten tomatoes scores aren't a good metric for this.,"Rotten Tomatos is never a good metric for TV shows because the rating is decided based on the screener episodes. For instance, in S1, they sent the first 6 episodes to critics, while they sent 4 in other subsequent seasons except for in Season 6, where they only let critics watch Episode 1. These ratings are based solely on that, so they are not judging the seasons as a whole.

",the critics analysis has to be the most cookie cutter bullshit i have ever read in my life... this list and their reasoning is pure trash,"this has to be the stupidest shit i have ever read in my life...

Critics Consensus: ""Bloody action and extreme power plays return full throttle, as 'Game of Thrones' enjoys a newfound liberation from the world of the source material, resulting in more unexpected thrills.""",[removed],"My thoughts on your points.  I've read the first two books, but I don't know any spoilers and everything below is based on the show.

1) I would be pretty down with Jon Snow and Tyrion bonding again, but I think it would be more awesome if he were to go be friends with Danaerys and teach her how to train her dragons.  He's all hip with the books, so maybe he knows a thing or two.  Plus those crazy kids have lots in common, like both their moms died during their birth.  

2) As others have said, I want to merge this with your #5 and have her meet J'aquen H'ghar again.  Or Syrio, if he's still hanging in there.

3) Power vacuum!  Cersei finally has everything she ever wanted - rule of the lands and a deranged zombie sidekick (or so I assume the Mountain will end up).  I'm actually pretty pumped to watch her fuck it all up, cuz she isn't as smart or awesome as she thinks she is.

4) Meh, Rickon.  I'd be more interested to see Osha again honestly.

5) See #2.

6) Sandor as in the Hound?  The guy Arya left dying?  Not that I wouldn't be happy if he miraculously survived, but...

7) I'm really hoping we'll get more wildling backstory in S5.  Honestly I felt pretty bad for them at the end of S4, what with the whitewalkers and all I would want to gtfo as well.  I'm interested how they'll jive with Stannis, since he's all rules and duty, and they're all like 'fuck the system'.

8) Jaime is right up there with my favorite characters.  I hope he'll finally realize that Cersei is a big jerk and ditch her.  

9) I want Gendry too!  And the Tullys!  

10) theys gonna get it on.

-as an extra:

Jorah the Explorer - is he gonna go back to Bear Island?  I imagine he'll find out his dad is dead at some point, maybe he'll be like ""I should go to the wall and chill with Stannis and co"".  Or maybe he'll team up with Tyrion, or Arya. I have no idea!
6. ","The Martells of Dorne to declare Myrcella Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. I'm sure they won't be happy that Oberyn came for justice and received death, and I believe in Dorne the women inherit ahead of a younger man.","I'm pretty sure that Tyrion is heading for Pentos.  If you cast your mind back to season 1 - Varys is pals with a Pentoshi named Illyrio - he is the one that gave Dany the dragon eggs. - F#+K knows what his plans are!

The Hound is an unconfirmed death - quite possible that he will make it -  there is a large bounty on his head and word is out that he is in the Riverlands so is not impossible.

Oberyn Martell.  It occurred to me long after watching [and crying] that his death was necessary for the same reason that Ned Stark's death was - it gets his kids off the bench and into the game, which actually opens up more story-lines than it closes, and we know they are bringing in Dorne as a major area.

On a side note, I hope that Myrcella has become more Dornish, in so much as she is friendly with Oberyn's daughters.

Dany: I think to add a bit of jeopardy they will bring back one of the Khal's that left Dany was abandoned by - they may have heard of her success, stretching into wish-listing mode for a second - Jorah Mormont may return with the second sons to break this Khal.  All of that is just interesting, however because I am not so sure of what Dany can do.  Finally I hope that Dany asks Barraston Selmy about Roberts Rebellion so we get a bit of backstory from the Targaereon perspective.

Arya: I hope she locates a braavosi weapons master who can/will continue her training, and I hope we don't have to wait that long - her story in season 4 was a bit boring, given the way they seem to want to go with her as a warrior.

Gendry - I'm sure he'll turn up, he was sailing for Kings Landing in a rowing boat if I remember correctly

Sam and Gilly porking?  They might make us wait most of the season and tag it as a ""reference point"" for character development - much like when he kisses her.

Rickon: pretty sure they have to keep recasting him because the actor keeps growing up!  Also - he is stuck with Osha who is a pretty cool character.

Bran [the man]: his story somewhat stagnated as well, but at least it will act as an ancient history lesson when we learn about these ""Children of the Forest.""

I think that is all I have to add, =)
","1) I don't think he's going to the wall, my guess is that he's either going to Dorne to meet up with the Martells or Essos to meet up with Dany.

2) Pretty sure she's going to Bravos (where Davos and Stannis went to)

3) Stannis will be fighting the White Walkers at the Wall, while Cersei is probably going to have to deal with the Iron Bank, while her ally Roose Bolton will continue the war against Balon Greyjoy.

4) Osha was pretty concerned about the White Walkers so I bet he's taking Rickon as far south as possible. Maybe Dorne? :P

5) If Arya is going to Bravos she'll probably meet J'Aqen again.

6) Agreed!

7) Something tells me they're going to be fire fodder for Stannis and the Red Woman.

8) Jaime is very interesting, we saw what appeared to be a rape scene with on Cersie, but she seemed pretty unfazed by it afterwards and then goes back to embracing him. I think Jamie just turns into an animal around Cersie, and vise-versa. 

9) He's with Blackfish, Greatjon Umber and Chuck Cunningham.

10) Samwell has grown some pendulous gonads since season 1. We see him get poked by a practice sword and go crying ""I yield! I yield!"" and now he became a fuckin' action hero in s04e09. I'm totally rooting for him! And he does have a point about the vows, as long as he doesn't knock her up or marry her, he should be safe.","I think several people will die - mostly minor characters, some major ones. We're also likely to see someone SUPER AWESOME introduced, only to watch them die a horribly gruesome death. RIP in pieces Oberyn Martell",[deleted],"With regards to point six, you seem to be conflating Gregor Clegane (the Mountain) and Sandor Clegane (the Hound).","I think Drone doesn't believe in 'Sins of the Father'. Tommen and Mycella are safe



I hope","Not really predictions but just some commentary-

I'd love to see Theon's misery come to an end in a gruesome, important way. So over him. 

I love the way the show is turning in regards to Bran and ""magic"" (white walkers, etc). I hope your prediction turns true. 

Nothing better happen to my bae Jon Snow. I'll be so mad, forever.

Sure, Rhaegar might have been married to Elia, but marriage doesn't seem to stop many people in the story.  I think that Ned took Jon, his nephew, claimed he was his own bastard, and raised him.  Robert hate, hate hates Targaryens and would have killed Jon had he knew, since he was both a Targaryen and a reminder of what happened to Lyanna.

I'm probably completely off my rocker, but who knows.  ","That the book readers are only speculating about who John Snow's mom is spoils the fact that his mother's identity is currently unknown and will not be revealed for however many seasons the show is behind the books (even if just 1).

A pretty small spoiler, but could be considered one nonetheless. Generally, discussing matters that the book readers speculate can contain intrinsic spoilers.

While WE (and a few of the characters) know that they are not, most characters are unaware (despite the rumors).

They are also not legitimized bastards, like Ramsey, because they are not considered to be bastards. ","Crazy theory, Stannis dies (maybe foul play from red bitch) red bitch wants to make Jon King, I don't think Jon would go for this Jon kills red bitch.","Oh my god, I'm sorry - totally dropped the ball on that one.

And no,  I don't agree. He's a fine commedic actor,  but Peter Dinklage is better suited to carry Tyrion's complex and difficult journey. ","Nothing against Martin Klebba, but Dinklage has defined Tyrion in the same way that Connery defined Bond or Nicholson defined The Joker. Sure, both of them were redefined many years later by another actor, but it took brilliant casting and all new directing for that opportunity to present itself.",DINKLAGE IS THE ONE TRUE GOD OF WINE AND TITS,"It's a difficult question to answer. Once you are familiar with a character as portrayed by a specific actor, especially if it is done well, it is difficult to picture anyone else in the role. Sure, there are other actors who may be able to pull off certain roles. It's just really hard to imagine.

For example, think of ""Man on the Moon"". Jim Carrey became Andy Kaufman. Absolutely brilliant and perfect for the role, right? Nicolas Cage was considered for the role and was interested but he didn't send in an audition tape (supposedly because Jim Carrey told him he shouldn't have to). My brain just does not compute Nic Cage in the role. I can't see it. Carrey *was* Kaufman. Cage probably could have done it though.

So could someone else have done a good job portraying Tyrion Lannister? Probably. I just can't imagine anyone other than Dinklage in the role.","Since this post is still at the top, and it's been a while, I'll throw in my 2 cents. As a huge fan of both the books and television show... Peter Dinklage IS Tyrion Lannister. He makes me believe in the character on another level. The look in his eyes, the inflection in his voice... For me, Dinklage masters this character. From being the last remaining vestige of compassion in House Lannister to his desire for the god of tits and wine, this character and the actor who portrays him are simply the very stuff, the very point of why fiction can MOVE us.",He doesn't look Westerosi enough.

Compound that with the fact that this is its final season after almost a 2 year gap with seems to have given new viewers time to catch up.","Eh, disagree. The stream quality is always bad, no matter what you're watching.","My predictions:


- Cersei: will take Tywin's place as Hand of the King (if women are allowed, otherwise Jaime). Make herself Queen Regent and delaying, if not calling off the wedding with Margerine, and declare Varys and Tyrion traitors for killing Tywin. She has no reason to marry Loras cause her dad isn't forcing her. She'll also try to find Sansa and kill her. Same with Tyrion. Does the Mountain live? If yes, he'll be her personal bodyguard maybe. I think she'll make good decisions when ruling (in Tommen's name) so that no one tries to kill him. Suicide was an option for her because she thought she would be tortured and killed, alongside Tommen, if they didn't win the battle. Now she's got too much to live for. 


- The Hound: some guy from the Eerie or somewhere stumbled across him and found a doctor just in time. He's alive! (please, HBO).


- Stannjs the Mannis and the Jon Snow Show: fighting White Walkers, and there's a massive face off between Prince White Walker and Mance, or Mr. Nights Watch, or the Onion Knight. Melisandre tries to sacrifice little teacher Baratheon, and Stannis is hesitating, as his crazy wife is telling him to accept it, and Onion Knight or blind man Eamon (night's watch librarian) jumps through the fire to save her. Stannis slaps his wife and she falls on the fire. Melisandre says something bitchy like, ""yes, I am beautiful. You're not needed, I'm here, bitch. Burn, bitch."" Or something. I think it'd be better for the feels if it's Onion Knight.


- Bran Flakes: turns in to a dragon. Maybe Drogon, 'cause he's AWOL. Grandfather Time summons Jorah the explorer to come over to Christmas land to bring Bran and Hodor to Dany (also anyone catch the irony of her title, Breaker of Chains?). Or he turns in to the three eyed Raven as Jojen said. Maybe his sister sacrifices her body to become a Children of the Forest pixie Avatar-style. 


- Arya: I agree with OP's interpretation, except ""eyes you'll shut forever"" is referencing the people she'll off. I hope Jaqen teaches her. I hope his old face comes back and they get together. 


- Daario and Grey Worm: get it on with their respected partners some more. Maybe Dany gets pregnant. Not Melissa (for obvious reasons). 


- Dany: becomes crazy from locking her dragons up, like her Dad(?) the Mad King. 


- Brienne: rescues Sansa from her peado relationship with Petyr. I'm hoping they stumble upon Reek on the way, and bring him back to being Theon and liberate Winterfell. Maybe by this time, Stannis has gone to Winterfell with Jon to rest or something, and Jon kills Bolton (like OP said). OR, she never finds Sansa and returns to Kings Landing to be with Jaime.


- Jaime: is torn between sexing his sister and being hurt by her hating personality. He has an internal battle and turns to drink. Brienne saves him, or he goes to visit Tyrion who possibly has asylum with Oberyn's family. 


- Oberyn, champion of my heart: already wrote back to his mafia family informing them of his fight, and that in his demise, to give Tyrion asylum. 


- Varys: gives Tyrion asylum instead. Who knows. He still wants the iron throne, so prepare for some joint plotting. 


- Petyr: offs Robin and becomes Lord of the Vale by bringing Robin out in the open, then making his death look like an accident or murder. Grooms Sansa in to becoming his replacement of replacement Cat.


That's all I have so far. Although I hope we see more of resurrected man and his sassy friend that actually does the resurrecting, Walder Frey, uncle Benjen, little Stark and Osha, and Gendry. ","I think Cersei. She seems the suicidal type. In fact, didn't she once say to Tyrion that she would have killed herself if not for her children. I think it may have been after Tywin arranged for him to marry Sansa and for her to marry Loras. She was talking about depressed she was being married to Robert, and how she contemplated suicide but her children kept her going. Now Joffrey's dead and Myrcella's in Dorne. If Margaery and the Tyrells successfully woo Tommen, she will have no-one left. Also, the brother she loves rescued the brother she hates (and who she thinks killed her son) who then murdered the father she resents. That's got to fuck with her. If her and Jaime drift further apart, and if Margaery digs her claws into Tommen, I can see Cersei killing herself.","Oohh interesting point - we've not seen or heard of a suicide in Westeros.  I think Jorah is your only likely contender from above.  Cercei seemed to have found new meaning in life in the last few episodes, deciding she wants to be with Jamie.  Same with Jon - he seems to be stepping into a leadership role with the Night's Watch and hasn't been brooding or whiny all Season 4.  DEF interested in potentially seeing Jorah run into Arya or Tyrion & Varys.  But if you look at a map, Slaver's Bay is super far from Pentos and Braavos.

I believe that Melisandre IS on Arya's list, but Arya calls her ""The Red Woman"".

I never thought about Stannis allying with the Wildlings.  I think it's an interesting idea, but I don't think it will happen.  Stannis is hellbent on the idea that he is the king and the Wildlings will not kneel, and Stannis' people skills and strategy skills are not great.

I've read a few comments around reddit that Robb actually legitimized Jon back in S2, but Jon doesn't know that (and maybe no other surviving characters do?  I honestly don't remember this scene.)  My theory is that the ultimate struggle for the throne is going to be Jon vs. Daenerys (A Song of Ice and Fire - he's the ice and she's the fire), but I'm not sure what would cause Jon to leave the Wall.  He seems to fully believe in his vows now, so I'm not sure that Stannis ""annulling"" his vows would matter to him.","Cersei will probably try to take out Margery, angering the Tyrell's, unless Tommen is being merciful, (and he most likely will be), adding them to the list of people who hate the Lannister's. This will bite her in the ass when Stannis comes knocking, though he will probably deal with the white walkers first. However, this will be good PR, another nail in the Lannister coffin.","Viserys died in season 1, Dannys shithead brother. I think you mean Varys?","Just want to add one thing, remember the other maester who assured Cersei he could help treat The Mountain but the risk is that he may not be the same Mountain again. Cersei asked, would that affect him physically? And the dude replied, no of course not.

I think, seeing as the unofficial maester was known to be kicked from the Citadel for foraying into weird experiment, I think The Mountain may be revived into something freaky, not unlike the Frankenstein. But this is just my speculation.

EDIT: To add on your Dany's point, I think it's less likely that Dany become crazy and more likely that the dragons become hard to handle, they may even no longer obey Dany's command due to being cooped up in a small catacomb, unable to fly. This would become a huge obstacle for Dany and we will see her struggle to regain her dragons' trust and also, her realisation that she ought to start training her dragons to listen to her orders etc. ","> and declare Varys and ~~Joffrey~~ Tyrion traitors for killing Tywin

",I think she is too angry to kill herself at this point. The only time I think she would have done it was at the siege of Kings Landing. She's too crazy with wrath to go out that way.,"There were several lords of the north present when Robb legitimized Jon. My theory is that we have something much more sinister evolving in the north, something that will not turn out well for Stannis. The North Remembers.","Yep, thanks for that, I couldn't remember.","Oh wow, I can see that happening. Maybe Cersei will meet her demise by the hands of the Mountain? Or she could use him as her bodyguard. This will probably make her unstoppable.

Yeah, I see what you mean. Well, Drogon is the only dragon that isn't locked up. He's gone somewhere and he's the more disobedient of the dragons (note: he snapped at her once this season). If Dany is to die, then I think Drogon would be responsible for her death.","ugh, I wrote this when I was half-asleep.

I completely understand backing Remy. That wasn't a bad idea at all. A genuinely good guy and it would put both young Tyrells in a great position.

They may be good at playing a long game, but the collateral damage of their one ""bad"" act is pretty massive.

Dany

Doran Martell
He hasn't played the game much, but as disappointing as the Dorne adventure was this year, I really liked Doran - """"Many in Dorne want war. But I've seen war. I've seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I've seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don't want to lead my people into that hell.""

Then he will be the one that takes the Wildings and brings down the Boltons in Winterfell.","He's dead. This show doesn't care about killing main characters, and we all know that by now. The real shock would be him living.

There are only 2 seasons left. That's only 20 hours of show for *all* of the stuff we still have to get to. For that reason, I'm pretty sure Castle Black is a goner at some point next season. The white walkers are coming, and you aren't stopping that army. It makes total sense, give Jon a dramatic death, then wrap up that storyline. 

Milisandre and Davos might end up leaving the wall before it happens though.","I just thought.. yeah that's a lot of stabbing to the gut. But it's the gut, people CAN survive that. Why didn't they just show them stabbing his heart, or put a knife in his temple? What if he just straight up survives the attack?

I literally screamed for glee when he was back. Ollie could have said many things, that line came directly as punishment for us all keeping the ""what happened list"": Benjen, Gendry, Blackfish...

It's like we fans have our own Arya-type list going.","Yeah, but white walkers are made by babies. Hence the baby offerings to keep them away.

i root for her and starks to unite... bran in particular to worg the dragons since her control is limited.

baelish has tall dreams and i want him to stumble. losing sansa should be a hard hit. she should never forgive him but then again, she is gullible...

the dorne story depressed me when oberyn got killed. he was so charismatic and i think without him existing, no one would care for dorne.","Also, having died, he's released from his vow to the Watch.  He'd be free to do whatever he likes.

So there couldn't have necessarily been a pact unless you are talking about a treaty being made after the result of a war.

I do not think you are far off on your first theory. As well as the third. We will have to ultimately wait and see!",It feels like you're trying to hard to put 2 and 2 together but you're trying to make it equal 5,Yee C'mon,"Good thoughts. 
I read where the story line is taken after the history of the War of the Roses, down to the names. 
The Night King was once a man, but we don't know who. I don't really think there was a pact between the White Walkers and men. The wall was built to keep them out. I just wonder how the wall was built. The white walkers have a power or magic. Especially the Night King. He raised his hands and all those dead people rose up. He has that power. The White Walkers are mindlessly obeying him. If you kill the Night King, they may just run away or die, since whatever power made them come to life is gone.
 
And so, the dragons have a power of fire. This is the fire needed to fight the White Walkers. 
I think it is symbolic that Dany, the Queen of Fire and Jon the king of the North (snow) need to come together to actually balance the power to conquer the Night King and his White Walkers.  The White Walkers were created to keep back the first men, but it went wrong. I wonder how or why. ",Yes I meant a treaty (I am french so excuse me If I miss use a word). My main point is that neither the first men nor the children of the forest possessed the necessary power to build a wall. The white walkers do. What if they were trying to contain the first men and not the other way around?,"I wrote three theories, which one are you talking about? and why do you think that? It would be great if you could developp your answer instead of merely degrading what I said in one single sentence ;)","In case you don't understand my first point:
Jon Snow wouldn't be able to kill her due to the nature of his character, and Sansa obviously doesn't kill him if he lives til the end.","Well that's great because I've also read the books. First thanks for taking time to actually discuss and developp your points it is great. Now let go through all that : 
- 1st theory : I agree with you on this point if jon is confirmed to make it the end. This is my most wtf theory and it doesn't really stand on strong pillars.
- 2nd theory : You said the white walkers aren't human like and you say they are zombies but as I said before, they can actually, reproduce(by taking babies), they can negociate(they negociated with craster to get his baby sons), they have a fortress(we see that in some episode). The probleme is that you need to see the difference between a white lord with all the previous characteristiques and the whites(actual zombies risen from the dead). 
I didn't really say they want Dany, I said they can come to make some threaty with Jon to fight against Dany. Jon always talks about the coming storm, well is the coming storm the one brought by the white walkers or Daenarys STORMBORN ? Them coming together and all defeating the white walkers is just not the happy ending that game of thrones is going to give us.
3rd theory : Jon does hate little finger but he said don't forget that he saved the north and that's why he needs to stay plus they need the army of the vale. I didn't little finger's death was confirmed this season and if you are inting at the preview, well that is no proof. ","3) Nah little finger dies, you can cite me when it happens. I'm not sure which episode but 200% he dies.","Haha, we'll see ;)",I bet Arya kills and takes his face to kill someone else. Hmmm....

I'm not expecting to see much of them at all for the rest of the series.
",I think so. They have to tie Dorne in somehow. I just don't understand why they would kill Doran and the do nothing like Doran.,Maybe,"I've had the realization that there's two Sandy Snakes loose in Kings Landing and Tommen is supposed to die according to prophecy, so I'm thinking they'll pull Dorne back into the plot this way.",Yea like I said there only appearance according to another Reddit user is the last episode but would not go into detail about what role they would play. I think they must tie them in somehow but I find it pretty cool that now Ellaria killed off the two heirs and now will be a player in the wars to come. It's just shitty that now they are completely done with it. It could've been cooler,Yea I mean the ones that killed Trystane were on a ship headed back to Dorne. They could have easily just landed back at kings landing. I just love the Dorne storyline in the books and live the sand snakes. I want D&D to do them justice,If Tommen gets killed who is next in line for the crown?,No one unless Margaery is pregnant but she's been imprisoned for so long I don't see how that's possible ,"Daenerys would technically be next in line. Obviously those in King's Landing that would have any control over who next sat the throne wouldn't choose her and would declare for someone else, but if we're going strictly by lines of succession, she'd be next.",I read an article that states that Jaime or Cersei would be next in line if Tommen dies which at this point is inevitable.,"I don't believe you can in herit through marriage as you can't marry into the royal family, which is why Cersei is still Cersei Lannister, not Cersei Baratheon. Only the children can be heirs. Otherwise you could get into the situation where Tommen dies, Margaery inherits (if we're going through marriage, surely she would inherit before Cersei?), then Margaery remarries and has children from another family that inherit the throne, and suddenly the throne is in the hands of a completely different family. Really what would probably happen is they'd call a Great Council, which may end up electing Jaime or Cersei. 

I may be wrong though, I'd be interested to see the article. ","Yea I mean I am interested to see what will happen if and when Tommen dies how they are gonna elect a new king. They said Jaime by blood right because of the kids being half Lannister and all of the Baratheon bloodline killed. I may think that Littlefingers gift to Olenna last year is gendry because he is the one that offered Cersei the boy that slept with Loras. And Littlefinger tells Olenna I have a gift, the same that I have Cersei. Maybe Olenna will try to instill Gendry as the next heir as a puppet for them","They'd probably call a Great Council and decide from there. Then it would just come down to who got the most support. Thing is with Gendry, bastards have to be legitimised by a king in order to be able to inherit, and they'd be without a king to do so. Of course, if they want to use Gendry they'd find some way around that, even if it was by force. They'll all bend the rules to get what they want.",but how would he know Ramsay has Rickon,Because he is cahoots with the Umbers. Littlefinger most likely hatched the plan and gave it to the Umbers.,He could have been the one to give him to Ramsey. ,Tyrion Lannister... the Battle of The Blackwater,The stipulation of adding peoples previous kills to their murderers total is ridiculous and makes this near impossible to calculate. i will say Jaqen H'gar,Well that's a lot of work,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/entertainment/game-of-thrones/

","So, there's 50 days till premiere? woo-hoo!","I'm right there with all the Littlefinger stuff - especially because he's the reason everything bad started happening (since he was responsible for Jon Arryn's death, which set the whole story in motion).","Littlefinger's the overhyped one unless his ridiculous foresight is made more plausible down the line. Tywin can't compete with fantasy characters, he did beat all of his ""realistic"" rivals in the GoT.","Other than thinking he could get away with killing Lysa, Littlefinger has always given himself options. It looks like he is predicting many seasons down the line, but really he just makes sure there's always something he can do. I mean, he had enough foresight to see that Ned could be played and to see that he was the next probable candidate for Hand of the King, but he didn't foresee getting the Eyrie until it was more-or-less given to him in Season 3 (if he had, he wouldn't have gotten so excited over the chance to get Harrenhall in Season 2).","Could you elaborate on ""ridiculous foresight""?","I sort of think she wants to be Queen over the Iron Islands in the same way Elizabeth is Queen of England.

This is the type of thing I expect from littlefinger ,Of course!,No I mean that's exactly what he said in the second season I think. ,"Also, re: Sansa, a character (not mentioning who because minor spoiler?) mentions she's dyed her hair as a disguise.","I noticed this as well! This is pure speculation but taking into consideration that nothing on this show is done by accident, it's reasonable to assume these subtle changes MAY have meaning and were not just a coincidence of color grading. 
I think the darkening of their hair reflects the development of their characters. For Sansa, the darkening of her hair could reflect the loss of her innocence, naivety and softness. For Mel it could reflect her ever deepening obsession with power and the evil means she uses attempting to obtain it. It's the minor details that go into this show that makes it such a winner. ","Yes, Melisandre. I thought her hair seemed much brighter when you first see her on Dragonstone, and at the wall her hair seems to be much darker. She says that she has more power at the wall, but she seems to be much darker, her hair is almost brown/black at the wall. 

Here are some links to footage as my evidence:

Season 2:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1OpEwhEMdc

Season 5:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM9Zg6M-wFc

This may be something minor, like the production team running out of Red #5 hair dye, but I just found it interesting how she went from a bright bright red color to an almost purple/black red color, and I wondered if anyone else noticed or thought it could be significant. ","Melisandra?
","With Mel I was wondering if it was a sign that maybe she is not on the right side, i.e. I wonder if it turns out that she is in fact working for the Other rather than Rh'llor without noticing it. I think it's interesting how Rh'llor is the god of light/fire/and all things good but somehow shadows are a part of him as well (the shadow babies she births) yet what does that leave for the darkness of the Others?","Carice van Houten said somewhere she uses the same wig since season 2. It's just that during post-production they give certain places a different tint, mostly to create a sense of temperature. Scenes in the North or at the Wall tend to look more colorless, while in the South or Essos they are more colorful. Both Mel and Sansa moved from the South to the North, so we see the a fainter shade of red in their hair.","What /u/E-Nezzer said. This is also evident when you look at her dress in a photo from the costume department, versus a shot of her wearing it in the show. There's a lot of detail you can't see due to the colour grading. ","Crazy stuff, didn't realize that it was the same wig throughout. Thanks for the info guys.","Also just started over again with a new girlfriend.  Only on episode 2, but a few things stood out that I didn't notice the first time around, or forgot:

1)  Daenerys always seemed small and weak in the early episodes.  Knowing what happens, it's pretty obvious that this is not the case.

2) When Jon meets Jaime, they shake hands, and the focus is entirely on Jaime's right hand.  And their conversation surrounds swordplay and fighting. Pretty obvious foreshadowing for him losing his hand.

3). Jaime is a DICK.  I forgot how much I hated his character at the beginning.  Smug, incestuous child murderer.  Yet he becomes one of my favorites.",I cant think of anything too specific. Mostly just quotes foreshadowing future events. In a big picture sense you really get the feeling that every single little thing that happened in se1 some how plays a huge part in later seasons. I enjoy noticing these little decisions and how they affect what you already know is going to happen. ,"For me, it was realizing each little thing that LF and Varys do to control the game. They are, to me at least, the smartest and most powerful people in Westeros. ","Man, I haven't gone through and rewatched the first two seasons since right before season 3. Pretty jealous since my family did it without me right before I came home for the summer.  

But like others have said, pay special attention to what people say. Knowing that some people will never meet again, pay attention to their parting words and feelings towards each other. Or pay attention to how people act if you know a dramatic change is coming their way.  

And try to ignore the changing wigs. Each time I see S1 Tyrion's hair I am completely shocked.","Listen to what Tywin Lannister suggests as far as battle plans and strategies. Pretty crazy stuff.
","I think re-watching, it seemed to me like Ned Stark knows he's doomed from the first episode and is almost resigned to it not ending well for him once Robert shows up.",Red Herrings. ,"LOL - I thought the same thing about Jamie when I was watching ES3 last night! 

The thing that's stood out to me the most was when Cersei tells Cat Stark about loosing her ""black"" haired baby to fever. It may have been the kings baby as it wasn't blond. I think she may have killed they baby. Thoughts? ","Dany still is small and weak. She relies on her advisors because she pretty much fucks everything up when she's acting alone. 

If it wasn't for her Unsullied and the dragons she'd be long gone by now - We've never seen her fight or anything.","They are the backend of it all aren't they - I wish they would give us some more insight into their ""little birds"" - I would like to see how that network works. But at the end of the day it's like D.C., the lobbyist are more powerful than the elected. ","Good advice! I forgot how boyish Tyrion looks in the first season. I was shocked both Benjen and Ned told Jon they would talk more next time they meet...Bum Bum Bum! 

It's fun to watch again - you should scorn your family for their dishonor and make them watch it again! :) ","I think the min [Robert] (/s ""is on his way to Winterfield he's in for trouble. I think it's because he's leaving his element, the battlefield or the North for the political wars of the city - he's not fit for that role and he's at a disadvantage."") He's too righteous and just to survive.
","I actually thought the same, that the ""black"" haired baby didn't die of fever but was poisoned, if not by cersei then perhaps by jamie or someone else","Walking into the fire with the eggs, prevailing in the house of the undying, and the trick she pulled with the masters of the unsullied were all her decision alone. In fact, she actively defied her advisors. I think you're selling her short.","Yep, I totally forgot about that until I watched it again.

>  
>After ambushing Daenerys’ fleet at Dragonstone, the Iron Fleet is sailing southwest over the bottom cape of Westeros toward the Iron Islands. On the boat, Euron is doing some twisted sex shit with Messindei. (I don’t like writing that). Cersei watches. She’ll throw anything at Euron to keep him off of her.

>The Mountain is guarding the door of Euron’s Captain’s quarters.  
>  
>When Euron is finished, he locks Missendei back in chains. He sits with Cersei and drinks wine that she pours from him. He romanticizes about the life they will enjoy together pirating at sea. He promises Cersei that she can still be a queen on the Iron Islands. The dead can’t swim, so they’ll be safe to “grow old, and fuck, and one day I’ll put a prince in your belly.”  
>  
>“There’s already a prince in my belly,” says Cersei.  
>  
>Euron laughs. Then we’ll rip it out and put another one in. You belong to me now.” He grabs Cersei by the face. “What power do you still think you have?”

>  
>“This bitch belongs to no one.”

>Euron collapses, dead. (We wish it could have been more painful).

>Cersei stomps on his face. She takes out all her rage against the Night King on his corpse. (That’s better).

>Missendei is shook (fucking white people). Cersei calmly walks over to her and caresses her face.  
>  
>Missendei shakes and asks “What are you going to do?”

>Cersei rises and opens a latch in the door. She whispers to a crew member. “Euron says turn the ship around. We’re sailing back East.”  
>  
>The Hound uses his new found flaming sword ability to roast a chicken. He shares the bird with Ser Beric (still healing from his many stab wounds, wondering why he decided to ride a horse for the last few days). Sandor saves a portion of chicken for Arya, but she’s off staring at the water.  
>  
>The Hound brings Arya a drumstick.  
>  
>“I know why you’re angry. You think you’ve lost something. But all you really lost was the time you spent listing fucking names.”  
>  
>“My list meant everything.” Arya’s so angry, she shaking. “No matter where I was in the world. I always knew where Cersei was. I could always see her face waiting for me in King’s Landing. Now I’m blind again. I don’t know where to go.”  
>  
>Sandor looks surprised. “You were blind?”

>Arya ignores him. “I’m not sure what there is to live for except revenge.”

>“If you killed the Mountain today, what would you do with the rest of your life?”

>Bran is now in a different raven, flying over King’s Landing. His raven perches and peers through the collapsed ceiling at the Night King who is in the process of making his own Kingsguard of White Walkers.  
>  
>The Night King is also having all the babies in King’s Landing brought to him to turn those little fucks into baby blue White Walkers.  
>  
>The Knight King looks up at Bran’s Raven and smirks. The Raven takes off. Not long after, the Night King follows, riding Viserion, flying up out of the Red Keep.  
>  
>Bran’s Raven is toast. He wargs out of the bird before it’s roasted by blue fire. The Night King continues his flight North, after Bran (He can still track the Three Eyed Raven with that magic handprint GPS).  
>  
>Bran regained consciousness in the library of Dragonstone. Daenerys and Tyrion are in the room with him. He tells Tyrion. “The Knight King is coming for me.”  
>  
>Daenerys presents Lightbringer to Bran. “Let him come.” The sword lights on fire in her hand.  
>  
>Bran asks, “Was it worth it? What you had to do to get that sword.”  
>  
>“Jon’s spirit will rest In peace knowing I killed the Night King on his behalf.”  
>  
>Bran admires the blade.  
>  
>“I have seen you kill many enemies, Khaleesi, but not once with a sword.”  
>  
>“Watch me.”  
>  
>Arya, The Hound, & Ser Beric arrive at the shore of the God’s Eye, looking across the lake at the Isle of Faces. There’s no sign of Jon, Daenerys, or the dragon’s.  
>  
>The trio find a group of fisherman and ask to borrow their boat. The fisherman tell Arya to fuck off. The Hound and Ser Beric ignite their flaming swords. The fishermen hand over the boat. The Hound tells them to give him their wine as well.  
>  
>Beric, Arya, & the Hound sail across the God’s Eye to the Isle of Faces in the center of the lake. When they reach the island, the Hound and Beric Light the way with their swords through the trees.  
>  
>Arya can sense they are not alone on the island. Something is watching them from the shadows.  
>  
>Arya finds Jon’s corpse. She rushes toward him. He’s cold as ice. She cries.  
>  
>Ser Beric looks at the Hound. “Bring him back, Clegane.”  
>  
>“Arya looks up at the Hound. “Sandor, please. Help him.”  
>  
>The Hound drains all the wine in his bota bag and kneels over Jon’s body. He holds his hands over Jon’s heart and begrudgingly performs the Last Kiss, breathing life back into Jon Snow.  
>  
>Jon gasps as he awakens (again).  
>  
>Ser Beric laughs. “You’re getting good at that Clegane.”  
>  
>The Hound wipes his mouth. “Fuck the Lord of Light.”  
>  
>Arya holds Jon as he struggles to comprehend where he is and what’s happened. (You got killed again for being too noble, you dumb asshole).  
>  
>“Arya... Wait... Where’s... Where’s Dany?”  
>  
>“She killed you,” says Arya.  
>  
>Jon tries to stand but he can’t. (Relax guy, you were just murdered for the second time).  
>  
>They make camp on the island to give Jon time to recover from his wounds. Arya, Beric, The Hound, & Jon huddle around a fire.  
>  
>“Dany is Azor Ahai,” says Jon. “She stabbed me through the heart to forge the sword Lightbringer in blood. She’s the one that the prophecies promised.”  
>  
>“Perhaps she’s not the only one,” says Ser Beric.  
>  
>Jon shakes his head. “It’s not me, Beric. It never was.”  
>  
>“The Lord of Light brought you back again, didn’t he? Just like he brought me back over and over. There must be a reason.”  
>  
>“I’m not Azor Ahai! Hell! Daenerys took Longclaw. I don’t even have a sword.”  
>  
>“Yes you do,” says Ser Beric. The fire engulfing his sword goes out. He steps forward and offers the blade to Jon. “May she be like lightning in your hands.”  
>  
>Jon looks confused. Arya helps Jon rise to his feet to accept the sword. He clutches his chest in pain.  
>  
>Beric gets down on his knees and peels apart his tunic, exposing his scarred bare chest.  
>  
>“You want me to kill you?”  
>  
>“Why not? You’d be doing me a favor. Time and time again, the Lord has brought me back, and every time I become less and less of the man I was. You can be the light to end the darkness, Jon Snow. The Lord of Light commands it.”  
>  
>“You and your goddamn Lord of Light,” says the Hound. “If you do this, Beric, I won’t bring you back.”  
>  
>“No, Clegane. I don’t plan to come back this time. Let me die a meaningful death.”  
>  
>Jon hesitates. “I can’t.”  
>  
>Beric’s not joking. He grabs the sword in Jon’s hands and puts the tip against his sternum. “Please Jon. You’re not killing Beric Dondarrion, just his scarecrow. Do it. For Westeros.”  
>  
>The last words appeal to Jon’s unflinching duty to protect the Seven Kingdoms. Jon howls and plunges the sword through Beric’s chest, forging it in blood. Beric dies with a smile on his face.  
>  
>When Jon pulls the sword out of Beric, he discovers it glows fiery red. The steel erupts in flames in Jon’s grip.  
>  
>(THAT’S RIGHT! THERE ARE 2 AZOR AHAIS. That’s 2 more than what we got this season).  
>  
>Jon, Arya, and the Hound cross the lake and disembark the fishing boat. The Hound and Jon use their swords to light the boat on fire holding Beric’s body. His floating pyre drifts off into the God’s Eye as everyone reclaims their horses. They ride east to rendezvous with Ser Davos, Tormund, and their armies as they camp before the march on King’s Landing.  
>  
>Ser Davos and the Northerners bend the knee before Jon Snow, Aegon Targaeryan, Azor Ahai, The Lord of Light. Ser Davos slaps Jon on the shoulder, “You are everything I ever hoped Stanis Baratheon would become.”  
>  
>Tormund greets Jon with a hug. “Snow. Stark. Targaeryan. Ahai. I don’t know what to call you!”  
>  
>“Jon will do.”  
>  
>It’s been days since any of the Iron Born saw Euron, and it’s starting to stink. They’re sailing east aimlessly back toward King’s Landing. Cersei finally exits Euron’s Captain’s quarters, dragging Missendei in chains. A huddle of Iron Born await her, asking what happened to Euron, demanding answers. She pulls a Captain Phillips and tells them “Look at me... I am the Captain now.” This doesn’t go over well, and a few of the Iron Born loyal to Euron charge Cersei. The Mountain cuts them all in half. That smoothes things over pretty quick.  
>  
>The remaining crew bends the knee. Cersei relishes their submission. Her crew asks, “Where do we set sail?”  
>  
>“Bravos. The dead may have no use for all the gold in King’s Landing, but the Iron Bank does.”  
>  
>Cersei smiles when the men set about obeying her orders. At last, she’s back in control (She thinks).  
>  
>We hear the roar of a dragon in the night. (Oh shit). Cersei turns to see Missendei staring off at the horizon.  
>  
>Missendei smiles and whispers a single word under her breath. “Dracarys.”

>Cersei has nowhere left to run. She takes shelter behind the Mountain as the masts catch on fire.

>Meanwhile, Daenerys is riding Drogon, shouting “Dracarys” until she’s hoarse in the throat. Her dragons absolutely decimate the Iron Fleet.

>The Mother of Dragons commands Rhaegal to swoop down close to the ship to scoop up Missandei out of the water. Rhaegal obeys and Missandei is saved.  
>  
>Then BAM a scorpion bolt sails right through Rhaegal’s neck. The dragon still spews blood and falls (with Missendei) into the sea and disappears. (OH SHIT!)

>The Mother of Dragons is horrified as she watches one of her children disappear underwater, dragging with it her most trusted advisor.

>She looks to see who fired the shot and sees Cersei behind the Scorpion. (Bitch, no you didn’t!)

(Somewhere Jim Ross shouts MY GOD HE JUST BROKE THAT MAN IN HALF!) The Mountain grabs Sandor’s sword and snaps it, then stabs Sandor with a shard in the shoulder.

>\- Whether or not Tormund or Ghost or Sam or Brienne or Podrick survive, Jon would ultimately be exiled and ride North to become the next Mance Rayder.

For all the rest, just pay close attention.","The first episode introduces the majority of characters you really need to know for a while, but it does so all at once in a giant clump. 

Honestly it's not super important to get every name perfectly, once you are through the first couple episodes it will all start to click.

I've watched the show with many people who know everything that is happening, but still don't know many character names. It's not very critical and the show does a good job helping you understand who is being talked about.",I watched the first episode twice because I was confused after the first watch but it all came quickly after that.,"Consider watching it with closed captions enabled - this way every time someone says a name you see it as well as hear it, and it helps it stick in your mind.

Trust me you are really going to enjoy it. Keep away from the internet till you catch up.

They're definitely worth watching (after you finish the season of course).  I think you can find most of them on youtube too, but I'd be careful to keep from getting spoiled by random comments or youtube titles if you watch them there.","Have fun! There are loads of characters, so don't worry if you don't remember everything that happens, maybe rewatch if you have time when you finish? Or read the books.",www.gotcharactermap.com,"As long as you pay close attention, you should be fine.  They do a very good job of introducing the characters.

The first time I watched the show, I used those after I watched each episode, as they tend to have spoilers marked.

It doesn't show anything that has happened in the show, but it shows what has happened before the show began (Lyanna and John Arryn for example). ","Derp.

Anyway, this question is more fit for /r/PureASOIAF than this sub and you'll find similar conversations just browsing that sub",Ok,"So, my dad introduced me to my love of sci fi/ fantasy/ any good story (had me reading Asimov and Tolkien as soon as I showed a passion for reading) but he himself had never gotten into Game of Thrones. One of our favorite shared novels had always been Ender’s Game (crazy because the author lives in my smallish city) because of how well the character development was written. I recently convinced my father to watch game of thrones before the newest season. I explained it’d be a rush having to watch it all in time but that it’d be well worth it. He was hesitant but I persisted and he was persuaded. He’s watched an average of three episodes since he started and I couldn’t be happier. He’s two episodes away from the red wedding(he currently thinks Sansa is expendable and robb is untouchable lol) and I have never been more excited. He has said he’s never seen a better story told since series he read in his youth. I’m so happy that this series can transcend age and genre stereotypes so well; no other story could possibly make you care about characters in such a fantastical universe as this. ","I think you're doomed, man. Almost every episode is NSFW, with few exceptions. Either gratuitous gore, or errybody's naked. And then some gratuitous gore, because it's GoT. Lol.

With any luck, he'll be like the rest of us and end up hooked before he can help himself, and able to look past the more objectionable parts.","DUDE, ENDERS GAME!!!! Not many people like it, but I love that. My dad watched the rerun with me as well. I don't think he's a fan of reading sci-fi, but he loves his movies and series. It makes for a good bonding activity. ",My gut tells me no. He is concerned that they're going to get distracted or even not make good decisions as a couple. Tyrion still knows how much Cersei hates him and wants him dead. Any deal he may have made with her is voided once Jamie let's her know she screwed them.,"If Jaime follows through with his betrayal of cersei, there is no way Tyrion will switch sides.","Read some theories (too lazy to go find them again) that he promised the succession of the throne to Cersei's unborn child, seeing as Dany is said to be barren. It was a pretty strangely placed conversation about how guilty he felt about his actions leading to Tommen and Myrcella's deaths (sounded pretty contrived/badly written, so may have been there for a reason) and then a quick end scene when he realized she was pregnant.  Then he saw Dany and Jon getting it on and if it turns out she can conceive, he will have fucked up big time.","He talked about democratic ways to transfer power in the same episode.  

But if Dany has a child that all goes out the window.... ","I dont think so, Jaime is on the way and there is ZERO reason for him to trust Cersei.","He's just being realistic. How else could he have come out? Happy? Smiling?

I believe he's concerned because he fully understands that Cersei is a psychopath and he's going to need to play a major role in taking her out.","Everyone is asing about what he said to her. But as I continue to ponder about Tyrion's final brooding I began to think about Cerseis cunning words. What did she tell him back ?  
 
 What if he was ready to play and she said something that triggers doubt. And this my lead to any reaction from him. ","Tyrion may have already betrayed Daenerys with his failed military strategies that the Lannisters countered as if they had the information in advance. And his ""kidnap a wight"" strategy lost Daenerys a dragon! I discussed this in another post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/73j32o/spoilers_s7e02_and_s7e03_a_question_about_battle/dnryw9x/",I don't think he'll betray Dany and Jon.  He still (i think) favors Dany far more than Cersei,Don't know if it matters. If Cercei is telling the truth she's probably going to die in childbirth right? ,"Maybe Tyrion has a simpler, less sinister plan than we've been predicting. Maybe he just told big Sis that if  she were to comply with the cease fire, he'd in turn advise Dany away from Jon. Separate their united front and meet Cerse's original demand of a neutral North.
This also fits really well with his vouyered reaction outside the door of their incestuous hook up. 

Also consider, we're being spool fed plot threads from       D&D and HBO on a much simpler and predictable level. 
Martin isn't even on this ride anymore which was very apparent all of last season. 

",This is a good theory! ,my theory is that cersei herself is barren and made up the pregnancy ,"Exactly.  Just like Cersei's pregnancy changes the board, so does Dany & Jon hooking up.  Potential (maybe) for Dany to get pregnant, but even beyond that it's just a major complication in itself. ","my dude, you do remember Jeoffrey, Myrcella and Tommen don’t you?",menopause dude,"She’s like 36, i’m pretty sure menopause starts at around mid-40’s",in the middle ages?,"Nope. In Season 4, Joffery called Jaime a 40 year old knight and some time has passed since then so I'm guessing 42/43 years.","A quick google search tells me it was about the same age as now. Hard to say, i’m no expert on the topic.",It was definitely rushed and forced. I’m sort of letting this one by in hopes that the rest of the season will be less so . I sort of expected the first ep to be like that,"I would’ve liked to see the reunions take longer and tease out the info about Jon/Aegon but we just don’t get to progress in the same way we did in the first 7 seasons because we only get 6 episodes to wrap ALL of this up. It’s a ton of strands to get put in order. I think they did the best they could given the circumstances. But I definitely get where you’re coming from. In a perfect world they get another 4 episodes to tell this story. Hell, I’d be cool with another 40!",It doesn't make sense that Danaerys allowed Jon to ride a dragon before she knew he was a Targaryen.,"I actually like that they got on with it. Everyone has been waiting for 2 years for John to know, and a lot of us knew before season 7 he wasn’t Ned starks kid. I was actually very relieved when they try to do the whole full circle thing linking it back to season 1 episode 1 and Bran is like “We don’t have time for this!” Whilst I appreciated the sentimental value, I’m happy that a lot happened in episode 1.","They're in quite the understandable rush. With a long winter and an army of the dead marching on them, there's a lot to take care of so they just don't have the time to sit down and tell everyone what's been going on.","Totally agree. It felt really rushed. But as someone already said, they all know there’s no time to sit around and chit chat, the dead is coming and they all need to prepare...quickly. Oh that and it’s only a 6 episode season. 🐺🐺🐺","Yep, I feel like it ruined last season and could do the same to this season. Everything just seems to lack depth. I would really like to know what the actual reason for shortening these seasons was.","From GRRM's perspective, the best case scenario is a narrative that is complete, but leaves a lot of loose ends for fans to wonder about for the next 5-10 years when the final book drops","I think there were definitely some questionable choices. We could have gone without that Jon / Dany dragon riding montage. It would have been so much more meaningful after the revelation about Jon's parentage, too. Could've gone with some time for Arya to explain that she's a teenage killer and Bran's a time traveling robot","I'd love a longer season, but if the producers think they can wrap the entire story up in 6 epsiodes, then adding any more would probably bog the story down. (Actually, they're wrapping it up in 5 episodes, since as your GF said, last night was just to set things up: letting us know where everyone is, and where their loyalties, and suspicions lie.) Other than Sam's reveal to Jon, and Bran's moment of eye contact with Jaime, there was precious little actual story there. (Okay, and Jon's awkward dragon ride was probably a major test, in which Daenerys either wanted him killed off, or proving his worth to her. He passed.) 

Yet there are SO many characters left for them to kill off, each could only get a few moments on screen for us to see where they are and where they stand.

And unless they start killing \`em all off in rapid progression, or have many of them together in single scenes, each episode will only be able to give each character a few minutes.",Yes it was rushed but rightfully so. The characters know the dead are here. There’s no time. They have enough time to regroup and get information out that is necessary. There’s really no time to sit and chat for a few hours or days. Lots of work to be done. I think this first episode is accurate and necessary. Lots was packed into just an hour.,We are actually getting 13 episodes. Remember they split the last season into two half’s. These 6 episodes are the second half of the last season. It’s feels like we’re getting less ripped off if you think about it that way.,"Considering the last season, this episode didn’t feel rushed to me at all. It was set at a perfect pace. I do wish some reunions had lasted longer than they actually happened, but maybe we’ll see them connect more in the next episodes.

These formalities had to be gotten done with to proceed with everything that’s really important.","I would have liked it if they had made each episode 90 mins like some of the BBC series. 

I think it remains to be seen if 6 episodes (if only approx. one hour each) is the sweet spot.","Only 6 episodes? That's news to me, bloody hell, I am definitely with you on this one as felt this first episode was a big let down.

Heck it exarceberates some of what I hated about the episode: so much useless scenes and filler. Like the last section with the wildings and NW, venturing into ruined forts for..reasons and then coming across a MESSAGE FROM THE NIGHT KING GIVING CLUES WHERE HE IS ATM. Caps because i feel the sillyness of that is a valid casus belli for nerd raging.

You could have removed this scene and it would actually have improved the episode for not making the NK look like some 80s cartoon villain leaving clues and taunts for the heroes to foil his evil scheme. 

With examples such as this I think I could have cut out half the episode to save time for other scenes.","What poor quality? I think the quality has gotten better. You see the detail on those dragons better then we had even seen before. We see how they gave Jon the sniff test to see if he was worthy. 

Everything has led up to this point. There isn't any new character back stories we need, we know it all by now. Yes, 6 episodes isn't enough, but you really can't drag out the wall coming down. Castle Black isn't far from Winterfell so the walkers will be at their door step in no time. Especially with a dragon on their side. 

The one aspect that did seem rushed/forced is when Sam found out that his father and brother died only to turn around and tell Jon about who his real parents were.",THANK YOU,Why?,Love will make you do some crazy shit? that's all i got lol,"It doesn't make sense if we see her view of Jon as some sort of teenie-crush.

It makes a great deal of sense if she was putting Jon through a test, which he managed to pass.

It doesn't make much sense if we view her relationship with Jon as romantic, as she could easily lose him.

It makes much more sense if we view her relationship with Jon as useful to her. She gave him no help, or even advice in how to ride a dragon; she simply told him to do it, and to sink or swim on his own. In the end, he'd either prove that he had an ability that most men won't have, or he'd end up dead and gone, and she'd find someone else more useful to her.

The relationship between Jon and Daenerys is packed with complexity, and like most everything in the past 7 seasons, probably isn't heading in a happy direction. Jon is sincere, naive, and struggling to do the right thing, if he can just figure out what it is. Daenerys is goal-oriented, worldly-wise, crafty, and is directing everything around her to get what she wants.

Viewed this way, what she did makes plenty of sense.","Thats a wierd way of saying the showrunners and key actors were ready to move on to other projects and source material dried up years ago.  But in all seriousness, im sure they would have liked to expand on things, they just dont have time.",Yeah I agree with this. But I just didn’t understand the point of Jon and Dany leaving everyone on their dragons for a little break when there are clearly more important threats looming 🤷🏻‍♀️,So true.,"I disagree. I watched the episode a second time and there’s a lot to unpack. Lots of events have come full circle. In my opinion mostly for Daenerys. 

They’ve shown how much power Sansa actually posses at this point in the story. 

Theon is making a comeback and setting up Plan B. 

Cersei is proving that she has very little power despite sitting on the throne. 

The death of House Tarly has come full circle with Daenerys telling Sam the news. 

The reluctance of the North to accept Daenerys and her own reluctance to prove herself shows that she probably won’t be the one to sit on the iron throne. She would rather force her right than earn the trust of the people. It’s going to bite her in the ass. 

We also get a hint of something Arya wants made that will probably be a life saver in the future. 

The dragon ride was a couple things. To provide proof to Dany of Jon’s lineage when that become known. I think it also proves her love for Jon and her quote may be foreshadowing one of their deaths (probably hers). 

Lots to unpack. It may not seem like much but my second time through the more information I picked out. It’s subtle and made to be the first episode verbatim but I think that was the point. Coming full circle.",The dialogue specifically. The character interactions. I have no doubt that the battles and twists at the end of the season will be great. Action brutal and detailed. But GoT has always been about the characters and their relationships and effects on each other. This season it seems there will be no room for anything that is not fast.,"I'm sure they would've liked to do more, too, but this was the plan since they trimmed the story for TV. MANY main characters were removed which thinned the storyline quite a bit, so there was never much room for more content.","I think it was a couple things. 

1. To further prove to the characters Jon’s Targaryen. 

2. Illustrate Dany is falling for Jon

3. Foreshadow one of their deaths. Remember, Game of Thrones doesn’t put things out there for shits and giggles. There is meaning behind it all.",I thought about that. I think they needed Jon to ride one because it’s going to play a big part in the ending. I mean he IS a Targaryen and that’s how they conquered Westeros the first time.,"Actually, we agree far, far more than we disagree. Almost the only point of contention would be how we define setting up the story, because almost your entire list comprises (by my definition) just ""setting things up: letting us know where everyone is, and where their loyalties, and suspicions lie."" By my definition, they're simply setting all the players up on the board, and showing either the direction they're headed, or (more likely) misdirecting us into thinking where they're headed. As a prime example there, we're led to presume that Bronn is now Tyrion's secret enemy. He may truly be, or not...

About the only substantial thing we may disagree on is the dragon ride. I think it proves the opposite of her love for Jon. She simply told him to ride, after clearly intending to give no help or advice whatsoever. The fact that he would fly or die suggests to me that it was a test, which Jon managed to pass. If she had any feelings of love, that seems a totally outrageous risk to me, but we'll see.

One of the producers has said that there is no Dothraki word for ""good,"" and that something that had positive qualities was called ""useful."" Daenerys has learned well, and Jon is useful to her. 

Jon is naive, and in many ways is Daenerys' opposite. He's learned from Ned stark to look for ""good"", instead of ""useful."" Like most everything we've seen in seven seasons, i don't think their relationship is headed in a happy direction...","> But GoT has always been about the characters and their relationships and effects on each other.

Very true and you're right, with only 6 episodes we probably won't get to see the relationships played in much detail. The quick interaction with Jamie and his sister was a bit too short for him to just pick up and leave.","The conversation between Sam and Jon in the crypt was so....blah. Like, that should have been a ground shaking moment for Jon. Instead he was just like ""K"" and moved on.",">This season it seems there will be no room for anything that is not fast.

This fits for the whole, ""There's an army of undead marching south to murder all of us, so we better be ready when they do"" them they've got going on, though.","It *was* a ground-shaking moment for him. He was literally taken aback and his love for Daenerys was challenged; you can tell a lot was running through his mind. It didn't let you see what he did right after that scene, so I imagine we'll see a lot of brooding next Sunday.","Martin is on record multiple times saying he would have stretched the show out to 13 seasons or something if they would allow it. 

I'm not understanding the directorial decision here. Yeah army of the dead is coming fits, yeah they are setting up the season, doesnt change the fact that this episode felt lifeless with a totally weird and anticlimatic pacing.",hey my brother and father are ded btw you are a \*spoiler\*,Stretching the show out to 13 seasons would be a complete disaster.,"I don't disagree that I would've liked to have seen more of the show, but that was never an option since they trimmed the story for TV.","His father forced him to join the Night's Watch *or die*; it's safe to say he might feel some relief in that one. We don't know how his brother felt about him, though it's implied in the books he also dislikes Sam. Yeah it's sad and shitty, but it's not like it was his mother and sister.

Besides, I'm sure we'll see a little more drama on it in the coming episodes.",Maybe but 2 more seasons wouldn't have hurt. Or even just 6 more episodes lol. Theres so much to unpack here.,"I think that Sam is the closest thing that the GoT world has to a conscience. He still feels love and loyalty toward a father who essentially said he'd surreptitiously murder Sam if he didn't join the Night's Watch. While we may have felt relief when Sam's father became a dragon-crisp, we judge the evil that was in the man, while Sam seems to have an unconditional love.

While I'd be immensely satisfied to see Sam as one of the people still standing (and even happy) at the story's conclusion, I rather suspect he'll make some sacrifice that turns things differently.","The problem is there isn’t so much more to unpack. They no longer have these massive books to draw from. They are trying to finish this story on foot notes essentially, and dragging that out another season or two is untenable.","Yeah, the story can be wrapped up succinctly in 6 episodes if done right (seems we're on the right track). It'd be strange for them to have more than enough time to prepare but people like >!Ned Umber!< are still dying because they ""didn't have enough time to prepare"" lol","Yeah I'm with ya. It's not too big of a deal to me, but it is a bit too orange lol. Jamie's hair has also darkened over the seasons too. In season 1 when everyone hated him it was at its blondest. But I noticed the more goodness we started seeing in him the darker his hair was became.
","There was a thread on this a week or so ago. 

[Turns out, that's not a dye job](https://winteriscoming.net/2017/07/05/lena-headey-playing-cersei-lannister-backlash-season-7-game-of-thrones/). That's the actual color of the wig. So, yeah...I think they are trying to make Cersei seem less ""pure"". ","As a blonde, I can confirm that the colour changes with the seasons, it gets darker in winter, lighter in summer, and I'd imagine a summer lasting many many years would produce some very bright blonde hair. It's either a costume department error, or some very smart and careful attention to detail, showing the blonde hair getting darker as winter closes in. Also, in the case of Cersei, having it all shaved off definitely would have affected the colour a bit as well, that tends to happen IRL as well after people shave their hair for charity.

","People nitpick the stranger things..But yeah, everyone's hair has changed, look at Tyrion from S01, all blonde, pure gold that hair was!

I think it might show the change from how the Lannisters held themselves in high regard, the darkening on Tyrion to be less of a Lannister and more of a ""Traitor to the Lannister name.  And the reddening of Cersei's hair could point to the blood that she has spilt making a more permanent mark on her character as a person and as a leader.","King Tommens hair Also became more orange before he died, so i dont think it has any meaning.

Also, where are the epic battle scenes?  Sure they cost money, but couldn't they show at least 1 or 2 a season?  Robb won three battles and we never saw them.

The fact that she triumphed over all that was so inspiring, and we realized there was something very special to her. But it feels like now, the creators of the show are trying to capitalize on our inspiration a little too much. Every scene with Dany is turning into an epic ""omg she is so badass and everyone loves her"" circlejerk, with sweeping music and visuals and tearjerking monologues about freedom. I'd love ONE of those moments in a season (like when she razed Astapor. That was pretty sweet), but with moment after moment happening it's starting to feel so canned and expected. I was really bummed that they closed the season with that Mhysa scene.

I think this can be explained by saying that Catelyn spent more time with the younger ones, or that they had a different tutor.","I just get past it by telling myself that maybe they had posh tutors. But I think I probably don't notice that particular accent problem as much as you because, as a Canadian most of whose friends come from immigrant families, I'm very used to people having very different accents from their parents. My own Dad is Italian and, although he speaks fluent English, I'm glad that my accent is nothing like his.

",[deleted],"As a Canadian who's very sensitive to the subtleties of both US and UK accents, I find it painfully obvious that, as good an actor as he is, Peter Dinklage is *clearly* an American trying to emulate a posh English accent, and failing.

That said, I must confess that I'm not familiar with Norwegian accents, and so I love Tormund's. I think I understand how you feel, though ... when watching Battlestar Galactica, I was distracted by the actor playing Colonel Tigh because he had a very strong rural Ontario accent, which non-Canadians probably wouldn't recognise.

GoT is one of the few fantasy series that I know of that actually has characters dealing with these issues.  And it's a bit more than a handful of strong female characters.

Chlidren pick up accents from their peers, normally.

And given that Jon Robb and Ned did not speak with southern accents, it makes it all the less believeable.

This is a good point: the Maester at Winterfell had a Southern accent, and so did their mother. Bran is very young when the series began, and *just* started being brought along with the men (when they beheaded the deserter in ep. 1).

They did not have to make the slaves/slavers/primitive, savage Dothraki brown skinned and middle eastern looking. If anything, I would say that the Dothraki are based on the Mongol hordes and should therefore look asian.

",Because ratings. ,"My dude, I pointed out earlier that there's no way a whole army can be wandering around in the North without Ramsay knowing about it. Do checkout the Westeros Map. There's a tiny passage called the Neck that connects North to the rest of the country. On the Neck is a castle (forgot it's name) which holds the gates of the pass. And Ramsay controlled that castle. ","They were stationed for some days somewhere in North (again, forgot the name), Littlefinger told Sansa. ",I'm sorry I don't understand. ,"How could she know the Knights of Vale will come? We just saw her sending a raven for help. Maybe they could have come far later, or not come at all. The blame still lies with Jon.","White Harbor, controlled by the Manderlys, bypasses Moat Cailin, the castle you're thinking of. House Manderly hates the Boltons and it's a straight shot from their lands to Winterfell.   
   
And the locals are loyal (or at least obedient) to their local Lords, not to the Warden of the North. So if they saw an army approaching their lands, they'd run to tell their local lord, the vast majority of whom hated the Boltons. None of the power the Boltons had came from loyalty, it came from the crown declaring them wardens of the North, and from the cooperation of 2 specific lords who hated the Starks and the wildlings.   
   
So the lords of the Vale landed at White Harbor, and the lords of the lands they passed through to get to Winterfell, Houses Manderly, Poole, and Cerwyn, all of whom were deeply loyal to the Starks, simply said to themselves, ""Good. I hope they wipe out every last Bolton man they find.""",Unless the Valelords took ships from Gulltown. Which they may well have done. We don't know. ,Bro I like how you took time to give a detailed explanation. But that simply is not the case. You just can't hide 2000 men and horses with flying banners. That's just not possible. ,"A few problems there as well. 
1- They don't have many ships. 
2- Gulltown harbour is very small for such an endeavour. 
3- An army landing on a harbour, there's no way Ramsay doesn't hear about it. ","Ramsay doesn't have spy satellites or a network of informants. The only way he would know there is an army approaching is if someone told him. And almost every single person in the North hates the Boltons, rich and poor alike.   
   
The only way Ramsay would know there was an army approaching would be if the Lords closest to the army sent a raven or riders to warn him. ""Hey, Lord Bolton, there are several thousand men marching through my lands making their way to Winterfell."" And every single Lord whose lands they marched through, Manderly, Poole, and Cerwyn, all DESPISE the Boltons.   
   
Not only would they not tell Ramsay, they probably helped feed and supply the army as it passed through.  
   
To give a real world example, during the U.S. Civil War, at the Battle of Second Bull Run, the union had no idea there was an army of 20,000 men approaching them on their left until they attacked them. TWENTY THOUSAND. It was a total surprise to them that they were even there.  
   
To give an in show example, the Freys had no idea Jaime was approaching their encampment with 4,000 men.","Bruh, Euron had a whole fucking fleet of ships after Theon and Yara took at least half and burned most of the rest. 

To act like we have any fucking idea of any house's resources or resource capability is ludicrous at this point. 

Just enjoy the show. ","Ramsay was not an ignorant man. Of course he didn't have satellite networks but I can't imagine he wouldn't have spies in almost every stronghold, or let's say SOME of them. And where were the scouts during the battle? The whole purpose of scouts is to watchout for any incoming forces.","Well you enjoy it if you can, brother. I certainly cannot ignore all this shit.","He DIDN'T have spies. At all. Spies require trust and Ramsay and Roose made absolutely sure no one in the North would ever trust them.  
   
The boltons were disliked well before the red wedding and full on hated after. Not only by the wealthy lords, but also by even the poor schmucks. The concepts of duty and honor run deeper in the North by a wide margin than they do anywhere else in Westeros.   
  
Anywhere else in Westeros you might find some of the poorfolk willing to circumvent their Lord and go directly to Ramsay to warn him for a reward, but not in the North. Both rich and poor alike HATE the Boltons in the North. No one would have warned The Boltons, especially if it meant going against the wishes of their local Lord.","I completely understand. 

Honestly I think the reason it doesn't bother me as much is because I have read the books.

Also I'd highly recommend reading the books if you haven't yet, it's like a whole new world. ","I didn't want to mention the books here but here it goes. When Theon captured Winterfell, Ramsay was there as a lowlife bastard, nobody knew who he actually was. He gained Theon's trust and went out with promise of more soldiers. Having half the men as Sir Rodrick Cassel, he still managed to kill him and defeat the stark force stationed outside Winterfell. This was just an example of what kind of person he was. Now in S06 he made some ridiculously stupid mistakes which are hard for me to digest, like using no scouts during the battle, drawing out all his troops leaving Winterfell unguarded and obviously remaining ignorant of a hostile cavalry force in his region.

If I'm correct in that assumption Barristan had plenty of time to travel what is a relatively short distance.
Daenerys on the other hand has travelled all over the continent, from the north-west to the south-west to the far east and back again all in the first three seasons.

She basically ends up on some quest to try to free a bunch of slaves, going up the coast of Slaver's Bay, with Westeros on the back burner.

Depends on how far back you want to go.  He really should have tried to bring Robb back into the fold before Blackwater like Renly was doing.  An alliance with the North could have secured him Kings Landing and then the situation would be very different.  

In the short term, letting all your supplies, horses, and siege weapons get destroyed by 20 men is a fairly large blunder, but that was enforced by the plot because they needed to rush his decision and because the show doesn't have the budget to do a battle with horses and siege this season.

>What are the odds of Stannis defeating the Boltons at Winterfell?

I'd be very surprised if Stannis outright loses.  Maybe the Boltons survive or escape, but in the end Stannis takes Winterfell.

The snow will lift and he'll have good weather, but I wouldn't expect much more than that.

",">What are the odds of Stannis defeating the Boltons at Winterfell?

Melisandre was extremely vague when Stannis asked about whether he would prevail.  She talked about very specific things, like having seen herself walk the battlements at Winterfell, etc. but couldn't say specifically how the things in her visions would come about.

""I have seen myself walk amongst the battlements of Winterfell. I have seen the flayed man banners lowered to the ground."" 

I think that will come about in some context other than the obvious one of Stannis prevailing at Winterfell.  I'll guess Baelish gets involved with the knights of the Vale, and it's he who takes Winterfell from the Boltons.  Stannis might not even be present when Melisandre sees the flayed man banners lowered.","I think stannis will annihilate the Boltons.  I think we'll see Roose and Ramsay getting ground into the dust.  Remember a few series ago the mention of a curse on people who betrayed their guests / people taking shelter under their roofs?

","Stannis' biggest mistake was believing himself to be Azor Ahai reborn.  It's going to be Mellisandra's as well.

Stannis could 'defeat' the Bolton's... but I suspect that the Stark sympathizers will take the opportunity of the seige and revolt against the Boltons.  I doubt Roose or Ramsay give that concept a second thought.  They're too hung up on everything external that they're missing what's right under their noses... The North remembers.  Sansa, a legitimate Stark, is in Winterfell.  I doubt there is a single person inside those walls that isn't sick of dealing with non-Starks.  They'll rise up and open the gates wide and proud for Stannis, and he being a man of 'honor', will grant the castle to Sansa.

2. I kind of already know how the Lord of Light helps Stannis (E10 preview)

3. I don't think that help from the Wall will arrive in time, would be nice to have a siege weapon in the form of a giant though (Wun Wun!)

I don't think that Stannis can take Winterfell with just forces from the outside, I think that Sansa will be a critical part, maybe she escapes through a hidden tunnel and stumbles upon Stannis and his forces or something.

I think Davos' trip there was only to get Davos out of the camp.  No help is coming from the wall and Stannis knows it. ","I agree that's what they implied but that same curse could apply to the Boltons, Ramsey in particular, because of his treatment of Sansa. ","I understand what you are saying, but I don't think that Stannis will just storm the walls. He must have some strategy to get inside, and maybe the Lord of Light shows him a way (Sansa hidden tunnel). 

In that context I think that the stories of Sansa, Brienne-Pod and Stannis will collide and the Boltons are going to lose, I hope, but we know GoT isn't much into happy endings.

The wall is very far away and Davos was only just send there, I don't expect any reinforcements. Don't forget that the Nights Watch can't send forces but only food and supplies.

You make a good argument for Gendry's claim to the throne but I respectfully disagree. Your entire argument is based on the king's bastard's claim being greater than the king's brother's claim and I feel that currently there isn't enough information to decide one way or the other.

",i haven't played since i started watching.   lost in lego games.,"What makes this one different is the characters and purpose, or rather possible lack of it. Let me explain:

From a writing perspective, Sansa is not written as a character anymore, she is written as a plot device. For four and a half seasons, she has done very very little for herself. She is abused by Joffrey to show us how eveil Joffrey is, she is saved by the Hound to show us he has some humanity, she is saved by tyrion to show us he is a good person who is willing to stand up to anyone to stop cruelty. Later, she is forced into a marriage she does not want by Tywin, showing us how Tywin feels about marriage, and what he's willing to do to secure a legacy; it also leads to showing us that Tyrion will defy even his father if it some to that (when he refuses to bed Sansa). Then, Sansa is saved by Littlefinger, showing us that Littlefinger might have compassion and humanity (or maybe not, who knows, it's Littlefinger) but it also moves the plot on nicely. Now, Sansa is in Winterfell where she seems to be once again, helpless. The legitimate problem many people are having is that she is written as a plot device, an object to be used by other characters to show development for them in an easy manner, or to further the plot.

In this case, it seems like the writer's purpose may have been to show us how evil Ramsay is (something we already knew), or to show Theon's breaking point (which we'd already seen he was close to, and could have been done another way). At the moment, it seems like the scene was just there for shock, and had no real purpose. That is the problem, it was rape just because that is shocking, which is frankly, disgusting.

However, that being said, the scene may have more purpose. It all depends on Sansa's reaction to the scene; if she recoils now and just becomes 'the victim' yet again, and has to be saved by Brienne or Theon, then the scene had no purpose, it was just there to 'shock' us. You could say it wouldn't make sense if it wall consensual and happy, true, but if they're not going to do anything with Sansa then why write it so that she's in Winterfell for this at all. 

However, this scene could have a purpose, making it a perfectly fine and acceptable bit of storytelling: if Sansa reacts to this by becoming a badass, and starts working to get her way, weakening the Boltons, doing what she can to prepare for Stannis, or whatever, then it's great because we will finally have Sansa acting as a character again, not a plot device. It's possible she already started this as many are saying by not fighting back at all, letting Ramsay have his way, quoting Cersei talking about a woman's best weapon being between her legs, and this could be true, but we don't know yet so we can't be sure.

To summarise, all of the disgust at this scene could be legitimate because it was just unnecessary for the writers to include it. However, it might not be, because depending on Sansa's reaction, it could become important and therefore have a great purpose and be good storytelling. It all depends, and we'll have to wait for the next episode to see really which way it falls.

That being said, I can understand the disgust at the moment, we're not sure, and yes we got the bath scene where Sansa might be stepping up; but we also have four and a half seasons of her being used as a plot device.

[S5E7-Preview](/s ""the preview does give me hope, as there is a scene where Sansa appears to conspiring with Theon, this looks like she is going to become active next episode and start working with Theon to bring down the Boltons; if this is true, then the scene definitely has a purpose and is fine storytelling"")","We barely knew Daenerys at the start of the show, but we've had 5 seasons to get to know Sansa.

Also, beyond killing a lot of people, it's hard to compare Khal Drogo and Ramsay.

Khal Drogo was just doing his socially accepted thing with his arranged wife. No malice involved.

Ramsay was making it as horrible as possible mentally while torturing Reek at the same time.

Ramsay is a special type of twisted.","I don't get this. It's not like the producers/fans/whoever were standing around cheering during the scene. It was supposed to be despicable, because Ramsay is a despicable man. ","I do wonder what it says about us as a society that we get so angry over sexual violence in this one scene, but we were willing to accept Theon's torture over an entire season. Why is sexual violence so much worse than other violence? Why didn't Theon's castration offend people as much as Sansa's rape?","I think part of the reason people are getting disturbed is cumulative: Daenerys gets raped, THEN Cersei gets raped, now--yay!--another lead character gets raped to move the plot along. 

And more to the point: the aftermath of those rapes was completely swept aside, as if they never happened (Daenerys and Cersie never even mention it.) When non-sexual violence happens, either the person is dead or scarred for life. It affects them. It changes them. Jamie got a whole season to get over hand, the Hound a lifetime to (not) get over his face, and Theon turned completely to a shell. It's not treated lightly, because this violence is meant to develop their characters, not the plotline.  But with sexual violence, the characters react as if it didn't happen, unchanged or ambivalent. Because it's not about them, it's just a device.

Could this be a way of developing Sansa's character? Maybe, but as others have said, she's had 100 horrible things happen that would change her, she didn't exactly need this 101th. ","I totally understand why those sensitive to graphic rape, something people have actually gone through, might find it disturbing. No one besides someone who's had someone murdered medieval-style in front of them really is predisposed to be sensitive to someone getting a sword to the gut.

For myself, it's more of an annoyed and frustrated eyeroll/groan. GoT asides, ""woman raped, gains agency"" is fucking tired and lame, and ""woman raped, causes some man to get revenge FOR HER"" is even more tired and lame. Specifically pertaining to Game of Thrones, this feels like a Steve Irwinish *""That's not a rape...THIS is a rape""* clarification from them that hey they actually know rape is bad, see? Also, it feels like they were like *""Hmmm we need to end this ep with a shocking scene... welp, time to go back to the ole rape well!""*

Daenerys was a spoiled little rich girl and we didn't know the character at all. I don't really think it was a great way to get her to become a strong empowered woman because basically the storyline evolves into ""woman raped, pretends to enjoy it to make the man feel good until she actually enjoys it and falls in love with her rapist"", super troubling in a lot of ways. However, Sansa has already had about 20 different horrific things happen to her and they already sort of have Littlefinger around to put out that rapey vibe. Yeah, technically the storyline can be defended in character because they've made Ramsay a one-dimensional psychopath. Congrats, GoT. Technically having someone kill John Snow or anyone getting killed or anyone getting raped is going to be excusable in this show, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to do it. Why not Arya, if anyone? She's the smallest. Why not Reek?

It's just fucking lame. Also, you can't ignore like this shit happens in a vacuum. Yes, the show is set in a medieval-like age, but the show is being made today by actual human beings. Unlike the real world, we know who the gods of creation are, and they seem to really love shocking rape and dragging out storylines way past their expiration date.","I'm not sure why so many people are freaking out over what happened to Sansa on her wedding night. It's was obvious when she agreed to marry him when Littlefinger first proposed it that she would have a horrendous weeding night. It's Ramsay for crying out loud; what did viewers expect would happen? I also think Sansa pretty much knew what she was getting into. The Boltons do have the flayed man on their sigil. Wouldn't a reasonably bright young woman raised in the north, who knows Roose Bolton killed her mother and her brother through heinous treachery expect that her wedding night with the cretin would unfold as it did? Sansa, like Littlefinger is playing a longer game at this point. I think she was willing to sacrifice herself to the monster in that way in order to eventually take big-time revenge on the Boltons. My hope is that the Freys aren't forgotten. They need to suffer for violating the ""you don't hurt guests in your home"" rule, if not Walder Frey cutting Catlyn's throat. By the way, I like the tv show much better than the books--especially the last book. I think it was a brilliant decision to put Sansa in fake Arya's place. As much as I hoped in vain that Sansa could somehow elude her fate at Ramsay's hands, I knew that realistically (in ficiton, heh!) she couldn't. I say bring on the next episodes and hopefully, a strong, determined Sansa whose desire for revenge will be keenly whetted by what she experienced.
",All I know is when Ramsay called Reek back into the room I was expecting the scene to follow what happens in the book. When it didn't a huge wave a of relief washed over me. Given that sense of relief occurred during a rape scene made me feel all icky and strange,"I'm very curios about the people that had such a strong reaction to this scene. Why was this the ""last straw"" as I've been seeing online and on twitter. I mean what about all the violence against men and women we have seen on the show? We even saw a casa de rape in Crastors keep.

I'm not trying to downplay the agency of rape, but if someone gave me the choice of having my hand cut off, being castrated, or some other form of torture, I would pick rape over it, prison style. My Reasoning is simple. One is permanently damaging the other isn't. Maybe I am just naive or maybe me being a male skews my view of the psychological damage rape can potentially have. This scene was much easier for me to watch than theon's torture, or oberyn eyes and head being brutalized. I love rewatching episodes of GoT but i have to fast forward these scenes often. Sure Sansa was raped, but compared to what some other of these characters have experienced, I don't fully understand, why THIS particular instant was the last straw. Is it just as a whole we are so much more desensitized to physical violence? would we be happier if Ramsay flayed the skin of her fingers instead?

Another thing to add, it would have been so out of place if she wasn't raped on her wedding night, it something that ramsay would have done as the evil bastard he is. I am actually glad they showed it. It means that they are not willing to compromise the integrity of show because it might offend some people. ",People got mad they didn't get to see the action. If it was on screen it'd be totally different story. Let's keep it real.,"Sansa wasn't technically raped, since she consented to the marriage with the understanding that in this era (modelled on the middle ages), the idea of marital rape wasn't even a concept.  She irrevocably consented to the sex when she agreed to marry him.  

I think most people would be shocked at how new the idea of marital rape is, historically speaking.

>The criminalization of marital rape in the United States started in the mid-1970s and by 1993 marital rape was a crime in all 50 states, under at least one section of the sexual offense codes.[101]

>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape#United_States", Sansa was pure!,"From my point of view it's the wild deviation from the books that cause distress. There is no political correctness in a Medieval Fantasy world after all and attempting to moralize the events depicted there are akin to the Government attempting to justify Water-boarding. In leaving the canon behind the Producer/Directors leave themselves open to all sorts of accusations about their motives, what's next? Product placement!","It was rape. Yes it's horrible but plenty of things in the show are. But I guess people are more ok with someone getting their head crushed in and say that was amazing but the other rapes and killings are fine. What did you think Ramsey  was going to do? I think people are more so upset because it seemed so real. Yet the people who are upset about this on the show probably won't go out of their way to help real people who have been raped in Real Life. I think out of everything that has happened to Sansa she has never had to go deal with anything on her own. This is the time unless she has brienne  help her. 
 ",">I mean, wasn't Daenerys technically raped by Khal Drogo?

Yes, and some people still did have an issue, it's just that the show wasn't near as popular back then. In season 1, there were under 3 million viewers every episode but the finale. In this season, the premiere had 8 million viewers, and it's stayed above 6 million. This show is pretty mainstream regardless of it not being made for the sensitive types, as you say.

I have not read the books myself, so don't worry, I can't spoil anything, but if you've looked around, you know the differences in the books and this storyline. 

And it's *because* of these differences that made that last scene totally unnecessary. There was enough change already that they could have continued to advance Sansa's storyline of her overcoming all the bad shit that's happened to her.

It was setting up to be a perfect case of her only problem being Myranda. It would have been perfect to make her safest place be with Ramsay of all people, which is what it seemed to be since she got there. Everywhere else wants her dead immediately. 

Sansa overcame the bruises & black eyes she got from Joffrey ordering Meryn Trant to beat her up because those are things that can heal back to normal. 

Personally virginity's never been a big issue for me, but I live in 2015 America. In GoT, a woman's virginity is a really valuable thing. Plus she thinks Theon killed her brothers and she has to have that happen in front of him. 

That's way worse than seeing someone's head get cut off, and I'm a dude with no ties to rape or sexual assault at all. I don't personally know anyone who it's happened to, so it's not a ""triggering"" issue. It's just hard to watch. Jousting and sword fights are not hard to watch.

Also, the main premise of the show is basically violence. You know this going in. You could easily go in and expect them to not show rape any chance they get.

I'll just throw this in too since I said it on the other sub.

All these characters use the bathroom all the time. Why don't we ever see them on the ""chamber pots"" every episode? Surely Tywin isn't the only one who has bowel movements. The answer is because it's not needed. We have a limited amount of show to work with, and we don't need gratuitous scenes such as the one Sunday. Just like we don't need to see a character taking a crap every episode either.

Edit:

Oh, also, sorry, forgot to add. Half of the issue a lot of people have is D&D's response to the scene. The way they talk about it is totally ignorant to put it lightly, and it's very clear there isn't a single woman writer on the staff from the way they talk. Pretty sure one of them said that this was something ""Sansa and Theon shared together"" or something cringeworthy and demeaning along those lines.","I think it's more personal for a lot of people than the other violent scenes. Most viewers haven't experienced being tortured, castrated, seeing someone decapitated, etc. but rape is sadly more common. The people I've heard getting angry about it aren't concerned about Sansa, they're upset that it reminds them or people they know of real rape. 

This should also apply to Danearys and Cersei though, and I don't remember as much backlash against that. ",[removed],"As irrational as it is, at least Drogo was sort of ""noble"", in a Genghis Khan fashion, so that when Daenerys found her place with him it was somewhat satisfying, whereas Ramsey is commonly regarded as a piece of shit with no redeeming quality. Even if Sansa, who elicits some sympathy from the viewers, somehow does the same, it will be icky. So, the sounds of her being raped struck a chord in a lot of people, and not a good one. Again, this is irrational, and an emotional reaction.","> The show is full of incest, slavery and cannibalism.

Yes, it i-- wait, what?

> cannibalism

Where was this?","> the writer's purpose may have been to show us how evil Ramsay is (something we already knew)

Then again if Ramsay *hadn't* done something awful, it would have been very out of character for him.

In theory, he could have done something non sexually awful, but that seems very far fetched for a wedding night.","It kind of gives Sansa a good reason to hate Ramsay as well, before now she didn't have a really good reason to hate Ramsay as a person. 

Just a thought, it could make her rebellion more personal, in fact after this scene I would like to see Sansa being the person to take Ramsay's head when the time comes.","I understand this viewpoint, but we literally haven't seen a single scene since this one. If Sansa just becomes a victim and this was just shock value, I'll be the first to criticize it, but I'm holding any criticism until I can actually see where they're going with it.","[Sansa - speculation based on interview comments](/b ""Sophie has mentioned in an interview that Sansa is a prisoner again but she's learnt to play people. Admittedly it's been a long wait but I think we'll see a big change and that this scene will be considered important for that."")",Tumblr feminists are stupider than a rock,"
>Ramsay is a special type of twisted.

You saying this means the writing and scene did exactly what it was meant to. Its not pretty, its down right deplorable, which is why its so great.

","But lots of terrible things have happened to characters we did know well (Robb, Oberyn); why has everyone reacted so extremely to this?",You have a point there.,Because everyone hated Theon at the time.,"Systematic torture like that would be a worse thing than the rape scene if both were real life situations. You are absolutely correct. 

However, I see this logic used way too much the last few days, because the glaring hole here is how real one of these things actually is, compared to the other one which is super, super rare.

And yes, before anyone posts links to people who have been tortured, I am aware it has happened. But it's not something the average person can relate to, and it obviously wasn't of the same magnitude Theon got.

Even someone who's never been affected by sexual violence, but who is still sexually active can have a strong reaction to this. It's not like it's a hard thing to imagine someone you know doing. I would definitely have a hard time believing someone I know is a serial torturer though.

tl;dr: rape is much more common than torture & castration.",Because Sansa is female.,"Dany never mentions it again because she created a strong relationship-- and even loved-- Khal Drogo before his end. She never has to go through anything she doesn't want to do ever again. Why would she bring it up?

What reason would Cersei have for bringing up her rape (is it really, though? it didn't seem to change much between them) again? ",">the aftermath of those rapes was completely swept aside, as if they never happened (Daenerys and Cersie never even mention it.)

Have you considered that ""rape"" being relatively normal in their world means they don't dwell on it as much? The others you mentioned - a hand cut off, face burnt up, and dick cut off have completely life-altering consequences, it's considered extreme even in the Game of Thrones universe. The same can't be said about rape, *especially* so if we're including married couples, where I'd imagine ""rape"" is quite normal.","I totally agree with you on them ignoring the consequences of rape. It didn't bother me so much with Dany, but I don't think they ignored it with Dany. She was clearly shell shocked from it and also used her to discomfort in general with her life to move forward and become stronger. You could argue using rape as a way to force a woman to become stronger is offensive or cliched, but I'd disagree since trauma towards men is also used that way in GoT.

HOWEVER, it's Cersei's rape where I really became frustrated it. It happened out of nowhere, committed by a character we are getting to like. The purpose of the scene seemed to solely be ""hey look, Jaime is still kind of a bad guy! But it's okay because it's Cersei."" And Cersei doesn't seem to react after at all. Her relationship with Jaime doesn't seem to change, she doesn't seem even a little affected by it. Why even include it if the characters are not going to grow from it? So it just seemed gratuitous, intended to shock and *maybe* develop the male character.

Who knows where they are going with Sansa's rape, but it could just be a repetition of what happened with Cersei.",~~Steve Irwinish~~ Paul Hoganish,"Moving away from medieval Westeros just for your understanding, that's...not how consent works. You are allowed to ""back out"" of consent at any point. (ex: A girl agreeing to have sex with you when you meet them, and them saying no when you're actually in the bedroom...that's not valid consent) Consent is also supposed to be given freely. Twisting someones arm into saying yes isn't consenting to it. (ex: ""have sex with me"" ""No"" ""You have to or I'll hurt you"" ""Okay fine fine"") 

Finally, consenting to one act does not mean you consent to sex, as you state. Agreeing to marry someone does not mean you agree to have sex with them, just as kissing someone or dancing with someone  or wearing revealing clothing is not ""basically"" consenting.

Ultimately, this is all relating to Sansa's situation. From our present day understanding, it's rape. Even from a Westerosi perspective, I don't need a link to the date of marital rape being passed to understand that Ramsay raped Sansa, don't give me this ""technically didn't"" crap. I think Theon's horrified face and the fact Sansa clearly didn't want it is proof enough.

I would highly suggest you read up on what is and what is not valid consent, not for the purposes of GoT, but just for your own present day knowledge. You do not want to be in a situation where you receive invalid or questionable consent in your future sexual encounters!",">Personally virginity's never been a big issue for me, but I live in 2015 America. In GoT, a woman's virginity is a really valuable thing.

Sansa accepted marraige with Ramsay, so that's who she's saved for. Did people seriously expect a romantic night with the guy? Or is he not supposed to have sex with her? Or even more strangely, do it off screen? That would have been absurd.

The only weird / shocking thing about the scene was Theon being present to watch. Otherwise, Sansa got exactly what she expected. The ""rape"" (our modern day definition) scene wasn't gratuitous at all.","""the production getting off on the idea of raping Sansa""

Do you believe the production gets off on male genitalia mutilation?  Considering Theon, Varys, and 1000s of Unsullied have all had their genitals removed/mutilated you MUST believe that the production team gets off on it right?

""The show has a history of sexualizing women and making them targets of sexual violence""

The show has a history of making men targets of sexual violence as well.  Unless you don't consider genital mutilation sexual violence. It's odd you're only offended by female sexual violence and are perfectly fine with male sexual violence.

""it was the tipping point that made it clear that wherever possible, the production team will make their female characters sex objects to be assaulted""

This was the tipping point?  Seriously?  Not Craster's Keep?  If you recall (if you actually watched the show) Craster raped his daughters and their daughters' daughters and their daughters' daughters' daughters.  That was the MOST horrific thing to ever happen in this show.  Nothing else comes close.  Certainly not this one rape.  I mean seriously how can you say you can handle hundreds of incestual rapes at Craster's Keep (most likely of underage girls), not to mention the murder of hundreds of male babies and yet this one rape of this one character is the tipping point for you!?  It seems you are only offended by rape if it's a character you know/care about.  That in and of itself is more horrific than anything Game of Thrones has shown.","The Thenns?

However, as I said, it's the writers who wrote the story that it's Sansa who's there, being abused by another character again. There are other ways they could have taken it (the book did not go this route). 

Once in this situation, this scene was inevitable, the problem is, why is Sansa in this situation? What purpose does it serve in terms of the story, the purposes it's served so far were served in other ways in the books. If Sansa now reacts to this scene and we get real action and development for her, then that explains it; if we don't, then it seems Sansa was written into this situation just for shock value.",Ramsay's family brutally murdered her brother and mom. I don't think she was on the fence about him.,"Yes but again, giving Sansa reason to hate is good, but not good if she doesn't do anything with it. I think she will, and i think we're going to finally get an interesting Sansa, but I can understand why some people are doubtful.

I made an analytical argument about how the writing of a character is bad... didn't even mention her gender once... she could be male or female or a fucking raccoon, doesn't matter, it's still bad writing in my eyes depending on what happens (haven't seen E7 yet, watching it later).

","Sad, but true.

The same reason people make prison sex jokes like it's nothing.","I would argue that rape has completely life-altering consequences, even in this made-up universe. It's just that it's not treated as life-altering for any of the characters who we're close to.

Yes, the show has a problem with its sexualization of women. I note that you didn't comment on that, just the targets of sexual violence part. The ""and"" in my sentence was important. 

To go off the point and respond to your complaint that men are abused: Actually, yes, I did find the prior abuse of Theon etc. as torture porn. The fact I didn't say it (because it's not in the episode which the OP asked to discuss) does not imply I agreed with it. I actually almost turned off the TV then. The other events have been building my position (the list of horrors you revealed.) The absurdity of this final rape of Sansa was the last step of gratuity. (I could comment on the books here but I'm unsure about the subreddit's general thoughts about that, so I'll leave that out.)

As for ""It seems you are only offended by a rape if it is a character you know/care about. That in and of itself is more horrific than anything Game of Thrones has shown.""--this is beyond ridiculous and unworthy of further comment. ","We didn't see any of it though, it's just implied.","> Once in this situation, this scene was inevitable, the problem is, why is Sansa in this situation?

The writers had to make a choice. In the books it is fake Arya that Ramsay marries. Introducing fake Arya is a lot of work, for not a lot of empathy. On the other hand you have Sansa, who the audience has watched from the beginning and are emotionally invested in. It seems to be the right choice. Especially if they are doing something GRRM is going to do anyway in the books, just without all the chapters.","My bad, I forgot that the Boltons organized that, even then what I meant was she has more of a reason to hate Ramsay himself. Not just because of what his family did.","Roose Bolton did that. And yes, she would have hated Ramsay by association, but apart from Ramsay messing with her at the dinner table, what has Ramsay done to Sansa to make her REALLY hate him in particular?  We the audience know just how sick Ramsay is, but Sansa does not.  She just met him.  

This pretty much ensures that she has a deep personal motivation to kill Ramsay the man, rather than just Ramsay the Bolton. ","That is true, though he was a pretty popular character. ","Haha what? Oberyn got his eyes gouged out, that wasn't a quick end at all
",This is a very good point. I can't actually think of any other characters who are generally liked or are 'innocent' that have suffered the way she has. ,"He should have worded it a bit better. The physical mutilation has a tangible, physical affect on the life of a person. The hindrance is objectively measurable, whereas with rape, the effects are psychological, and less obviously life-impeding to other people.

Additionally, it's possible for a rape victim to go back to functioning normally, depending on the person, whereas the same can't be said about someone who lost their hand or their genitals.","I wasn't attacking you.  I just read your comment and found it somewhat sexist and completely illogical.  So I commented.  The OP didn't specify this as a judgment-free zone.  You're backtracking a bit here but your first post was clearly talking about the violence against women in the show not violence in general.

""put off by the treatment of women"" ""the production team has some kind of obsession with women's bodies."" ""the production team will make their female characters sex objects to be assaulted"" ""the production getting off on the idea of raping Sansa""

You make it sound like the production team is a bunch of horny guys getting off on hurting women when they hurt men the same and even worst in many cases.  If you were truly against violence in general you wouldn't watch the show in the first place and you wouldn't describe the production team as ""getting off"" on it.

I don't buy the last straw argument.  It seems incredibly coincidental that you and so many others (this episode received a 61%on rotten tomatoes almost entirely due to the last scene.  The previous low was 91%) would all have the exact same ""last straw"" considering what happened at Craster's Keep.  There has to be something unique about this scene compared to Craster's and Dany season 1, that would cause an uproar here but not before.  The only thing I can conclude is that this was worst for people because they knew Sansa as a character but didn't know Crasters daughters.

I think it's important to talk about the role of sexual violence against men and women in TV.  But if the criteria for something being ""over the edge"" is how well a character is known or the character's gender then I think that gives a really really bad message about sexual violence.  That's what my last comment was trying (not so eloquently) to say.","But if Sansa doesn't react, if she continues to be a non-character, what purpose does the scene serve? If it doesn't serve a purpose, then it is just a gratuitous rape scene. They didn't have to show so much of it, unless they wanted to make a point or wanted shock.

And is it much more to just introduce a girl, and go 'this is fake Arya now'? Sure, we're not as invested, but it still shows us Ramsay is awful, and Theon is at breaking point, which is all the purpose this scene has served so far; until there's a reaction from Sansa, from a plot perspective, she doesn't matter, she's still just a plot device. Sure, people feel sorry for her, but what purpose does that serve if she still does nothing?

As I said, I think this whole debate will turn out to be for naught, as I think Sansa will have a reaction. But, I mean, to give a hypothetical parallel, imagine if we'd got a scene of Ramsay being really awful to Theon, pushing Theon to breaking point. Then, we'd got a scene of Sansa being raped by some random dude. So far, that achieves the same goal; Ramsay is awful, Theon is at breaking point, people feel sorry for Sansa. Yet that would be awful, because there would be no arguing that a random rape on screen like that is for shock and gratuity. However, if Sansa reacts, then the hypothetical parallel no longer works, as her reaction in the show will obviously be against the Boltons, and it will be her driving motive.

If the writers don't have Sansa do something, don't have her react in some meaningful way, then there was no purpose to that scene that couldn't have been done in a non-rape scene, making the rape just 'for the hell of it'.","Yeah, but he also paraded Theon out the night before, and her reaction wasn't ""Wow, this dude maybe has my back!"" but ""Oh. Awesome. Yet another psychotic husband. Lucky me.""

I mean, the Bolton's crest is a flayed man because their hobby is skinning people alive. She knew what was up before the wedding night.","I think that's because unlike many other characters, he wasn't up for taking shit and hated the Lannisters.  He also had an honorable vendetta so that gives people another reason to like him.  Plus he's a good looking dude.  Easy to like.","I just don't buy that rape isn't all that important in this GOT universe. When it is used to motivate men and advance the plot, it's **a big.fucking.deal.** Oberyn basically mentioned it every 3 sentences in his reasoning for wanting vengeance on the Mountain. Hell, wasn't the entire catalyst behind the last massive 7-Kindoms war the supposed kidnapping/rape of Lyanna Stark? A kingdom fell for that.

So, it's hard to swallow that for the men having it done to their loved ones, rape is an unforgivable and deeply horrific act deserving of their immediate reprisal, but for the women who are actually raped is more, ""Eh...nbd.""",">But if Sansa doesn't react, if she continues to be a non-character, what purpose does the scene serve? If it doesn't serve a purpose, then it is just a gratuitous rape scene. They didn't have to show so much of it, unless they wanted to make a point or wanted shock.

I am going to be honest. I don't agree with your perception and opinion that Sansa serves as only a plot device. Especially when it comes to GRRM main characters / PoV chapters. Having read the books, they come off as complex people with different agenda's, morals, ethics, etc... Sansa is a PoV character that represents many things, as is Theon.  

I also pretty much reject the notion it has no purpose but to shock. If that was the case, they'd just use a bunch of nobodies that we don't know or care about and do the same thing 10x over, pushing the envelope of depravity. But it's not about rape. It's about how vile and wicked Ramsay is. It's about how broken Theon is. It's about how brave Sansa is. It's about how innocent people suffer from wicked and powerful people. It's about life not being fair, and not having happy endings just because people are good, just or innocent.

The truth is it means something different to everyone. Including it being an unnecessary scene.


",So I'm a bit confused. Are you saying that the use of rape in the books was more justified than its use in the show because of the character? Is it not also a plot device in the book to make Ramsay look like a monster? How is this different? ,"None of those are reasons to hate Ramsay, though it's obvious she didn't like him.

What I'm trying to get across is that this is the turning point for her despising him. Not that she liked him before.",">Oberyn basically mentioned it every 3 sentences in his reasoning for wanting vengeance on the Mountain. Hell, wasn't the entire catalyst behind the last massive 7-Kindoms war the supposed kidnapping/rape of Lyanna Stark?

In Oberyn's case,

>You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children

The fact that all those people were *murdered* is obviously more important. Also, rape defined as ""consummating marriage"" is nothing like the brutal type of ""boogieman"" rape Elia received. This is why the 2015 definition of rape is useless in these discussions, because you end up conflating the two as if they're the same, when they're worlds apart. The former isn't a crime, it's tradition. Even today, some cultures hold the position that *you can't rape your wife*. The only fucked up thing about Sansa's scene was that Ramsay had Theon watch. Have people already forgotten how ready Sansa was to give her virginity to Tyrion?

As for Lyanna Stark, again, the issue there isn't merely the rape as it is the kidnapping being an act of aggression against a kingdom. Kidnapping someone perceived as valuable (to powerful families) is never treated lightly in this world, or do you think if someone kidnapped Jaime Lannister or even Cersei that Tywin wouldn't go to war over it? It's also dishonest to treat Lyanna Stark as the reason war started, because it wasn't - it took Starks being murdered (protesting for Lyanna) to start a rebellion.

Anyway, we can't use this catch-all ""rape"" term and compare one with another, when the situations are entirely different. Context matters. Elia's rape is incomparable with the rapes that have been complained about (Dany, Cersei, Sansa). As for Lyanna, we don't seem to know much about her or Rhaegar, so it's impossible to judge. I don't think I've heard Ned Stark complaining about Rhaegar raping his sister, though I could be wrong.","Yes, having read the books, they come off as complex because we get inner dialogues, I know that's not possible in the show, but they need to take that into account. The books are different from the show, whatever a character seems like in the books doesn't matter.

But we know Theon is broken, we know Ramsay is vile, and we have nothing to show us Sansa is brave yet. I think we'll get that next episode, but she hasn't done anything yet.","Because in the books, Sansa isn't being the victim yet again. My problem isn't with the rape, it's with the treatment of the character and the writing, and from what I've seen, this is many people's problem with it, it's just being drowned out by all the people that want to get offended.

In the books, it is a different character, setting things up differently, and showing abuse of this new character, in the show all that scene was from a writing perspective was 'Sansa gets abused again'. From a purely writing perspective, there is no reason for anyone to feel sympathy for Sansa, I know it seems awful to say it, but she's not written as a character, she's written as a plot device, an object. If it was a new character, we have reason to care because that's a character; we've had four and a half seasons of Sansa not being a character, just a plot device; with a new character, this type of scene is more acceptable (like with Danaerys) because it is setting a tone and establishing the character and their relationships with others.

I don't think I've been entirely clear, I have no problem with the use of sexual assault in storytelling, I have a problem with the writing of this; there is a good chance it will turn and it will all be worth it, however if it doesn't it is simply awful writing. This is the legitimate argument many people are putting forward, the problem is we're drowned out by the idiots who are apparently shocked and offended by rape in Game of Thrones.

But also, a plot device to make ramsay look like a monster? Did you think he was cuddly after he literally hunted a woman because she got pregnant? Or when he tortured Theon, and mutilated him?",">The only fucked up thing about Sansa's scene was that Ramsay had Theon watch.

No, forcing someone to have sex with you when they don't want it is still rape and still fucked up for it's own sake, ""tradition"" or not. If Sansa and Ramsay were having consensual sex and he made Theon watch, it would just be extremely awkward. The reason it was painful for him to watch wasn't that he sees someone he knew since childhood having sex, it's that he sees someone he knew since childhood being sexually brutalized right in front of him. And since Sansa had to actually feel that, it's still worse for her. ",">But we know Theon is broken, we know Ramsay is vile, and we have nothing to show us Sansa is brave yet. I think we'll get that next episode, but she hasn't done anything yet.

Perhaps I took the long way of saying that our empathy to the characters is what is important, and we all relate to the characters differently. You are being too analytical and intellectual to a scene that is meant to stir emotion. That is its purpose. If it was only about ramsay raping, they would have introduced fake Arya and had it done just like it was in the books. They did not do that because even less people would care about the event. So they did it with someone the audience cared about, that they were more emotionally invested in to stir and heighten the emotional response to the scene.

Does that make more sense? I mean it's very hard to argue against that. What you are trying to do is say ""well if Sansa doesn't do something with it, then it was pointless"", But how can that be true if the response we have now is the effect? I would say that the scene did exactly what it was meant to do regardless of plot and story.","I don't think the scene in question was problematic from a character perspective, and the sadistic nature of making Theon watch, was expected of Ramsay. It wasn't showing the rape so much as the impact on the victims. 

I just wasn't clear on your argument on why you had a problem compared to the book. ","It's marital rape. In the Game of Thrones world I doubt anyone would consider that ""rape."" Going along with the marriage, she knows she's obliged to have sex with him. Whether she wants it or not is irrelevant since she already agreed to marry.

Demanding sex was not the issue here. In these arranged marriages there's often going to be one (or even two) people that don't want sex, but will do so out of obligation anyway. The problem is how he clearly goes out of his way to humiliate her. It turned the experience into something much more horrifying.

Sansa herself knew she'd likely need to have sex when she decided to go through with the marriage. During her wedding night with Tyrion, recall how she even took the initiative of taking her clothes off. In her wedding night with Ramsay, however, when she's asked if she's a virgin or to take off her clothes, she immediately looks at Theon. The reason is because she wouldn't normally object, had he not been present - intimate husband-wife stuff is supposed to be private.

Basically, if Ramsay just told Sansa to take off her clothes, and had sex with her, without Theon in the room, there'd be no issue. Sansa was prepared for that much. Instead, the man who murdered her brothers is in the room as she loses her virginity, to her psychopath husband who clearly has zero respect for her. The betrayal of cultural expectations is what people should be surprised about. Not this rape = no consent silliness.","> In the Game of Thrones world I doubt anyone would consider that ""rape.""

When Tyrion told his father he wouldn't sleep with Sansa, he told Tywin specifically ""I will not rape her"". So it is still considered rape in that setting, at least by people who have some standard of human decency, even if it's ""tradition"". Go figure, the person who is always treated like a monster has the most humanity out of all of them. 

As for Ramsay, while we didn't actually see the sex on screen, it was clear from the sounds that he was hurting her. It's true that consensual first-time sex can be massively uncomfortable, even painful if the guy isn't gentle enough or if the woman is especially sensitive there, but it sounds clear that Ramsay is being rough with her, and I have no doubt he would be hurting her with or without Theon there. Though I do agree with you that Theon being there makes it even more deplorable and humiliating; I don't think anyone could argue that.",">When Tyrion told his father he wouldn't sleep with Sansa, he told Tywin specifically ""I will not rape her"". So it is still considered rape in that setting, at least by people who have some standard of human decency

Good point. I do think he's an exception, though, since he considers himself basically a monster to women. He's 100% sure that they're repulsed by him, like he'd be forcing someone to have sex with something inhuman. Almost any other man would have taken Sansa that night, even if she showed no interest.

Yeah, Ramsay went about it unnecessarily brutally and humiliating, no doubt about that. I was only trying to defend the act of sex itself, because it appears to be something people were shocked about. For instance, telling Sansa to take off her clothes and have sex on its own, I don't think is awful or surprising, since it's expected.","I noticed that, too.

The thing is that the distribution of time and overall emphasis were illogical. The writers should’ve been aware that e.g. having the Long Night play out somewhere mid-season would completely undermine its impact on the story. In addition to that, I think that Drogon destroying King’s Landing took approximately the same amount of time and it wasn’t even that necessary. Now I’m just speaking my mind and I’m not saying that my opinion is necessarily correct, but in my view - showing off all the CGI was a tactical move for the writers to lessen their own workload.\nCreating art is always a two-way street and the reception plays an important role just like the creation itself.\nI loved these characters like they were my own but in the end I felt nothing. Is it because I have no sense of logic and deduction? Perhaps, but I doubt it. It simply didn’t feel natural enough for a cathartic reaction that we had all expected. Hence the discontent, hence the outcry.']}","{'eq4vpqh': [1, 'Dany grew up fleeing from people that would have brutally murdered her.  She was a tool and a pawn, and sold off to Drogo, where she learned to be ruthless and speak with authority.  The Dothraki didn’t listen to her until she asserted dominance over them.  And when they all abandoned her because Drogo was injured, she was told it was because they followed power.  The slaver that she bought the Unsullied from didn’t take her seriously because she was a woman.  Nor did the slavers in Mereen, or the Khalasar.  In each instance she only came out on top because she asserted every ounce of dominance she had.\n\nThe seven kingdoms was an entirely different culture.  Power isn’t given to the strongest there, it’s given to those who call in favors.  Where Dany was from, executing prisoners quickly was a gift, because the alternative was slavery or torture.  Nothing she did before burning King’s Landing indicated madness, she was just following the customs she’d been taught.  In her experience, showing mercy had always caused problems later.  Executing the Tarly’s was not out of the ordinary by any means.  \n\nThe sparks of madness only appeared in late last season, when she met Jon, where she let her jealousy take hold.  That was disappointing because we are to believe that it was because Jon leaving her, when the relationship was so rushed it wasn’t at all believable.\n\nI don’t mind the Tyrion/ chair scene, because as you said, it shows his eagerness to be serious and do everything right, which was then completely destroyed by the humorless-sitcom like banter about the practicality of whore houses.\n\nThe scene with Bronn confronting Jaime and Tyrion had no value whatsoever to the plot.  It wouldn’t have been weird to see him next in the council room.  That time could have been so much better spent by showing Dany’s sanity crumbling, or Jaime oscillating between Briene and Cersi, or Jon and Dany interacting, or Sanasa and Arya’s reaction to learning Jon was never their brother.  But, nope, instead we got Bronn being uncharacteristically thick-witted by blackmailing Jaime and Tyrion.']}","{'ep81sva': [1, 'Yes, but she said he’d been kind when they were younger.  She even reflected back on the scene with the horse/ rape in horror, indicating that this was out of character for him.  He became more and more erratic as he got older and more obsessive about the throne.  What kind of sane person says that to his little sister?  His only emotions were self righteousness and jealousy, just as Dany was in the end.  It was all very “the ends justify the means” for both of them.  I think if Viserys has always been as unstable as he was he died, he couldn’t possibly made it as far as he did.\n\nIf we hadn’t seen Dany’s character develop so much over 8 seasons, she also would have been a very one dimensional villain.  Many people are upset that Dany’s character arc was destroyed by how she ended up, but I think her insanity was inevitable and that the actress behaving just as Viserys had brought her arc to a satisfying close.  I wish there had been more progression, instead of just flipping a switch from “sane” to “insane”.  When I first heard the “mad queen” theories I wanted it to not be true, because I *did* like Dany’s character so much, but now that I’ve seen the ending I can’t imagine it ending any other way.\n\nI would argue that Ramsay was also insane.

How do you deal with ramifications of the NK being defeated if NK death is last episode. You\'re basically asking for another season if youre insisting in NK\'s defeat being last episode. \n\nDrogon destroying King\'s Landing was to make Dany\'s decision to turn heel more acceptable. We had been shielded from seeing Dany\'s victims perspective, hence why a large number of people didnt think it was believable, but she randomly crucified 100 slavers, pulled a pretty Lannister-y double-cross when she ""trades"" Drogon for the Unsullied, or when she chose to kill random sons of mereen. She has shown a tendency to think in black-white terms, and it was  frequently the counsel of more level-headed characters that allowed her to see more shades of gray. And her obsession with everyone bending the knee was developed in parallel with her falling in love with Jon Snow. This did not happen over the course of 3 episodes, but we were distracted with Jonarys when it was happening. \n\nWhen Mad Queen first happened, i thought it was underdeveloped, but i thought it was pretty clear in next episode when they showed the courtyard full of Dothraki/Unsullied, that she had rightly inferred that she lacked the political support in Westeros to accomplish the regime change she envisioned, and she resorted to the same approach she always had: bend the knee or die.  So part of it was an emotional outburst/rage, but i think a big part of it was cold political calculation. Her typical approach of play savior, have everyone love you, be given free reign to dictate terms clearly failed this time around due to popularity of jon snow, arya. I personally think the emotional instability part of losing Jorah/Missandei weakened the character arc, or at best distracted from the truer motivation. It has creeped me the fuck out since she first started calling the dragons her children. The Starks have as close a relationship with their direwolves as Dany does with her dragons, and not one of them refers to them as their children/siblings. Dany has always inspired mixed feelings in me. As has Arya to be honest, but she sorted it out, Dany didnt. Each character has a number of other characters you can try to draw parallels with, and you come away with interesting observations of those characters. I think Dany comparing to Stannis for ""I deserve the throne"" and Arya for ""vengeance is mine,"" tyrion/varys for ""we can make a better world,"" and the Lannisters/Tyrells/anyone in Westeros for ""politics are always cutthroat,"" give the fullest picture of her. Like Stannis, her belief in her destiny drove her to commit pretty terrible atrocities. Her desire for vengeance was less consuming than arya\'s, and indeed, arya was the more death-obsessed one until she reunites with her family, achieves broad recognition as savior of westeros, two things Dany is denied _despite_ having contributed far more to the war effort. Hell, i subscribe to the Dany was a victim of Sansa\'s/the North\'s distrust as much as her own internal characteristics. I dont believe Dany goes Mad Queen if anyone in Westeros shows her a modicum of appreciation for saving everyone\'s asses, the people of Westeros _are_ different than those in Essos, and i think that plays a huge role. Ultimately, it\'s her sense of entitlement- a trait best demonstrated by cersei- that leads her to burn down king\'s landing the way that cersei blows up the sept. Like Cersei, she vowed numerous times to destroy anyone that got in the way of her attaining power. The difference is the Lannisters have insight into the fact they are selfinterested elitist assholes- and paradoxically- this awareness redeems their psychological state. But Dany isnt really a monster, is she? She has a compassion for the common person that Cersei distinctly lacks, and her inability to balance her ruthless ambition with her kind heart is why she gets twisted. She needs to be a good person in her own eyes (while Lannisters have numerous times described themselves as monsters), and so she develops what is ultimately a shallow rationalization that she is doing what she\'s doing to ""save everyone."" This lie she believes herself is why she is both a genuinely kind person and also a horrible monster. \n\nThe reason Dany as a villain works is because the viewer also believes in her pre-ordained destiny as savior, accomplished almost entirely by the music that plays whenever she was destroying her enemies. Dany is an amazing character, far from thinking her character arc was ruined by season 8, i think she\'s one of the most complex female characters ever written. \n\n\nAnyway, despite everything, i am mostly sympathetic to the complaints people have, it\'s just that those things didnt keep me from loving it. Ive rewatched season 8 episodes at a much higher rate than i have prior seasons, i honestly loved it\n\n\nIm sorry you felt nothing. I cried for Cersei/Jamie, Jon having to kill Dany, the Hound dadding Arya. And full blown wept for Theon, Jorah, Lyanna. I wept for Brienne preserving Jamie\'s legacy. These are all complex, flawed characters, and attempts to ""find a moral""/ message are doomed to be unsatisfying.  I am more than okay connecting the dots myself, the fans have demonstrated for more than 8 years ability to generate hypotheses/theories that are frankly as entertaining as the show itself. I dont know why suddenly we as a community have lost that ability entirely; we could piece together Mad Queen was going to happen, R+ L = J, but we cant fathom that Euron was hiding behind a fucking tall cliff. \n\nThere are lots of loose ends, and Dany\'s saga is over, but like, you know theyre making more spinoff shows, books, you dont think theyre going to be addressed?']}",{},{},"{'epbcf5l': [1, ""That might be true.

But what I’m pointing my finger at is the fact that this season turned into all-action when the rest of the show focused more on premeditation and the circumstances that drove certain characters to do what they thought was right or necessary. The second episode of the season was, to my mind, the last that featured any nicely executed dialogue which used to be abundant in the beginning of the show. I loved the point of view when Drogon burned down King’s Landing, I simply thought it to be unnecessary to take up so much time, especially when there could’ve been many other scenes that would’ve kept the storyline going by showing some characters’ lucid thoughts. If it weren’t for beautiful shots and incredible acting, most of the scenes that weren’t completely action-related would’ve been too cringey to even watch. \nHeck, they even had to use devices as old as time to give out a sense of finished story, including Tyrion (almost) breaking the fourth wall whilst talking to Jon, Samwell and ASOIAF and that awkward time-skip during which everything got magically wrapped up and fixed.  \nYeah, Dany always had a unique sense of justice, but it still is too huge a leap even for her to snap and kill the innocents after losing a good portion of her army to defend them just because she didn’t feel loved. I’m not saying it’s not enough of a motivation - it damn sure is - but it would’ve made more sense if those who actually took part in it were primarily affected, not the random innocents. I hoped to see her try to reign justly but face obstacles every step of the way because, let’s face it, peace doesn’t last (as Olenna perfectly said it in her soliloquy) and the people of Westeros would always see her as a foreign invader. That would’ve been a valid turning point for her since they would no longer be so innocent in her eyes. So much of it was left out that would’ve made the show beautiful and relatable on many levels when it comes to contemporary history. \nEach family represented a certain point of view, and their views were portrayed in that manner that however foregrounded, they had to be modified because they no longer proved to work. Some individual stories had a happy ending, some didn’t, just like it was meant to happen, but the simplicity which prevailed made me not buy it. Otherwise the philosophy, though cynical and nihilist, is pretty simple - cross the line, evolve and ascend, stay blindsided by your beliefs and they’ll crumble upon you. \nAlso, we as a community would be able to fathom Euron’s fleet ambushing and taking down Rhaegal if it hadn’t been till last season that we were even faced with the mortality of fully grown dragons. Yeah, they’re not indestructible, they do get hurt, but the only time before that that a dragon was actually killed with one perfect shot was when the NK took Viserion down. But that was different, we had to consider all the magic going around the NK and White Walkers and his supernatural strength. And there wasn’t one time that Euron (only speaking about the show Euron, I’m aware of all the differences in the book) was actually portrayed as someone with that kind of aptitude. Of course, we can say that anything should be expected (this is a dragon show ffs), but that particular act doesn’t exactly follow any principle of coherence, IMO. \nWe could go on pointing out the plot holes which were numerous, making jokes about Tyrion’s cock references and memes about Starbucks cups, but when the dust has settled, we will all eventually come to terms with the show the way it is and hopefully continue to address the main ideas and motifs that were the ones to make it great in the first place.']}","{'epdrvuh': [1, ""Hell no.

(Somewhere Jim Ross shouts MY GOD HE JUST BROKE THAT MAN IN HALF!) The Mountain grabs Sandor’s sword and snaps it, then stabs Sandor with a shard in the shoulder. Then he starts to drown his little brother. (It’s eerily similar to him forcing his face into the fire).  \n>  \n>Arya sees Cersei crawling away on the beach, but decides to intervene to save Sandor. She rushes forward, pulls that incredible catapult leap move she knows and plants her Valyrian steal dagger in the Mountain’s head.  \n>  \n>The Mountain throws Arya off and pulls the blade out of his own head.

He smirks up at Daenerys, still immune to dragon fire.  \n>  \n>He isn’t smirking long. Tormund and Jon Snow are running up on Viserion with a flaming sword. Tormund distracts the dragon with a screaming competition as Jon slices the dragon with the blade and the beast SHATTERS right before Tormund gets torched.  \n>  \n>Jon and Tormund share a laugh. They can’t believe they killed a FUCKING dragon.  \n>  \n>The Night King throws a spear that kills Tormund. Jon cries out for his best friend and charges the Night King. They duel.  \n>  \n>Daenerys is stunned to see Jon Snow is alive. It throws her off her A-game. She finds herself watching, not participating. She dismounts her dragon and draws Lightbringer.  \n>  \n>Arya has her back to the cliffs and there’s nowhere left to run. The Mountain is closing in. Arya thrusts out with her sword, needle. The Mountain bends the blade.  \n>  \n>He grabs Arya’s skull and begins to SQUEEZE. (Oh God no! He’s about to gouge out this little girl’s eyeballs).  \n>  \n>That’s when Sandor Fucking Clegane comes barreling forward and tackles his older brother off the cliffs. They fall together. The Mountains head smashes on the rocks below. He doesn’t get up.

He leaves with Ser Davos and all the victorious Northern / Wildlings, while the Unsullied / Dothraki march into King’s Landing after Daenerys.  \n>  \n>Cersei crawls along the beach. Her hands reach out in front of her, grouping at the sand. She touches a pair of boots and looks up. She sees Jaime looking down.  \n>  \n>Cersei cries and reaches up to her brother.

Also, rape defined as ""consummating marriage"" is nothing like the brutal type of ""boogieman"" rape Elia received. This is why the 2015 definition of rape is useless in these discussions, because you end up conflating the two as if they\'re the same, when they\'re worlds apart.

The only fucked up thing about Sansa\'s scene was that Ramsay had Theon watch. Have people already forgotten how ready Sansa was to give her virginity to Tyrion?\n\nAs for Lyanna Stark, again, the issue there isn\'t merely the rape as it is the kidnapping being an act of aggression against a kingdom. Kidnapping someone perceived as valuable (to powerful families) is never treated lightly in this world, or do you think if someone kidnapped Jaime Lannister or even Cersei that Tywin wouldn\'t go to war over it? It\'s also dishonest to treat Lyanna Stark as the reason war started, because it wasn\'t - it took Starks being murdered (protesting for Lyanna) to start a rebellion.\n\nAnyway, we can\'t use this catch-all ""rape"" term and compare one with another, when the situations are entirely different.
