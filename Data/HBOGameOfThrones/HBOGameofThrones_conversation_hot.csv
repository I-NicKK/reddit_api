0,18/20, 7/20. How was I meant to remember that?,20/20 woo!,nice!,maybe it is rewatch /re-read time :D,"perfect score, gratz!",The quiz hung onto the smallest possible details to be fair,I love the design but I can understand if they changed it because they thought he might end up having to fight Jon Snow.,Do The Sopranos instead,"If you do, stop at the end of season 6, when our queen sets sail for Westeros.","My wife and I are going through it, as she’s never seen the show. We’ve made it to late season 4. She’s hooked and I’ve told her how the show takes a downward slope later on.",As a fan of Game Of thrones I say yes,"After that, start The Wire. Best show I’ve ever seen, hands down.","Far better show with a far better ending.

It actually makes me kind of sad how my generation *just* missed the Sopranos when it first aired, and have enjoyed this golden age of television without ever knowing or appreciating the show that helped start it all (credit also to the Wire and Oz, of course). I know very few people that have seen it, and it’s getting harder and harder to get people to watch it - the second half of the show still looks great, but those first couple of seasons look pretty fucking dated now.",As a fan of Game of Thrones until season 5 I say watch half and make your own ending.,Excited! Can’t wait!,I just hope we see a legit full size Black Dread and not a rehashed Drogon,Meh. It’s over,"Looks like another series is still in development, however, so that's good I guess?",I read an article about this. I think they’re just delaying it. So nothing to worry about i guess,"Its still too soon in my pov. I mean they took years between seasons, i’d be okay with a reboot in 10 years, jm good right now.","The series called “Bloodmoon” made by Jane Goldman which would be set thousands of years ago based around The Long Night had its pilot made in the Summer and it’s this show that’s been cancelled.

“House of the Dragon” is a show based on the Targaryen family made by Miguel Sapochnik and Ryan Condal which has just had an entire series ordered. 

First there were four shows in development, then it was five, and then went down to three. With Goldman’s being cancelled that means there is still one other show still remaining that hasn’t yet been cancelled or ordered.","It's a prequel though, not a reboot. A show set 1000 years prior will have all new characters, plot, locations etc.",Wow 🤯,"Closeups, materials and progress pictures of the builds can be seen on his Facebook page, [Pete's Props](https://www.facebook.com/petesprops/).",This is amazing. I would like to know what qualifies as an improper build,Magical,"That would be a cool cake, I watch a lot of crazy baking cooking shows and my first thought was cake....he did a good job",Forgot I was still subscribed to this sub...,Yea but the whole room him and Cersei died in was mostly still in tact. Embracing ending for such great figures,"I agree, but I do think it was the right ending thematically, just executed poorly. Thanks for engaging with the post.",Gwendoline looks like Jesus with her disciples.,What are they wearing,Peter Dinklage!!! Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Woo!,Where is Lena Headey ;_;,Love Nikolaj’s blazer. So shiny,"Dang, is she really that much taller than Nikolaj?","peter did great this season, but imo alfie deserved it more",That was my first thought too 😂,Clothes,She was in that group but cropped,She's 6'3!,"Well, he's 6'2"", so there's something else going on here. Heels, probably.","This is flawless (and so relaxing)

**Edit:** And your pup definitely agrees!","Heyo! You guys liked my interpretation of Pod's song in here so thought you might like my arrangement of the Rains of Castamere as well. =)

I actually kinda feel like this tune could have been the main theme for the whole of season 8 since most of what I could think of when watching was about past days of glory that now were all but dead and forgotten.","That was fucking awesome. 

Don't happen to have tabs do you?",That took me way back to the good season ...gave me chills!,Even Ghost enjoys it! Beautiful music!,I very much enjoyed that.  Your guitar has a beautiful clear sound. Thanks for sharing.  That is such a great piece of music. Well done!,Welcome!,"Thank you very much!
He has to be pretty for the picture whether he wants to or not, haha","Ey thanks dude!
Sorry to say I don't :/ Always think about making them for my own arrangements but I lack some skill in the area and I'm also pretty lazy.... so...",Glad I could invoke some nostalgia =D,Thaanks!,"Hey really glad you liked it! Always a bit reserved with posting to reddit since many see it as spam but hearing things like this really makes my day =D

The guitar is fantastic and has probably ruined most other guitars in the world for me, haha","Well you definitely got the skill lol, but I can't judge on the laziness haha. 

But thanks for sharing anyways man. I sat down and figured out a little bit of it. Still need to get the high notes in there with it.","It's a super basic chord progression - Am, G, C and Dm for the first part and then add Em and F for the second. The pinch harmonics follow the same chords",The second guy from the left really is a good look-a-like  of Tormund,Dank.,Still a better choice than Jamie,Thats a really cool guitar,I could listen to this all day. Well done!,Beautifully done,"1. Beautiful rendition
2. You just reminded me to buy tickets for the Game Of Thrones Concert Experience",And really fun to play ^^,Thank you! =D,Thanks ^^,Thanks! Ooh I'd love to go to that as well and cross all fingers that Serj tankian sings the rains of castamere,I highly recommend going. I’ve gone once before and it was the best concert experience of my life,Love it 😍,Wow,I did not mean to watch the entire clip. Bravo,"Thanks, glad you like it :)",:),"haha thanks, delighted the video kept you watching to the end :)","I can’t tell which one is Sophie and which one is her double because they’re wearing sunglasses! Who’s who?

Edit: jk the ones wearing lanyards are the doubles lol",This is so trippy and kinda freaky,Are these stunt doubles or stand-ins?,It would be strange and telling to see who others would cast as my double.,Two Briennes! Mmmm,"I think Sophie is on the left.

The writing for the Game of Thrones tv show got worse after around season 4. The loss of consequence was a big thing that I missed from the books personally. But at this point, I'm sad that this is probably the only ending we're gonna get. I'd have loved to see how Martin played things out.

And now u are telling me this one is nominated 32 times, emmy’s judges really smoke crack or smth",Both the technical and acting aspects of the final season were excellent.,"You are absolutely correct. Haters must have been drunk every time they watched the show, because their common complaints demonstrate a very shallow understanding of the series.

Re: plot armor. The ""anyone can die"" gimmick of the early series was just a smoke screen by GRRM to obscure who the 'main characters' were. A series can be pretty dull if you know who's going to win from the start. Fact is Jon, Tyrion, Arya, Sansa, and Dany all had plot armor from the start, but since their stories were secondary up until the last 3 seasons, they never truly appeared to be in real trouble.

Noticeably, the 'everyone can die' gimmick slowed down later on because the smokescreen became less necessary as those characters were better established and their stories moved to the forefront. At that point, it was impossible to keep them out of trouble, because they are the primary players.

Re: writing. This is really just what they came up with when they couldn't figure out why they were so butthurt about the ending. People who complain about the writing often display a gradeschool understanding of writing themselves. They'll give examples, and you can rebut with concepts from intro to literature, but they'll just stick their fingers in their ears and shout LA LA LA CAN'T HEAR YOU LALALA BAD WRITING

Re: character development. People seem to think character development can only be positive and move forward. These people whine about realism but when a character develops realistically, with setbacks and failures and possibly never being 'redeemed', suddenly they want Disney endings. Sorry if this wrecks your view of humanity, but not everyone is going to live up to the potential you see in them.

Then there's the ""fOReShAdoWiNG iS nOT cHaRAcTeR dEvelOpMeNt"" meme in which the Dany fanboy ignores the increasingly wrathful would-be war crimes she commits, from locking people in a vault, to crucifying conquered people, to summarily executing prisoners via fire. To call those foreshadowing undermines the real actions she took.","I don’t think you’re observing things properly I’m sorry. 
The visuals, the acting, the cgi were the best I’ve ever seen in the whole series, that no one can deny that.
But saying this season didn’t suck is false, so you’re denying all the inconsistencies, lack of dialogue and everything else we loved about game of thrones being shat on or you don’t see a difference whatsoever? 
I can see you’re a fan of House Stark maybe you liked it because every Stark got what they wanted? 
I don’t mean to sound rude but I’m genuinely puzzled, saying it was rushed is an understatement it wasn’t rushed it was completely destroyed, even GRRM himself said there was enough material to reach 13 seasons even.

GOT ending was the biggest disappointment in tv history, that is the truth.","I liked it because the main thing I wanted was an end to all the questions and I, unlike some I did not have opinions on what the end should have been. People seem to think their opinion should be taken into account when making movies/shows, but the fact is that unless those people are on the panel of show writers their opinion means nothing. Certainly wasn’t a bad ending by any means and I’m sure they’re gonna get the end they want if they read the books. GRRM wouldn’t give away his magnum opus and maybe the trick up his sleeve is that his books will release when he’s dead so he can give it a different ending without repercussions.","Contrary to popular opinion, I too really liked season 8. Yes, I wish they had more time, maybe 10 seasons, but I read Kit wanted to bail a couple years ago and I think we got lucky that large of a cast, who got so popular and coming into fame stayed together for 8 seasons.  I’m grateful for an epic ending to an amazing show. Of course I had my own ideas about how I thought things should have been done. However, I just started reading the books and there are a ton more details and learning more about the history of Westeros makes things about the show much clearer. I understand the ending and it makes sense to me! Hopefully GRRM finishes the series and we all get the full detailed ending everyone wants.","Though I didnt had the patience to read the whole post, I agree with all the points I did come across. Nice post and it’s sad that well written posts with good arguments like this one cant get any acknowledgement and get downvoted a lot, just because of the opinions of sheep.",Forgot I was still in this group lol,-.-,Fam you spent way too much time trying to convince yourself it was a good end to the show.,"They delayed production for an extra year, so it definitely wasn't rushed. It was a meticulously crafted turd.","FINALLY! someone speaking sense here. Definately my point but in less words. Freaking haters just seem to have zero criteria about it and they just repeat exactly what they read online. When the fact is that the show's argument is something much deeper and much more than what their asses wanted. And YES man, realism in characters is not always redemptive and thats something people is completly ignoring. But oh well, I can die in peace now knowing I'm not the only one.",">  I can see you’re a fan of House Stark maybe you liked it because every Stark got what they wanted?

Well, every Stark fan except those on /r/JonWinsTheThrone.

Personally, I was OK with Jon not ending up on the Throne, but I also wanted his heritage to have more meaning than it did. If the books ever see light of day, this is something I think will have more payoff there. I believe Bran was to end up on the throne in GRRM's vision for the story (assuming this is what he told D&D), but I think it should have made more sense from both character and plot perspectives. Jon killing the NK would have been potentially acceptable, but Arya took that glory. I thought the Arya kill was cool and made sense for her character, but it stole what could have been a more satisfying end to Jon's arc. Arya's arc I believe should have concluded with conflict surrounding Cercei, Jaime, The Hound, and The Mountain, and wouldn't have involved her running off at the end. And it certainly wouldn't have included Cercei and Jaime dying offscreen.","Properly or not, like I said it is my opinion and I enjoyed the show to the max. On the other hand, GRRM never said it was a bad end either, he has never said he is unhappy. On the contrary, he is standing by the showrunners writing of the ending. I wish we got 13 seasons too, but I really like what we got.",">You liked it? Well you're wrong. It was bad and that's an objective fact.

lmao you're a meme","Totally agree with the first part you said. Probably  expectations where so demanding of what the ending should have been and a certain standard was being set. So, same as you, I watch the season finale completely open minded and like I said in my review, I got everything I wanted. I'm glad that I got to enjoy the show as a whole. Including season 8.","I'm gald you liked it too. I wish we got more than 8 seasons too. But there's so much we can do but to enjoy this great show. I haven't read any of the books yet, but I am pretty sure they are a whole new experience that expand the scope of the lore. Hopefully GRRM gets to finish his last two books and then we all can be happy lol","Indeed, I really wanted to get that out of my chest. I just refuse to believe that I am the only one who actually enjoyed the whole series from beginning to end. And it gets me angry to see people bitch so much about it just because others do the same, and the clearly  don't takeinto account many other things that I already explained in the post. It is unfair to criticize destructibly a work of art that took so many years and so much effort and dedication. I personally think it's a masterpiece and I will treat it as such.","/r/asoiafcirclejerk, /r/DanAndDaveFanClub, and /r/naath all have people who still like to discuss the show at some depth, though the former two are a little more preoccupied with countering reefolk narratives.","Hmmm never have i said that GRRM was unhappy with it, as far as I know he has been neutral to it all, never have I seen anywhere that he’s “standing by season 8’s writing” I highly doubt that. 
But if you’re happy with it that’s cool I like your enthusiasm","Exactly. Every time an episode came out me and my bro would smoke a joint and chill out. I think it was maybe my favorite season of all mainly because of how perfectly they did the winterfell battle, seriously it was more like a horror movie","Yeah, so many things got overlooked sadly.","I was hooked the moment Jaime pushed Bran out the window, lol.","I loved it from the start, but the scene that REALLY made me fall in love with the show was Tyrion's trial. Holy shit, that acting was sublime. It just got better and better from there.","I started to really like it when Catelyn arrested Tyrion, and his trial in the Eyrie was amazing.  But I knew I was 100% in it for the long haul when Joffrey made Sansa look at her father’s head on the wall, and she straight up almost murder-suicides the little shit.",Danaerys rising from the flames naked with three dragons,"When Syrio beat the shit out of 4 Lannister guards with a wooden sword... I’m convinced he is still alive, west of Westeros",When Ned took Bran to see him behead the nights watch deserter,Red Wedding.,"I mean, you look at scenes like this, and, well, most of seasons 1-4, and then you look at the clusterfuck that was seasons 7-8 and you just want to cry at how what could have been the greatest show to ever be made for TV turned into an overall solid 6/10.

Sigh.",The Death of it‘s first main character in season 1,You had to watch all the way to season 4 before you realized you were a fan?

I watched that scene and I was like “Wow.  So relatable.”,"Same here...Seeing Baelor in Season 1 though was what intrigued me.

I honestly wasn't invested at all until that moment and that CHANGED IT ALL,Yes that’s the one,"I never watched the show until one night I was over my brother's house visiting and he was watching this very episode. Since then I was hooked binged watched seasons 1-3, and never stopped watching. I'm currently rewatching the entire series and was reminded by this episode why I started watching.",Hol up,"I'm glad the actors and staff are proud of their work and enjoyed it. The quality of the acting and sets and costumes and *almost* everything remained top notch to the end. I can't logic away the huge leaps in plot and character development at the end that weren't fleshed out enough to feel believable, and that will always cast a shadow on the show for me, but I'm still a fan.","“I never particularly cared for” Nikolaj. Now then... give me something for the pain and let me die.

PS: I can’t fault the actors for trying to defend this dumpster fire of a season/ending. It must be terrible to see the peak of your career so highly, yet justifiably, criticized. Jaime was my favorite character, and I’ll never forgive what they did to him.","I feel like if ANY of the actors are taking criticism of the season as a personal insult to themselves or their work, they aren’t really understanding the criticism. Other than legitimate creative decisions, which can be subjectively perceived as good or bad depending on who you ask, the only major criticisms I’ve seen of this season is the atrocious writing/planning. It’s not the actors fault e3 was unrealistic and anticlimactic, they still acted their asses off and did a good job.

However a few of his comments on D&D are straight up lies. Talking about how they’ve worked for the last 10 years on the ending, worked their asses off and tried their best, when there’s tons of evidence to the contrary. Hell HBO wanted both s7 and 8 to be full length seasons but D&D declined. Until they caught up to the books 6 years ago they didn’t even know they’d have to think of an ending, so there’s no feasible way for them to have been working on it for half the time he’s claimed. 

I feel like this actor doesn’t understand the actual criticism at all, if he even read it. He only addressed a few minor problems that were impossible not to notice, such as the cinematography in e3. He didn’t touch on any of the real criticisms, like the Night King or HIS CHARACTERS developmental breakdown. I don’t have much of a problem with ANY of the acting decisions made in this season, but I have a huge problem with misrepresenting the criticism and lying about how hard some people might’ve worked.","I don't care who or how much it's defended, the reality is it's the audience who is right.  Like in standup comedy, the comedian stands there for 20 minutes and doesn't get a laugh, he can't say, ""I was really funny but they just didn't enjoy it.""   No, funny is funny based on the laughter you get or if you don't get it it's not funny.   So too when it comes to Season 8, they're never going to convince the fans that their reaction to it is wrong, it's real, that's what matters, not the marketing spin being put on it.",Queue the freefolks bitching.,"Easily the worst part of the season. I can understand Dany going bad, and... well honestly mostly everything else in the season. But Jaime going back to Cersai? Stupidest sh*t I've ever seen on the show.","The title is kind of misleading, I think he’s more so just defending the work that everyone put in. Like they are getting shit on despite the huge amount of effort they all put it. He’s not demanding people like it, just disagreeing with how people are going about criticizing it","I do agree with you point, but it is not always true. For example the comedian Andy Kaufman often got more anger than laughter. People hated him. But today many of those jokes and skits are considered masterpieces. He is one of very few comedians who ever got a major biopic made about his life.

&#x200B;

Other examples are movies  films, art or music that was praised or disliked when it came out, but has later become classics or as time passes it becomes considered  overrated  despite initial critical acclaim. 

&#x200B;

I will probably watch all seasons again in 15 years time, and I will have a better view about the quality. Until then I consider it somewhere between OK and Meh...","I see more people bitching about r/freefolk than anything else, to be perfectly honest.","He wasn't performing for the audience, that's the difference, he was performing for himself and his fellow comedians and unless you were in on the joke it was tough to get.   GOT is intended to entertain the audience, or are you saying that D&D just trolled the entire GOT fan base... I don't think so... David Chase's Sopranos ending was much more Kaufman-esque than anything D&D ever did.","Sorry if I was unclear, but that’s what I was insinuating. It’s a whiner factory over there.

Edit: I think I misunderstood my misunderstanding. Freefolks’ bitch which causes everyone else to bitch about their bitching.","Sopranos ending is a good example of an ending that has grown a lot over time. When it came out the main audience didn't understand it, and the media mainly talkshow hosts made fun of it. Today it is considered a masterpiece by many. Search for ""Sopranos ending explained"" on YouTube and you get hundreds of video analyzing what happened. Some of them made more than ten years after the show ended and the videos still have more than a million views. Sure, a lot of people still don't get it, but it is still a captivating the audience.

By all means. I don't think this will happen with GOT. But, it could have been a lot worse. A happy ending where the bad guys die, the good guys win and the hero gets his beautiful princess would have been a hell of a lot worse. And ending with everyone dying would not satisfy the masses either. Many wanted the dwarf to rule them all and people where in general picking sides like it was a sports cup going into the finals. It just had to end with most people not getting what they wanted. It was doom to make a lot of people unhappy. Does that make it a bad ending. No. Does it make it at good ending. Absolutely not.","I’m confused but here’s an upvote, whether you’re with me or against me 😂","When the Sopranos ended I was watching live.  And laughed and laughed and laughed.  Not because I was particularly happy that Tony was killed, obviously, but because I knew people wouldn't get it and freak out over the blackscreen.  Pure Andy Kaufman move like when he screwed with the V-hold on his special.  

Now as far as GOT goes, I have no problem with the ending but rather the rushed setup.  It wasn't laid out properly, it needed another season to get there, the quick Daenerys flip it was a handful of little things... when did Euron's purpose in life become killing Jaime Lannister?  As he was dying it was like he fulfilled his lifelong goal and before that moment we had no sense of that whatsoever.  Sure they didn't like each other but as you lay dying being happy that you took out Jaime just didn't fit the character's arc at that point.  I can break it down beyond that but there were a lot of little things like that.","I totally agree, but the uproar about the ending was really out of proportion.","The ending in and of itself wasn't the problem it's that it wasn't properly set up and to have that as the ending they really needed another season to flesh it out and make it all make sense, otherwise they should have went in another direction because of the lack of time allowed they didn't pay the ending the build up it needed or deserved.","OMG this..

Ridiculously long hours, physical exhaustion, working in extreme temperatures (Croatia in the summer, or Ireland in winter) while in a million layers of heavy fabric, spending a lot of time away from family and friends during a formative time in a child’s life, and sometimes having to put yourself through the wringer emotionally to put out a good performance.  And doing the same scene over and over and over again, both for the sake of getting a good performance, and just so they can reset the cameras to get a different angle or focus on a different character.

The moment occurred when Brienne sat down and wrote all of Jaime’s heroic accomplishments into the White Book, which put down in words that Jaime meant a lot more to history than just being the notorious Kingslayer. Djawadi set the scene to a musical composition titled “The White Book.” The score begins with the same melody Djawadi used for Robb Stark and Talisa Maegyr’s wedding in the show’s second season. That music was titled “I Am Hers, She Is Mine.”",Get those onions out of here!,Interesting!,Thank you!,I’ve listened to that piece so many times and I knew there was something I recognised in the back of my mind but I couldn’t put my finger on it,"Oh, this is painful.

As a side note, I hated this little circle pow-wow they all had. Not who they chose, but HOW they chose could've been better""**

OP. Consider this too. As Dany was never truly recognized or coronated as queen, simply killing Cersei doesn't equate coronation. Tyrion is the last living and oldest male descendant of the throne. As Jon continued to abdicate the throne as the true living heir. By Westerosi law of inheritance of the crown it would fall from cersei to Tyrion. This could've been true as well.","I think you don't understand the problem. There is nothing wrong with the story, storytelling is just bad.",That's exactly the point. The outcome is what geaorge rr Martin has told to D&D. But he didn't tell how to reach that point. So without building up the story D&D just directly came to that point with completely illogical and utter bullshit script.,"Yeah it's not the story. It's the way the story was told.

In the Last Watch there is a very moving last act detailing how the producers and creatives who have worked and struggled alongside each other for a decade come to terms with the realisation that they will be going separate ways.

I just wish I got the same feeling from the series...",The amount of mental gymnastics undertaken here that’s necessary to justify this ending simply proves how bad it was. TYFYS,"Yeah, most people (in my experience) don’t have a problem where where the plot ended but how the plot got there. 

Complaining about characters in a show not ending up how you wanted is childish and entitled and I don’t think that’s what *most* people are doing (there are definitely some). I do believe most people’s negative reaction to the finale was just in how it was presented. This is a show that used to spend several episodes/seasons depicting how a character grows, changes, and learns. Now we’re given seven episodes of some of the fastest moving plot lines at the most important time of the story and expected to understand the minutiae of character conflict and development when it was shittily written to begin with. Wanting a story that was previously told deliberately and elaborately to continue with the same method of storytelling is a very valid desire.","They skipped about a season and half to get us here.  

Foreshadowing is not character development.   

I'm sorry you disagree.   

It's about more than just rushing.  

They didn't show their work and the work they did show was bad.","The mere fact that anyone has to go to great lengths to justify each plot point and connect the dots is a clear indication that it wasn’t executed properly. We had to sit tight for 7 whole seasons only to have everything crumble right in our faces within the course of a few episodes. Having said that, she show could’ve lasted 4 seasons with the exact plot points if it being so rushed wouldn’t damage the overall quality - but the thing is that it would and this season is a living proof that it did. And also, if the point of the whole Azor Ahai prophecy was for Jon to kill Dany, I think that Bobby B might as well have been the prince that was promised since he was the first to vouch for the execution of the remaining Targaryens. Still, too much time and energy was devoted to the whole war of the Dead vs. the Living and, as Jon pointed out to Dany numerous times in season 7, the leitmotif of the story was putting aside the whole game of thrones and uniting against the common enemy. And someone who decided to risk a whole army and even her life to fight to save the people couldn’t just snap in one episode and kill them all. Jon who was the epitome of someone who got the shit done couldn’t be reduced to a side character with 2 lines of dialogue. Bran who possesses all the knowledge of the world (and should thus be in a position of power) didn’t deserve to be put there after all he had done with that knowledge turned out to either cause a complete destruction or have no impact whatsoever.","Interesting point about the people’s love for Jon being the tipping point of Dany’s madness, and how important it was to see how good of a person she was before she went insane, because that is exactly what happened to her brother.  Vicerous (sp?) went insane when he realized that he would never be loved by the people as well as Dany was.  If we hadn’t watched Dany change over the course of 8 seasons, her madness would be a retelling if her brother’s story, in that we feel no sympathy for the character and don’t understand that he was multi-dimensional.  In fact, the actress specifically mimicked her brother’s mannerisms and child-like excitement in her final scenes, bringing her character arc full circle.

The ending wasn’t bad.  Nor was the acting or directing, but we waited YEARS to see the outcome, and the lack of interest and effort by the writers really shows in the final season.  They dropped the ball and that can’t be made up for.  I mean, what was the whole point in the scene with Bronn confronting Tyrion and Jaime??  There was no point at all.  Why show Tyrion adjusting chairs?  Time was a very limited commodity in this last season, and it really shows how poorly it was used in the trivial things that were in focus.  This whole season was a giant “fuck you” from the writers, and that’s a shame considering how much effort was put into telling these characters’ stories.",I just wish they had shown us this. My problem is everything that happened that we didn’t see.,"I feel the same way about season 8 as I do the star wars prequel. I think that the bones of an amazing story are there that are really well put together and interesting and different. I just don't think it was executed very well. Senator plays both sides of a galactic war between robotic rebels and magic wielding warriors just to create an opportunity to seize power over the Galaxy? Fucking cool, let's tell it as a love story between a little boy and a Queen. Similar issue here. I think that everything you said is right on, and that many are asking for things that wouldn't have actually been better. I just think it was not done as well as it could have been. We just let it all play out when there were so many plotlines that we're left out that could have contributed and smoothed out this rough delivery.  Battle of Winterfell should have been better laid out tactically. Drogon should at least run out of fire at some point. Playing up bran as the night king or something like that could have made the ending so much more interesting. There's a fantastic story in there, even as currently delivered, and absolutely no flack should fall on cast or crew. They just should have taken more time to let it all play out.","I think you make a lot of valid points, and I agree that the ending itself, in terms of where all the characters ended up, was all right. The journey though, which some would argue is more important, was pretty messed up in the last couple of seasons.

One thing that does bug me is that people keep saying that someone who never wanted to rule might make the best king. Did we all forget about Robert? He never wanted to rule. He hated it. And he was not good at it either. Sure, there weren't too many wars on his watch. But he beggared the realm.","In spite of the dragons, the brutality, wars, assassinations, witchery, fantastical stuff etc. served as its backdrop, Game of Thrones is just a drama series with one clear protagonists, The Starks and antagonists, the Lannisters. The rest come as fillers for subplots that are carved into the whole main story. At the end of the day the protagonists will always triumph over their rivals. If we could live with that concept, we would enjoy the show, like I thoroughly did.","I agree 100%, last 2 seasons were hardly perfect, but the ending made sense to me. I’ll add one thing, Jon was Azor Ahai, the “flaming sword” used to banish evil ended up being Drogon. Just my view on it.","OP, I am way late to the party here, but I just wanted to thank you for articulating so beautifully what I have not been able to.","This post brought to you by today's sponsors, DnD",If you completely ignore everything from the first seven seasons and watch S8 as a badly written popcorn action flick then it is mildly tolerable.,"Thanks for the apologist fansplanation. 

None of what you discuss, however, changes the fact that without GRRM's dialogue and source material, this season was atrociously written and rushed.   

Contrary to that bullshit-just-read-Joseph-Campbell-for-the-first-time dialogue that sounds like the kind of nonsense you'd read on r/im14andthisisdeep/, there's plenty more powerful than a good story. 

In this case, it was bad writing that reared its ugly head and gave the series up to its flames.","I Agree 100%
I loved the story and the way (almost) everything turned out.
But the story telling was absolute shit that last season or 2.
I don't put all the fault on D&D though. They were complete newbies when the show started and they had a gang of talented and experienced people around them that could have helped. And GRRM himself is as much to blame for not having the material he promised, for the show to go off of.",*SUPPOSED to be as torn as she died,They should have just fired everyone and finished the last season with Muppets. They knew it was shite. The actors were ready to be done with it. The writers were already done and out of ideas. (Bollocksed it all up they did) And here this poor bastard is defending it.,"For the most part, i enjoyed it. Maybe some imperfections, but the story and characters was enough to keep me engaged, even with some of the rushed pacing","At one point I was like ""Am the only one who doesn't hate the ending?"" because there was so much hate for it, felt like needle in haystack, so thank you my friend for me proving me wrong. There were mistakes here and there but I also think that, it was the best ending.",Well said!  Not a perfect show but pretty close and so much fun over the years.,I'm not going to lie. I'm pretty salty about this whole situation but your brake down and explanation has made me take a step back and reanalyze everything. I guess I just had tunnel vision cause I was mad that Dany got killed. Thank you for taking the time to type this post.,"And don't forget for a moment that the huge tantrum started based EXACTLY on the plot points and where it ended up (thanks leakers). The crying took over the world before the final episodes  aired. Review bombings went backwards to other seasons and forward to episodes that hadn't even aired. Communities and subs swelled in ranks in the final week or two of the season.

The revisionist history from the hardcore haters is just covering for how embarrassing the emotional meltdown was. The NK didn't get a big flashy ending. No big sword fights for Jon. No pretty princess Dany. People were (and still are) trying to defend mass murder because they just loved strong lead Dany so much. No time travelling Bran episode (Deep down inside I would have loved this). Every single character didn't get a cheesy farewell to every other character they ever had a connection to.

OMG NOW WE HAVE TO APPLY THE GENEVA CONVENTION ONLY TO DANY. OH TURNING PEOPLE AGAINST THEIR LEADERS IS JUST AS BAD, etc etc. As those whines fell short, it just turned into nitpicking about how all of it just can't make sense. It does make sense. It's better than your fan fiction. The rest of us are a little down with how short it was. The magic of GRRMs character interactions and world building fell off because A) GRRM can't even come close to finishing his own series and B) World building takes a back seat to climactic finishes in almost every show and movie.

&#x200B;

I have plenty more on all these topics but this is lunch and I'm on a cell phone.

&#x200B;

TL:DR The haters are whiny overreacting cunts backpedaling to find better reasons for their despair and anger. Reasonable people can see a lot of the flaws in the last two seasons without it turning into an existential meltdown.",I feel like the frustration that has been sticking around the longest for me has been the conversation between Jon and Tyrion. I don’t see why Tyrion had to convince him to kill her. To me this goes against Jon’s whole character. He’s seen the things that she’s done and who she is becoming— he knows the right thing. Yet he’s still stuck on the whole “but she’s my queen” thing. Completely stomped on the integrity of his character.,I agree 100%,"There was a great post in the asoiaf subreddit that explained a lot. Gist of it was that it felt rushed and not make some sense was because a lot of the details were magic based that is not really translatable onto screen. The books thus far explain the warging abilities a lot better and its capabilities but harder to show on screen which allows those who’ve read the books to understand Bran’s scenes a lot better and what’s actually going on.

Tyrion resigned. And he was then being tried for treason. So he was not the Hand at the time of death, and as far as Dany is concerned, he wasn't even trustworthy.

So why exactly would Dany's army commander entertain his views?

As for the rest of your post, sure, a lot of the storyline *should've* made sense, but none of what you said had the intended effect on the author because it was rushed and put together sloppily. I see what they were trying to do, but the execution was so bad that we didn't see any of this.

I feel like I just watched a half finished product, the SparkNotes version of a show that had been sprawling and well told (at the very least, relative to the last 2.5 seasons).

I will also probably never be ok with how little we know about the Night King. His whole posse was useless, nothing about the Craster babies was ever revisited, I dunno, there's just a lot of meat on that bone. Same beef I have about the rest of the ending I guess, that one just bothers me the most.

OP did address this at the beginning but I think the point they're missing is that without that one *glaring* issue of the hurriedness and carelessness that the series wrapped up with, a lot of these perceived (in my opinion, actual) flaws are probably softened or entirely done away with.

By the end of this season, many people were left with more questions than answers and that's a major problem unless you're setting something else up which is off the table at this point. I've seriously never seen such a strong consensus on what exactly went wrong with a piece of media before. Most of the time when something is unsatisfying it's for a whole host of reasons, it's just nebulously ""bad"" or at least divisive.

I fucking love the show. The show has been a part of my life for eight years. I’ve sunk countless hours into reading the book series ~three times, in addition to rewatching the show. 

Usually when people are passionate about something they’re going to express happiness or sadness over how that thing develops and continues to change over time. I can absolutely love the show and still be disappointed that the writing took such a stark turn after season four. I can criticize how the show ended because I’ve been so focused on the entire buildup to that moment. 

Criticizing something doesn’t mean you don’t like it; it means you expected more from it. I am extremely happy I was able to be alive at the same time game of thrones was released as a tv show, and I’m not *mad* at how it ended; I just wish the quality had stayed consistent until the end, that’s a very reasonable expectation.",Lot of viewers apparently prefer to be spoonfed.,"Again - missing the point. I’m not in any way trying to say that you couldn’t easily wrap the story up and make it seem to yourself that it makes sense. The thing is that the distribution of time and overall emphasis were illogical. The writers should’ve been aware that e.g. having the Long Night play out somewhere mid-season would completely undermine its impact on the story. In addition to that, I think that Drogon destroying King’s Landing took approximately the same amount of time and it wasn’t even that necessary. Now I’m just speaking my mind and I’m not saying that my opinion is necessarily correct, but in my view - showing off all the CGI was a tactical move for the writers to lessen their own workload.
Creating art is always a two-way street and the reception plays an important role just like the creation itself.
I loved these characters like they were my own but in the end I felt nothing. Is it because I have no sense of logic and deduction? Perhaps, but I doubt it. It simply didn’t feel natural enough for a cathartic reaction that we had all expected. Hence the discontent, hence the outcry.","Dany grew up fleeing from people that would have brutally murdered her.  She was a tool and a pawn, and sold off to Drogo, where she learned to be ruthless and speak with authority.  The Dothraki didn’t listen to her until she asserted dominance over them.  And when they all abandoned her because Drogo was injured, she was told it was because they followed power.  The slaver that she bought the Unsullied from didn’t take her seriously because she was a woman.  Nor did the slavers in Mereen, or the Khalasar.  In each instance she only came out on top because she asserted every ounce of dominance she had.

The seven kingdoms was an entirely different culture.  Power isn’t given to the strongest there, it’s given to those who call in favors.  Where Dany was from, executing prisoners quickly was a gift, because the alternative was slavery or torture.  Nothing she did before burning King’s Landing indicated madness, she was just following the customs she’d been taught.  In her experience, showing mercy had always caused problems later.  Executing the Tarly’s was not out of the ordinary by any means.  

The sparks of madness only appeared in late last season, when she met Jon, where she let her jealousy take hold.  That was disappointing because we are to believe that it was because Jon leaving her, when the relationship was so rushed it wasn’t at all believable.

I don’t mind the Tyrion/ chair scene, because as you said, it shows his eagerness to be serious and do everything right, which was then completely destroyed by the humorless-sitcom like banter about the practicality of whore houses.

The scene with Bronn confronting Jaime and Tyrion had no value whatsoever to the plot.  It wouldn’t have been weird to see him next in the council room.  That time could have been so much better spent by showing Dany’s sanity crumbling, or Jaime oscillating between Briene and Cersi, or Jon and Dany interacting, or Sanasa and Arya’s reaction to learning Jon was never their brother.  But, nope, instead we got Bronn being uncharacteristically thick-witted by blackmailing Jaime and Tyrion.","Yes, but she said he’d been kind when they were younger.  She even reflected back on the scene with the horse/ rape in horror, indicating that this was out of character for him.  He became more and more erratic as he got older and more obsessive about the throne.  What kind of sane person says that to his little sister?  His only emotions were self righteousness and jealousy, just as Dany was in the end.  It was all very “the ends justify the means” for both of them.  I think if Viserys has always been as unstable as he was he died, he couldn’t possibly made it as far as he did.

If we hadn’t seen Dany’s character develop so much over 8 seasons, she also would have been a very one dimensional villain.  Many people are upset that Dany’s character arc was destroyed by how she ended up, but I think her insanity was inevitable and that the actress behaving just as Viserys had brought her arc to a satisfying close.  I wish there had been more progression, instead of just flipping a switch from “sane” to “insane”.  When I first heard the “mad queen” theories I wanted it to not be true, because I *did* like Dany’s character so much, but now that I’ve seen the ending I can’t imagine it ending any other way.

I would argue that Ramsay was also insane.  His cold disinterest was sociopathic/ psychopathic.  By today’s standards he would likely be a high IQ serial killer.  That’s what makes him SO evil.  The lack of emotion and empathy.

Joffrey was just an entitled little douche bag.","I can't speak on his exact quotation, but ik when the show was pitched to him, GRRM thought he'd be much further in his writing process by this time. He thought (and stated) he'd be done with the books years ago. I'm sure the plan was for the show and the books to be wrapping up at about the same time.
It is his fault because he owns the story and agreed to hand it off to TV producers when he clearly needed more time and less distraction to get the story where it needed to be.","* Wights can sometimes break through stone tombs, other times they're easily stopped by a wooden door.

In really any well written story every scene and every bit of dialogue should be realistic, make well explained sense and have a specific point as to why it happened pertaining to the conclusion of the story.
Some examples off the top of my dome:
For starters there's a graph floating around showing this season had by far the least amount of words per minute of any season. Big Red flag. 
It appears that a majority of the dothraki are killed by whites. Only a few run back. But several hundreds show up mounted on horses in kings landing. And why did they charge alone in the first place? 
How did beric block all those whites, getting stabbed and bitten all those times and end up running through the door 20 feet ahead?
The night king could have easily killed Jon snow but chose not to.. OK. But then he gets swarmed by thousands of whites all on him and magically next scene there's none around him and he's fighting them 1 at a time.  
Same with theon at the godswood. There's a whole army of them that wiped out all the dothraki yet 16 archers can pick em off 1 by 1 and they stop just in time for 2 main characters to get special scenes? 
And the story says arya leaps off a pile of dead bodies. But where was it? 
How tf did Bronn get past the thousands at winterfell with a crossbow into a room with 2 of the most important people in the country? And how did he reload that bow so fast? And what was the point of that scene anyway? There was none. 
How did Dany on a dragon not see the largest fleet of ships in the world? How did euron hit a dragon 3 times in a row from so far when no one could hit the other dragon when it was flying right at them? 
Jamie completely abandoned his arc of redemption at the very end.. OK. But when tyrion finds them burried in rubble under the red keep, there was clean floor 30 feet away from the bodies. Jamie and cersi could have taken 10 steps to the side and survived. 
Arya tries to help but as she is running through crowds of hundreds of people, suddenly everyone around her dies. Except a random white horse. Uninjured, clean, and calm. She gets on and rides off. How? Why? Her arc was done. She at the very least could have just continued running and the outcome would be the same. 
How come after Jon sees grey worm beheading pow's he immediately goes to find the queen; and even though Grey worm had several more throats to cut, hes magically in formation protecting Dany by the time Jon gets there?
Where tf was dorne this whole time? 
What tf was all the build up of the gold cloaks and the elephants? 

There's more examples if you watch through again. And yes ik there are ways to explain all these plot holes away but it doesn't make it right. I have no problem with the way anything ended up. It all tracks just fine if you try hard enough to follow the logic.

In theory it could be a great plot point. But it was executed so poorly that it doesn't matter if that's what GRRM intended or if it was a good idea in theory. Within the context of the show that we were given, Dany's story line ended terribly. It didn't make sense. It was not set up well. It was rushed and poorly written. Because it wasn't done right, the theoretical greatness of that idea doesn't matter, the end result is that it was a bad plot point. Same goes for nearly every issue that people have been complaining about. Arya killing the Night King and the whole White Walker plot point being a fairly easy foe is not terrible in itself, and with the right set up and storytelling, it could work, but it was terrible in context of everything that came before it. The way it was done makes it bad.","M’Lady, *tips fedora* /s","This seems disingenuous to me.

How do you deal with ramifications of the NK being defeated if NK death is last episode. You're basically asking for another season if youre insisting in NK's defeat being last episode. 

Drogon destroying King's Landing was to make Dany's decision to turn heel more acceptable. We had been shielded from seeing Dany's victims perspective, hence why a large number of people didnt think it was believable, but she randomly crucified 100 slavers, pulled a pretty Lannister-y double-cross when she ""trades"" Drogon for the Unsullied, or when she chose to kill random sons of mereen. She has shown a tendency to think in black-white terms, and it was  frequently the counsel of more level-headed characters that allowed her to see more shades of gray. And her obsession with everyone bending the knee was developed in parallel with her falling in love with Jon Snow. This did not happen over the course of 3 episodes, but we were distracted with Jonarys when it was happening. 

When Mad Queen first happened, i thought it was underdeveloped, but i thought it was pretty clear in next episode when they showed the courtyard full of Dothraki/Unsullied, that she had rightly inferred that she lacked the political support in Westeros to accomplish the regime change she envisioned, and she resorted to the same approach she always had: bend the knee or die.  So part of it was an emotional outburst/rage, but i think a big part of it was cold political calculation. Her typical approach of play savior, have everyone love you, be given free reign to dictate terms clearly failed this time around due to popularity of jon snow, arya. I personally think the emotional instability part of losing Jorah/Missandei weakened the character arc, or at best distracted from the truer motivation. It has creeped me the fuck out since she first started calling the dragons her children. The Starks have as close a relationship with their direwolves as Dany does with her dragons, and not one of them refers to them as their children/siblings. Dany has always inspired mixed feelings in me. As has Arya to be honest, but she sorted it out, Dany didnt. Each character has a number of other characters you can try to draw parallels with, and you come away with interesting observations of those characters. I think Dany comparing to Stannis for ""I deserve the throne"" and Arya for ""vengeance is mine,"" tyrion/varys for ""we can make a better world,"" and the Lannisters/Tyrells/anyone in Westeros for ""politics are always cutthroat,"" give the fullest picture of her. Like Stannis, her belief in her destiny drove her to commit pretty terrible atrocities. Her desire for vengeance was less consuming than arya's, and indeed, arya was the more death-obsessed one until she reunites with her family, achieves broad recognition as savior of westeros, two things Dany is denied _despite_ having contributed far more to the war effort. Hell, i subscribe to the Dany was a victim of Sansa's/the North's distrust as much as her own internal characteristics. I dont believe Dany goes Mad Queen if anyone in Westeros shows her a modicum of appreciation for saving everyone's asses, the people of Westeros _are_ different than those in Essos, and i think that plays a huge role. Ultimately, it's her sense of entitlement- a trait best demonstrated by cersei- that leads her to burn down king's landing the way that cersei blows up the sept. Like Cersei, she vowed numerous times to destroy anyone that got in the way of her attaining power. The difference is the Lannisters have insight into the fact they are selfinterested elitist assholes- and paradoxically- this awareness redeems their psychological state. But Dany isnt really a monster, is she? She has a compassion for the common person that Cersei distinctly lacks, and her inability to balance her ruthless ambition with her kind heart is why she gets twisted. She needs to be a good person in her own eyes (while Lannisters have numerous times described themselves as monsters), and so she develops what is ultimately a shallow rationalization that she is doing what she's doing to ""save everyone."" This lie she believes herself is why she is both a genuinely kind person and also a horrible monster. 

The reason Dany as a villain works is because the viewer also believes in her pre-ordained destiny as savior, accomplished almost entirely by the music that plays whenever she was destroying her enemies. Dany is an amazing character, far from thinking her character arc was ruined by season 8, i think she's one of the most complex female characters ever written. 


Anyway, despite everything, i am mostly sympathetic to the complaints people have, it's just that those things didnt keep me from loving it. Ive rewatched season 8 episodes at a much higher rate than i have prior seasons, i honestly loved it


Im sorry you felt nothing. I cried for Cersei/Jamie, Jon having to kill Dany, the Hound dadding Arya. And full blown wept for Theon, Jorah, Lyanna. I wept for Brienne preserving Jamie's legacy. These are all complex, flawed characters, and attempts to ""find a moral""/ message are doomed to be unsatisfying.  I am more than okay connecting the dots myself, the fans have demonstrated for more than 8 years ability to generate hypotheses/theories that are frankly as entertaining as the show itself. I dont know why suddenly we as a community have lost that ability entirely; we could piece together Mad Queen was going to happen, R+ L = J, but we cant fathom that Euron was hiding behind a fucking tall cliff. 

There are lots of loose ends, and Dany's saga is over, but like, you know theyre making more spinoff shows, books, you dont think theyre going to be addressed?","That might be true.

I agree with a lot you wrote but Gilly and lil Sam are there with Sam saying goodbye to Jon and when he hugs her he notices she's pregnant. They're also seen surviving the battle of Winterfell/The Long Night in the crypt after the NK dies. 

You forgot Varys' plot to poison Dany was vaguely mentioned but we're supposed to guess that's what his plan was. Also forgot Dany mean muggin' Jon when she leaves from her big Hitler speech at her army but later greets him with sparkly eyes just before he kills her. The entire council scene was awful at best.",[Here you go.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhWUFXvaZjo),Cersei was a coronated queen with no children or husband/king. Thus in her death crown would go to oldest living sibling. Much like stannis' claim which ned tried to make happen.,"I've always been unsure if legally Cersei would be queen in that situation, or if, just because all her rivals are dead and she was holding control, she just took the power and made herself queen. I always assumed the latter. In which case, combined with how unpopular she had been with the populace, she probably would have been viewed after the fact as an illegitimate queen?","I... I feel like that's exactly what I said with the ""story points good, storytelling bad"" thing.",there was a lot more to the ending than simply dany going mad.,"I personally agree with many points you made and I don’t argue the fact that they are all valid when it comes to the story itself. But what I’m pointing my finger at is the fact that this season turned into all-action when the rest of the show focused more on premeditation and the circumstances that drove certain characters to do what they thought was right or necessary. The second episode of the season was, to my mind, the last that featured any nicely executed dialogue which used to be abundant in the beginning of the show. I loved the point of view when Drogon burned down King’s Landing, I simply thought it to be unnecessary to take up so much time, especially when there could’ve been many other scenes that would’ve kept the storyline going by showing some characters’ lucid thoughts. If it weren’t for beautiful shots and incredible acting, most of the scenes that weren’t completely action-related would’ve been too cringey to even watch. 
Heck, they even had to use devices as old as time to give out a sense of finished story, including Tyrion (almost) breaking the fourth wall whilst talking to Jon, Samwell and ASOIAF and that awkward time-skip during which everything got magically wrapped up and fixed.  
Yeah, Dany always had a unique sense of justice, but it still is too huge a leap even for her to snap and kill the innocents after losing a good portion of her army to defend them just because she didn’t feel loved. I’m not saying it’s not enough of a motivation - it damn sure is - but it would’ve made more sense if those who actually took part in it were primarily affected, not the random innocents. I hoped to see her try to reign justly but face obstacles every step of the way because, let’s face it, peace doesn’t last (as Olenna perfectly said it in her soliloquy) and the people of Westeros would always see her as a foreign invader. That would’ve been a valid turning point for her since they would no longer be so innocent in her eyes. So much of it was left out that would’ve made the show beautiful and relatable on many levels when it comes to contemporary history. 
Each family represented a certain point of view, and their views were portrayed in that manner that however foregrounded, they had to be modified because they no longer proved to work. Some individual stories had a happy ending, some didn’t, just like it was meant to happen, but the simplicity which prevailed made me not buy it. Otherwise the philosophy, though cynical and nihilist, is pretty simple - cross the line, evolve and ascend, stay blindsided by your beliefs and they’ll crumble upon you. 
Also, we as a community would be able to fathom Euron’s fleet ambushing and taking down Rhaegal if it hadn’t been till last season that we were even faced with the mortality of fully grown dragons. Yeah, they’re not indestructible, they do get hurt, but the only time before that that a dragon was actually killed with one perfect shot was when the NK took Viserion down. But that was different, we had to consider all the magic going around the NK and White Walkers and his supernatural strength. And there wasn’t one time that Euron (only speaking about the show Euron, I’m aware of all the differences in the book) was actually portrayed as someone with that kind of aptitude. Of course, we can say that anything should be expected (this is a dragon show ffs), but that particular act doesn’t exactly follow any principle of coherence, IMO. 
We could go on pointing out the plot holes which were numerous, making jokes about Tyrion’s cock references and memes about Starbucks cups, but when the dust has settled, we will all eventually come to terms with the show the way it is and hopefully continue to address the main ideas and motifs that were the ones to make it great in the first place.",Hell no. I'm the worst procrastinator. But I never got paid dick to write either. But I do always keep my word to the people signing my checks.,">Gilly and lil Sam are there with Sam saying goodbye to Jon and when he hugs her he notices she's pregnant. They're also seen surviving the battle of Winterfell/The Long Night in the crypt after the NK dies.

Fair enough, I guess I kinda forgot those things happened.",Lol cheeky,Ok. That gets messy but I can see your point.,"But in the end the story points weren't actually good. Had they been handled differently, I supposed they  could have been good, buy what we were given were bad story points.","> I hoped to see her try to reign justly but face obstacles every step of the way because, let’s face it, peace doesn’t last (as Olenna perfectly said it in her soliloquy) and the people of Westeros would always see her as a foreign invader.

For me this already happened when she was queen in the east and she was facing obstacles (sons of the harpy for example).  there is one episode that I don't remember which, when someone says se ""is a conqueror"". When she was in Meereen she didn't want to sit and rule, she wanted to conquer more places and ""free the slaves"". she said at the end when they got kind's landing, she was going to other places to ""liberate people from tyranny"" or burn them all if they don't accept her as queen (what for me is tyranny too).",Haha yea I love seeing a smart character reduced to cock jokes!!!!,“Roasting”,"“Goodbye,old friend.”",I needed this after watching eps4-6, Brilliant!

Edit: Was blind but now I can see.  I spotted that golden hand.",Bran looking fucking stoned,"Who is hugging Jaime? Who is the man with the card above them?
Why is Ned only wearing one glove?",Bran chilling with his crows. I can’t 😂😂,"I love it! Although there are a few I am not sure I recognize correctly. Who is Sansa hugging? Robb? (I assume that's Grey Wind licking his face?) Who is the guy Brienne's hand is on? Is it Davos? Because I thought the one on his right was Davos but it might be Stannis.

And finally, who is that girl on the right, with the blue dress? And the guy on her left? Is that Yara/Asha at her right?

And who's the guy with the red card next to Missandei?",Why is Cersei on the throne??,"Stanis looks like Davos and Davos looks like Craster... : D

Wher is Beric and Thoros though ?! Two of the coolest characters.

It's a good effort but a few in there that shouldn't be ahead of others...but what do I know ?","I'm sure in this sub I'll just be downboted to oblivion. You guys are the same ones defending the last season right? Lmao. I guess it's no surprise you think this is good art too. This is a repost from last night though, and I will leave my same comment here:

&#x200B;

>I like the concept but the execution is lacking. I mean I like the style or whatever, but it's pretty hard to distinguish who everybody even is. The artist didn't do a great job of capturing each character imo.

&#x200B;

It's perfectly okay to not drool and praise over every single thing that is GoT related.

Art is subjective. What's ""awesome"" to somebody is pretty terrible to somebody else. You can't please everybody. In My opinion this is pretty low effort. .....But hey! They filled up the whole page like a good little first-grader, AND used a highly popular concept everybody is super hyped about already so....""awesome"" job? SMH.

""This is awesome"" ...probably the same people who said the same thing about S7 and S8. SMH.

&#x200B;

EDIT- There are many more out there with this same exact concept. Do a quick Google search and you will see what I mean. Anybody who think this particular one is ""awesome"" is fucking delusional, I'm sorry. The artist captured nobody's ambience or feeling or aura. ""Is that... ???"" or is supposed to be ???"" or maybe ???"" It's pretty terrible. It's only redeeming quality is the Game of Thrones subject matter. If this was Power Rangers or TMNT instead it would be buried.  My 9th grade art project was better than this.",Yup!,Yeah! I'm trying to convince the artist to make them for sale. It's so good!,"The woman hugging her is Yara. The creeper behind her is the High Sparrow. That's Yara's hand on her butt, though. I thought it was the creeper's.",Ser Pounce,Euron is hugging Jaime and the guy holding the card is Walder Frey.,"Haha Sansa is hugging Ramsay (that's one of his hounds), Brienne's hand is on Stannis. The girl on the right is Margaery and holding her is Yara. The guy creeping behind her is the High Sparrow. The guy holding the card/invitation is Walder Frey.","Seeing as I'm the one you're calling ""fucking delusional"" for saying this crosspost (not repost, btw) is ""awesome,"" I'll respond with **your** own quote: 

""And look what thoughts you are contributing to the thread and comments: negativity. I pity you sir. I hope someday that closed off little mind of yours decides to open up and be receptive and positive to different things in your life.

Why don't you try smiling today for a change and not being such a negative pain in everybody's ass? With your shitty negative agressive\[sic\] attitude nobody is going to listen or even care about the hateful words spewing from that hole in you\[sic\] face. Maybe if you tried not being an insufferable angry little twat people would give a shit what you to say,.\[sic\]""","It's just a parody, not meant to be perfect.",Ngl I completely forgot about him. I can’t remember what happened to him so I assume he’s dead now...,Ahh! Thank you.,aaaah thanks :),I love reaction videos but this was so... barely reactive compared to all the others! Haha,Yes.. your would think people would give a much better reaction to the death of their Queen. The last season really brought down the image of Dany.,Jorah would not have killed Dany because of his love and loyalty.  Die protecting her feels right.,"I could see it with some kind of subverted reason that would make Jorah revelate on his khaleesi's actions. I could also see it the other way. Imagine if sansa had sent arya to kill dany and Jorah tried to stop her. Arya slays Jorah then finally gets punished in the show and is killed by Drogon with dany. Jon is crushed and forced to kill dany after an already strained emotional position. Not sure if it all sounds straight, but thats how I'd do it","&#x200B;

>Jon’s SUPER DEAD. LIKE SUPER DEAD. (Honestly, he deserved it for spilling the beans. I’d like him to stay dead, but I can’t ignore that he was resurrected by the Lord of Light once before so...)  
>  
>Crows land around Jon’s body and pick at his corpse. He lays face up in the grass on the Isle of Faces. (Guess who one of the crows is)  
>  
>Bran comes out of his warg K-hole. He’s with Bronn and Tyrion on a boat. Both the dwarf and the sellsword are asleep. Bran fetches a scrap of paper and his pen and writes a message for Sansa. He ties the scroll to a raven’s talon and let’s it fly.  
>  
>Tyrion wakes up and looks at Bran. “What have you done?”  
>  
>“Daenerys killed Jon Snow. She is Azor Ahai.”  
>  
>Bran’s eyes roll back as he wargs into the raven carrying his message for Sansa.  
>  
>Tyrion wakes Bronn up. “Sail us south to Dragonstone.”  
>  
>Arya rides south with the Northern armies + the Wildlings led by Tormund + a sea of Unsullied, + Dothraki hoard, but splits off with the Hound and Ser Beric toward the God’s Eye Lake in the Riverlands to check in on Jon and Daenerys.  
>  
>As they ride, the Hound teases Arya for being pissed that Cersei got away and her list of names means nothing.  
>  
>Arya throws the Hound “don’t fuck with me eyes.”  
>  
>Daenerys lands on Dragonstone with both her dragons and no Jon Snow. Varys takes notice and swiftly departs to do spidery shit.  
>  
>Daenerys is furious when she hears that Messandei has been captured by the enemy. Greyworm is distraught with guilt.  
>  
>Tyrion lands on Dragonstone with Bronn and Bran. Tyrion asks Bronn to wheel Bran into the library and enjoy as much wine as he likes. Tyrion councils alone with Daenerys. She presents him Jon Snow’s sword, Longclaw, the one she used to kill him according to Tyrion’s plan. Tyrion watches the sword catch on fire in Dany’s hands and bends the knee. He confesses that Varys also knows the truth about Jon’s lineage and has been sending out ravens and telling his band of newsies to start spreading the word about Aegon Targaeryen to the heads of all the houses of Westeros.  
>  
>Daenerys holds her flaming sword over Tyrion’s head, rebuking him for betraying her trust and sharing the truth about Jon Snow with Varys. Not that it matters anymore. There is no more Jon Snow. No more Aegon Targaeryan. She made sure of that. Daenerys ultimately spares Tyrion, telling him that if he fails her again it will be for the LAST time.  
>  
>Daenerys still executes Varys by dragon fire for conspiring against her (Only she now kills him with 2 dragons).  
>  
>She asks Varys if he has any last words. Varys flips a coin to Tyrion. (Symbol-gasm).  
>  
>Watching Varys burn is hard for Tyrion. He looks at the coin in his hand. He looks up at Daenerys. “What about my sister?”  
>  
>After ambushing Daenerys’ fleet at Dragonstone, the Iron Fleet is sailing southwest over the bottom cape of Westeros toward the Iron Islands. On the boat, Euron is doing some twisted sex shit with Messindei. (I don’t like writing that). Cersei watches. She’ll throw anything at Euron to keep him off of her.  
>  
>The Mountain is guarding the door of Euron’s Captain’s quarters.  
>  
>When Euron is finished, he locks Missendei back in chains. He sits with Cersei and drinks wine that she pours from him. He romanticizes about the life they will enjoy together pirating at sea. He promises Cersei that she can still be a queen on the Iron Islands. The dead can’t swim, so they’ll be safe to “grow old, and fuck, and one day I’ll put a prince in your belly.”  
>  
>“There’s already a prince in my belly,” says Cersei.  
>  
>Euron laughs. Then we’ll rip it out and put another one in. You belong to me now.” He grabs Cersei by the face. “What power do you still think you have?”  
>  
>Cersei holds up an empty vile. Euron’s confused.  
>  
>“You Iron Born never were very bright.”

>Euron drops his wine cup. He realizes Cersei has poisoned him (with that vile Qyburn hooked her up with).  
>  
>“You bitch.”  
>  
>“This bitch belongs to no one.”  
>  
>Euron collapses, dead. (We wish it could have been more painful).  
>  
>Cersei stomps on his face. She takes out all her rage against the Night King on his corpse. (That’s better).  
>  
>Missendei is shook (fucking white people). Cersei calmly walks over to her and caresses her face.  
>  
>Missendei shakes and asks “What are you going to do?”  
>  
>Cersei smiles. “Whatever I want.”  
>  
>Cersei rises and opens a latch in the door. She whispers to a crew member. “Euron says turn the ship around. We’re sailing back East.”  
>  
>The Hound uses his new found flaming sword ability to roast a chicken. He shares the bird with Ser Beric (still healing from his many stab wounds, wondering why he decided to ride a horse for the last few days). Sandor saves a portion of chicken for Arya, but she’s off staring at the water.  
>  
>The Hound brings Arya a drumstick.  
>  
>“I know why you’re angry. You think you’ve lost something. But all you really lost was the time you spent listing fucking names.”  
>  
>“My list meant everything.” Arya’s so angry, she shaking. “No matter where I was in the world. I always knew where Cersei was. I could always see her face waiting for me in King’s Landing. Now I’m blind again. I don’t know where to go.”  
>  
>Sandor looks surprised. “You were blind?”  
>  
>Arya ignores him. “I’m not sure what there is to live for except revenge.”

>The Hound chucks his chicken bones off the cliff. “I know how you feel.”

>“Yeah, and you’ve got whatever cunt God changed you into no one.”  
>  
>“The Faceless God.”

>“Yeah. Sounds like a cunt.” (Somebody give this man all the fucking chickens).  
>  
>“If you killed the Mountain today, what would you do with the rest of your life?”  
>  
>The question stops the Hound. He turns around and shrugs, “Die slower. You’re still young. What will you do with your life after you kill Cersei?”  
>  
>“I’ve thought about sailing back to Esos one day. I could start a new life,” says Arya, “with a new face.”  
>  
>“Sounds like a good plan,” says the Hound, “There’s no dead ice fuckers in Esos.”  
>  
>Sansa reaches the west shore with the Northern refugees. Yara awaits their arrival on the beach with her ships, ready to ferry the survivors of Winterfell to safety. Gilly and baby Sam board the ships to sail to the Iron Islands.  
>  
>Bran’s Raven arrives for Sansa. Yara delivers the message. Sansa reads and learns that Jon has been killed by Daenerys.

>Sansa chooses not to leave on the ships with her people. She tells Yara she has work to do and rides south with a few guards.

(Somewhere Jim Ross shouts MY GOD HE JUST BROKE THAT MAN IN HALF!) The Mountain grabs Sandor’s sword and snaps it, then stabs Sandor with a shard in the shoulder.

There is no best ending.  


I think there were many flaws (REALLY BIG ONES) but at the end of the day, let's be happy with the show we got, and the 5 /6 good seasons.  


Now we will have a cultural reference for decades to come. Just today I saw this amazing infographic:  [https://valuer.ai/blog/what-corporate-innovation-has-in-common-with-game-of-thrones/](https://valuer.ai/blog/what-corporate-innovation-has-in-common-with-game-of-thrones/)   
I expect much more to come from GoT universe.",My 2 favorite episodes are the last 2 of Season 6 .  1st place - Episode 9 Battle of the Bastards.  Episode 10 The Winds of Winter  - Cersei blows up the Great Sept and with so much more in this episode.  I have re watched these 2 episodes a lot because they are awesome.,First I gotta say that I love the show and really wasn’t all that upset with how it ended. But I’ve been really curious about how much the show cost *in total*. Google has lead me to numbers for the pilot episode and some of the first season along with season 6 numbers. Anyone have a number?,Personally I’m glad the train wreck has come to an end. Time for better things and better show runners for HBO.,I'm happy the train finally completely derailed. That last season was some of the worst writing I've ever seen. At least we can meme about how terrible it was for weeks to come.,"To be honest, I like the last episode, but the second to last was a bit – let's say – underwhelming...","I mean I disagree that Game of Thrones is bad the last couple years if that’s what you’re saying. That being said I just hope when a show is deemed popular enough for an ending  that HBO makes sure the show runners have an ending... 

 I don’t want to give corporate creative control over to HBO or any network  but I think in this case there needs to be a little... it’s getting to where shows very rarely have good Endings. It’s usually because of shit like this.Poor planning and budgeting",I personally think we've just been spoiled by the previous seasons...,True but I mean if this show started with season 7/8 it would have been canceled after two seasons. That's how bad it got.,Makes sense on several levels.. And actually I think there was a part of the Ramin Djawadi soundtrack that get's into a percussive pattern that resembles the Muse's Uprising piece. Original Muse's video here..  [https://youtu.be/w8KQmps-Sog](https://youtu.be/w8KQmps-Sog) for funsies...,"Yes you’re right Jamie, it makes so sense.",This is by far the best analysis I've seen. What I wish was the actual ending.,Take this over to r/gottheories as well.,I really like this all! Except Arya assassinating Euron and helping Dany instead of her family and the North don’t make sense to me.,This is the ending the story deserves,This is great. Definitely make a YouTube video!,*claps*,10/10.,"This is brilliant. I re-imagined the final episode and posted my version of events over at r/gameofthrones but I'll copy and paste it here:

Jon walks through the wreckage of King's Landing on his way to the Red Keep as he did in the show, but this time Arya and Tyrion are by his side as well as Ser Davos and the Northmen.

They come upon Grey Worm and his men preparing to execute the Lannister soldiers. This time a more heated confrontation takes place leading to the death of the few unsullied present but not before one of them manages to cut off Tyrions right hand. Arya and Greyworm face off one on one. They climb the rubble sparing with both words and weapons. He, adamant that his queen did what was right in destroying the city and Ayra on the side of reason and compassion. She swipes at him with the Valerian dagger but it is knocked from her grip by his spear. It falls at the feet of Jon who is still below battling the remaining unsullied with the Northmen. She pulls needle from its sheath and squares off against Greyworm. When the dust has settled on this small skirmish only the Northmen, Ser Davos, a one-handed Tyrion and a few Lannister men remain. Arya and Greyworm are nowhere to be seen. Jon tells the Lannisters to flee the city. He and Tyrion then slump onto the ground amidst the rubble having the same conversation they had on the show, with Tyrion trying his best to convince Jon that Dany is a tyrant. Before they leave, Jon picks up the Valerian dagger, ponders what he might do with it, but returns it to the ground.

The group make their way to the Red Keep where they find Dany atop the giant stairs making a speech to her gathered army beneath an enormous Targaryen sigil flag, Greyworm by her side. She anoints him Master of War. They look on in horror.

Tyrion splits from the group to search for Jamie. Jon follows Dany to the throne room, passing Drogon and Greyworm on the way. Jon sees Arya's dagger on his belt and yells 'GREYWORM!' and grabs him by the throat as he approaches. Greyworm replies ""That's not me"" and hands Jon the Valerian dagger. This then plays out how it does on the show, Tyrion finding his siblings buried under rocks and Jon stabbing Dany through the heart as he kissed her. But this time it's the Valerian dagger that Jon uses. Tyrion lays down with this brother and sister, bleeding heavily from where his hand once was, we see him pass out. We return to the throne room. Jon lifts Danys limp body in his arms carrying her to the Iron Throne. He looks at it but does not sit. Drogon appears. He is furious and distraught, crying and whimpering through the roars. He stares down at Jon and Jon stares back. He whipsers to the dragon... ""dracarys"". Dany, Jon and the throne are engulfed in flames. We hear Jon yelling through the fire, DRACARYS!""

Unsullied, Dothraki and Ser Davos along with soldiers from the north all run to a vantage point where they can see Drogon and the throne room through the destroyed walls of the Red Keep. The dragon closes his mouth and the flames and smoke clear leaving nothing but the melted remains of the thrones as well as a naked but unharmed Aegon Targaryen holding the naked body of Daenerys Targaryen. He lays her down, Drogon approaches him and he touches his face gently. He then mounts the dragon and flys away.

Greyworm(Arya?) comand the unsullied and Dothraki to disband and return to their homes as their queen is dead and there is nothing for them here in Kings Landing.

We cut to several months later, Aegon/Jon is is sat upon a simple wooden throne ruling the 7 Kingdoms from Winterfell, the new capital side by side with Sansa, his one eared dire wolf, Ghost (who got lots of pats) and his new loyal dragon, Drogon. Ser Davos as hand of the king, Sam as Grand Maester and Bran doing creepy Bran things. Tormund returned to the new capital in search of the big woman who is of course now a kings guard at Winterfell.

Jon would ride Drogon a few more times to defend the Kingdom from invaders and Bran would on occasion warg into the dragon too... because of course he always could.

Tyrion did not die and is now lord of Kings Landing, rebuilding the city and sporting a very familiar golden hand.

The End.

What do you think?","I actually never understood why Arya was such a wasted potential character. She is fitting of a master of whispers or even a shadowy character that would act as a lurker instead of all this ridiculous and weird character development we had, she was no longer an assassin, just a mere bystander. I liked her until S8 :(",You should write about this too!,You broke your promise.,"Thank you, Arya assassinating Euron and helping Dany was indirectly helping the Northmen as well as they were all on the same team. That was the second and better plan they thought of in order for Drogon to make it in the walls unchallenged and in turn helping the Nothmen, unsullied, and dothraki enter the city unchallenged as well.  
It is meant to tackle two of my issues 1) Arya's faceless abilities being useless in the show and 2) Drogon being much too powerful and scorpions useless although they were so useful against Rheagal","To be honest I don't really know how, if we can get Alt Shift X to do it that would be great!",Beautiful,"I suppose if Jon died, why would Dany come to Winterfell to help with the Night King? It would be a completely different story. They would have never met. She might have still made it to Kings Landing but it wouldn't be the same. Arya wouldn't have gone back to Winterfell (she was on her way to Kings Landing until she heard he was back there.) She also didn't know Dany. None of it would have made sense otherwise. Just like Bran said... it all happened for a reason.

Edit to add: Jon dying wouldn't have mattered that he was a Targaryen. It wouldn't have added to the conflict of Dany's madness.","I'm guessing.. just to kill Dany? Maybe they we're trying to add as much character as possible before doing nothing with it to make Jon look tragic.. like ""oh poor John..came back from the dead, fell in love, found out he's aegon, killed love, rejected birthright""",Hmmm I like that. Makes sense,But don’t you think anyone could’ve killed Dany? I mean Arya could’ve used a face to a close advisor. I don’t feel like it had to be Jon,That is true. It really didn't have to be Jon. They just went with the easiest route and threw in backstory for him to make us feel bad for him in the end. Which is also not fair to Jon or Dany.,OMG I want whatever drugs Brian is on. They good!!!,"You are missing out on a perfect opportunity, you do realize that right? Brian of Tarth??!! Hello!!  :D","Yes, totally forgot :(( she was awesome in the episode! I also liked that Jaime, Tyrion and Cersei got a pretty good last moment 😭",Keep bringing it.. Good times.,I was thinking the exact same thing. It would have changed the show but not by much and for the better because the new show runners would hopefully still be taking notes from GRRM.,i would guess maybe something to do with contracts?,Having to share royalties maybe?,GRRM gave the exclusive rights to make the show to David and DB so HBO couldn’t hire anybody else to do it even if they wanted to which is why they’re moving forward with spinoffs so aggressively. GRRM didn’t want to make the book a show for years but David and DB came to him and convinced him they knew the books and that they would do it justice,Yeah I mean I’m still really really confused about this whole thing and think we as fans and viewers were extremely ripped off.,"Wouldn’t D&D be out of their contract with GoT and HBO after episode 73 was aired and finished? Like maybe their contract explicitly named them to be the ones to write the ending, but come on, I personally don’t believe that to be true at all. Do you?","Yeah but what if the new names of the new writers would only be on the seasons that they wrote, and the names of D&D would only be on the seasons that they wrote how would royalties be being shared?",i'm just guessing,"I know you are, that’s all anyone can do, sorry if it seemed like I was accusing you of something or anything","it's fine, i thought my comment could've been taken another way too lol",That's really interesting data...,Glad you found it interesting! I certainly enjoyed working with it,"oh wait, you aren't Brian, ignore my last comment. LOL!!","the data was really cool.. is it possible to do something that looks at who was the craziest of all the characters? It's subjective, I understand.. but maybe there is some handy-dandy AI routine that you can leverage.","Ahh ok, please don't take that as an insult. I love my drugs.",So you didn't like the data. Got it. LOL,"I thought about doing some ""sentiment analysis"", which there are some canned machine learning libraries for, but it's not my expertise so it would have taken a few hours, and I only had a couple hours to work on this yesterday!","No, I loved it.

Frankly I found it ridiculous","The biggest problem I have with it is and really the only reason it didn’t work was because they tried to force 2+ seasons of character development into 6 episodes. If they didn’t rush the finale then I think people would’ve been able to see the development from breaker of chains to mad queen (the evidence was there the whole time, people were just used to 6 seasons of her being a good queen that they couldn’t accept how she changed in a few episodes)","For me if she was going to burn the whole city she has to go to the Red Keep first.  When the bells ring she is starring at the one place that has the two things she wants, power(Iron Throne) and vengeance(Cersei). Then she ignores it to burn random people in random streets.","And maybe they didn't even need her to go ""mad queen"" in order for her to complete her story arc. She could have died another way that would have led to the same outcome. I've never been a huge fan of the character, although I've always loved Emilia Clarke's portrayal...","As a fan of her since the first season, I can understand how fans would be in denial about the trajectory of her arc but if you go back and watch you can clearly see the signs of her starting to change","There is no denial but at the same time her arch is shoehorned and quite silly. 

Her conversation with Jon in the throne room after the battle is quite weak. 

Her big speech is weak as well. 

Best to just act like the last season never happened honestly. Season 7 for that matter too.","I don't disagree, she's always been really vindicative and borderline megalomaniac. But never in her arc (that I can recall anyways) has she done something even close to telegraphing this kind of behavior, where she would target 1 million innocent people, many of them helpless.. All the the hardcore stuff she's done in the past has been against people who had it coming, IE the slavers, or people who were directly challenging her legitimacy. That's just my opinion though..","This. I can see her going to the Red Keep and destroying it, and some innocent people in it and nearby dying. They've made it that far with character development. But what we got skips a few critical steps in her progression.","Exactly, and that’s why we needed a few more seasons for this arc to properly play out.",True.. or they also could have done better setting it up in earlier seasons.. they had all of season 7 whats she was already in Westeros.,Yes and I think they did a good job of beginning to show us her change in temperament in season 7 so they should’ve brought her to Westeros sooner or added a couple of seasons,You think they could have crammed that amount of development into season 7? Or would that be a bridge too far maybe? Also in retrospect did she really need to get romantically involved with jon for the plot to work?,"It all comes back to the fact that the forced too much in too soon. I doubt they could’ve don’t proper character development for her in only season 7 which is why we were all so confessed about her in season 8. As far as the romance with Jon ,the only reason that was relevant was because Jon ended up being a Targaryen. And again with more time to properly explore the characters’ development this could’ve been much more interesting than it was. With the way it was rushed, they only significance of him being a Targaryen was to cause strife between him and Dany","She said to Jon “people here don’t love me. You either rule by or by fear. Fear it will be.”

Add that to what she suffered in her short time in Westeros - and the fact she was already a power-hungry prône to violence leader. (All her actions in Essos, burning the Tarlys, her stink eye whenever she was looking at Sansa...).

- losing viserion 
- Jorah dying
- her troops decimated in the battle of Winterfell
- Jon rejecting her
- Sansa treating her as an equal
- Jon having a better claim to the throne
- losing rhaegal 
- misandei dying in front of her
- Varys betrayal
= Tyrion betrayal

So...She decided that it was going to be fear.
She knew people surrendered, but it wasn’t enough for her.

All the signs were there.",There's an extension on Firefox that speeds up Netflix. Might work for HBO. It's called something like HTML5 speed.,I feel like they should’ve had a badass Fight scene between grey worm and Jon snow. Something like that,"I feel like the nights watch is pointless now, No white walkers, and the free folk has been ""befriended"" by the north lol. So why?  
I think it's just another ridiculisness of D&D that ""kinda forgot"" about something lol  
Though it would have been so much fcking better if the show ended with black screen and a horn giving the signal 3 times letting us know there is still danger, and there will always be","Bad writing. The scene where Jon was having goodbyes with Tyrion and then his siblings makes it obvious that Jon was going back to the Nights Watch proper, yet the nights Watch nolonger existed as all the watchmen are dead, nor does it need to exist as all the threats from over the wall nolonger exist. This is just one of many things that didn't make sense but probably one of the biggest. To not understand this is mindboggingly stupid.","hmm I think that the ending was very open ended. In the last scene, sam was about to say something about Dany going East to the place where the red priestesses are. So I think she might be revived and might be nissa nissa or the night queen. So since there was a lore about an old lord commander falling in love with the night queen, i think that's jon and dany's fate then they'll give birth to a night kid or something idk",But who closed the gate after they left on their way behind the wall?,"It’s lazy writing. They can say it was to “trick” the Unsullied, but Greyworm isn’t stupid, so he would never buy that. Jon was very clearly just going to be with the free folk, which is where he wanted to be anyways. They could’ve just said that and it wouldn’t have made any difference.","""We're the Nights watch now!""

https://youtu.be/FCaGQJzGjjk

1min 34sec mark.",That’s why I feel they pretty much tricked the unsullied and said he would be there. But Jon is really going to be where he wants to. The real north. I would’ve liked the ending better if Sansa pardoned him from nights watch and he said “I’m going north” or something like that,Sure there’s still nights watch people. There was still some in black. But maybe a few? But I don’t think there’s really a Nights Watch,"The nights watch guard the realms of men. From white walkers and wildlings.

Now that white walkers and night king are gone, there's no threat from them. And wildlings seem to follow Jon/Tormund now, so there's no threat from them either.

Jon should have willingly chosen to go north of the wall, just because he prefers wildling way of life.tab","Officially it still exsist as it still had surviving members after the battle and Sam was going to be a Maester according what was agreed (Maester for the Night's Watch). But honestly it is just the only way they could explain to Grey Worm why Jon can't get executed. I don't think Jon took the oath again. I simply think he went to castle Black, found his old cloak and left with the Wildlings the same day he arrived.","Technically the Dothraki report to Jon, too.",Then who shut the gates behind them ????????? Or does the gate work on a timer ?😅,I was kind of under the impression he went there and then left to integrate with the wildlings like a fugitive of some sort.,"I think that was lowkey the point. Bran used the Night's Watch as a convenient way to take Jon out of the picture and have him renounce all claim to being King in the North or King of the Six Kingdoms (as that would have kicked off more war) while also giving him an escape route from being executed. So everyone accepts this, Jon goes up North and he lives the rest of his life in exile with the freefolk - as Bran knew he would do.

His conversation with Tyrion is pretty telling. He starts surprised that the Night's Watch still exists and then tells Tyrion he expects never to see him again.... when Tyrion says he'll probably want to go up to the wall after a few years as hand he doesn't give any reaction. I think he already had the plan in his head to just immediately desert the Night's Watch and join Tormund and Ghost across the wall.","I mean that was pretty obvious when John showed up at Castle Black and there were only freefolk and he immediately left and headed North. John is not part of the Nights Watch because the Nights Watch no longer exists. 

Even if it did it would now be in the kingdom of the North and not under the jurisdiction of The Six Kingdoms.",Yup! Would’ve been badass,"I think it was mostly a ploy to “punish” Jon without doing anything at all. Sansa ensured that the North was independent, so Jon can essentially do what he wants.","I mean Greyworm and the Unsullied were at the Battle of Winterfell, they would have known that there were next to no men from the Nights Watch as part of the army against the dead. So for them to be oblivious that the Nights Watch was all but non-existend is a stretch.",I honestly though Jon would ride Drogon and then take control over the unsullied and Dothraki,"Yeah, i really miss the 1v1 fight scenes that were shown alot in earlier seasons. I also wish more was done with the golden company, i mean, they were soooo underused, appeared, did nothing & died. So stupid, i would have loved if Jon and Greyworm started fighting when Dany gave the speech, and everyone would see it down below and start fighting too, the northmen vs unsullied.","Stretching it too much could've been bland. Well,  especially with how the past 2 seasons have been...

But it could've been an epic battle, with Drogon either helping the unsullied, maybe raging and attacking everyone or helping Jon out as the last Targaryen.","They did leave the door wide open though, and it's possible the ending was not entirely pointless.

Jon was conveniently placed back in the North by Bran for seemingly no reason other than to make amends with the unsullied.  But perhaps Bran sees a greater plan for Jon.  Now the Three-Eyed Raven, who had strong ties to the Children of the Forest, is it possible Bran sent Jon back to the North knowing that he will someday be turned into the next Night's King?  Of course this would only be possible if some of the CotF still remain, but it would make sense that the CotF would want to re-introduce another Night's King to restore balance and prevent man from consuming what remains of their world.

Jon's story is already very close to that of the original Night's King, being the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and having fallen in love with a queen who's skin was (coincidentally) ""as white as the moon"".  Jon, a warrior ""who knows no fear"", closely matches the description of the original Nights King before the Night King was turned.

I think it would make sense that the CotF would devise a plan utilizing perhaps their greatest advantage over men, time.  The CotF live to be hundreds of years old, while any man would be lucky to see a full century - let alone half a century given the average lifespan of the show's characters.  Since the CotF live such long lives, perhaps whatever plan they originally put forth when they created the Night King was not expected to finish manifesting for hundreds, or even thousands of years.

It's also not clear whether or not Bran (the Three-Eyed Raven) is actually capable of seeing the future.  In the show Bran experienced many past events, but we never witnessed any future events.  Perhaps this is because Bran actually can't see the future, but instead knows the cyclical past.  And because (if) the timeline is truly cyclical, then it follows that Bran's ability to see the past also enables him to predict the future.  This would also give Bran an interest in preserving the cyclical timeline by aiding in the creation of the next Night King.

It would be interesting if amongst all the scheming of men, there was a greater scheme set forth by the CotF to preserve what's left of the pre-Westeros world - before the First Men arrived and pillaged their world.

The theme of cyclicality also seems to be somewhat prominent in the show; the best example being the emphasis on seasons (Winter is coming!).  Much of the history seems to be associated with the seasons, and seasons as we know come and go in cycles.

It's all unlikely this is the intended direction of the writers/author, but it would make for an interesting 'sprequel', continuing where the story left off while also exploring the origins of the Night's King.","Maybe we are suppose to assume that the watchmen respawned, like the dothraki and unsullied in patch 8.5","Not all the watchmen are dead.  Those at the shadow tower missed the battle of winterfell, they're still alive. Jon wasn't formally admitted into the night's watch a second time, so now he's just a fugitive from justice like Ser Jorah.","I think not. HBO has been clear there will be no sequels. These characters and this generation is over. 

The spin offs are to be set in new eras entirely.",The gate doesnt matter either.. there is a HUGE HOLE IN THE WALL.,Why do you say that’s where Jon wanted to be. And that’s where he was happiest,That’s the way I see it too!,Obviously there was survivors of nights watch but I mean there’s no point of it. They obviously may try and rebuild it but I believe Jon is free and not apart of it. Instead living with wildlings,See that’s what I don’t get. I’m sure the unsullied know as well there’s no nights watch. Grey worm isn’t dumb. That’s why it makes no sense they just let him walk,Lady B vs the hound is an all time great. Wtf happened to my favorite show man,"As much as I appreciate the effort of this comment it’s just shitty phoned in writing. There was no greater plan or open doors to come back too. The show runners do not care. 

We have the hope of future books with proper writing, plot, and adventures to look forward too.","Except appeared to be Lord Commander... Again. Let's face it, Jon was *rewarded* his 'punishment'. He's back in the North in close proximity to his family, he's pretty much seen as a king/God by the Wildlings and there's no threats north of a now pointless wall.","The hole wasn't in Castle Black though, it was in Eastwatch.","Because he fit in with them. He felt like such an outcast his entire life and with them he felt free. I am semi basing it on my opinions after reading the books, but I truly think that with Dany gone, he wanted to be away from everything else, He loves the Starks, but at the same time, he needs more freedom than the walls of Winterfell could’ve provided.","Jon literally tells Tormund he wishes he could come with him and the Free Folk beyond the Wall in 8.4, and it's obvious he means it. He has the Real North in him! It is where he was the happiest - a simpler life, free from politics, intrigue and whispers, and after the trauma of murdering the woman he loved, you bet he needs to leave Westeros behind.",The tiny plant you see just after the Free folk went out of the gate is also a sign for me at least. The Wall will melt. The Night's Watch means nothing without White Walkers and without their wall,I think the nights watch could just be used as another place for criminals to go...,If that’s how Jon’s story ends in the books though it could be GRRM’s intention.,He should have stayed in that cave with Ygritte :(,"Yeah, if you read Jon Snow on wiki page it actually says he was lord commander at the end  but the Nights Watch obviously knows him and what he’s been through so they just let him go and live beyond the wall at the end.

Everyone was intended where they were supposed to be. Idk why everyone is so mad about it.

On reflection he is probably the worst person for the job.",Little finger  made lot of money from brothels.,Make Westeros Great Again!,See that’s the thing that pissed me off more than anything. I was expecting Sansa or Samwell to give a badass speech about Jon Snow about why he should be king. I know he don’t want it. But neither did Bran. Snow was literally the Power horse this whole series and then he just gets sent to the wall. And the whole Aegon Targaryen thing seems so pointless in this whole series. Like what was the point of that? I guess the only thing you can say is it somewhat caused dany to go mad,"It was a calculated move to appease Greyworm but it also served to tie up some loose ends in the story.   It served to get Jon, the true heir to the throne, out of the ""6 Kingdoms"" and Winterfell.    It served to officially have him renounce any claim to the throne.

&#x200B;

Certainly, Jon did not want to be king.  He kept saying it.    Honestly, maybe he would enjoy life with Tormund more than being in Kings Landing or Winterfell.

&#x200B;

But, it was so ridiculous how it all happened.  Greyworm takes Jon prisoner (he doesn't execute him on sight - which he had no problem doing to some random Lannister soldiers that surrendered) and then lets a council of nobles decide on a new king and Jon's ""punishment"".    

Greyworm then leaves, but the new King and Queen decide... ""well, sorry there is nothing we can do... ""  You mean, they couldn't pardon him?  Kings pardon people all of the time.  Treaties between countries are broken...all the time... yet, they had to honor their pact with Greyworm - who was a war criminal in Westeros, wasn't the leader of a noble house and wouldn't be returning to Westeros any time soon.  Why? 

&#x200B;

All of the people, who for so many episodes this season had been plotting to put Jon on the throne, just kind of ignored Jon as the choice for the new king.  Tyrion literally talked Jon into killing Dany and then decides, hmm... Bran has a more interesting story, so choose him.

&#x200B;

If Jon had stayed in Winterfell, there is no way Sansa is crowned Queen in the North.  Jon had the love and loyalty of the people.  He fought and lead them in the battle against the dead and when they went south to honor their pledge to fight for Dany.   How convenient for Sansa, isn't it?

&#x200B;

Obviously, no one would have picked Bran as the King (not even the majority of fans who liked the character - myself included).   So, with Jon out of the way, choosing Bran was somehow a better resolution than what... Edmure?  Yara?  LOL.","This was obviously a calculated move by the Starks and Tyrion.  They knew full well that the Nights Watch was no longer there.  They needed a way to save face with the Unsullied before they left.  This is exactly why Tormund and the other Freefolk were waiting in Castle Black when Jon arrived (it had been several weeks since they had left for the true north).  They were sending Jon to go live free in the only place he has ever been truly happy.  There, he will live his life among the people who have accepted him as a leader, to live as the King beyond the wall.  Who knows, maybe in future spinoffs there will be a legend about him.  Maybe he will take his true name and the Targaryen name will live on beyond the wall.",Yeah I actually liked it but it seems like Jon went through too much to just be sent to the wall. Like he’s always been treated like a bastard. But if it was a trick to send him to the nights watch cause there’s really no such thing. And he truly wants to be in the real north. Then that makes me happy,The way im looking at this season is a brief visually representation of the ending to the books. GRRM pretty much admitted the same ending with way more development in his blog. Hopefully this season becomes watchable with the books filling in the gaps. Interested to hear opinions.,KING OF THE TRUE NORTH,"He probably dies in the books, possibly protecting Bran from the Night King. Show runners decided against it and therefore created the whole ark of Jon doing nothing apart from staying alive. Dany can be murdered by some other Stark or even Jaime.","Like what was the point of Varys, Sansa and Tyrion making a big deal about Jon being the true heir of the iron throne if they didn’t even mention it. My guess is that they knew grey work would never allow it. And plus they wanted to break the wheel and do it a different way","Grey worm was not himself in that episode. Had he been loyal he would have killed Jon, which was the expected reaction. Instead he imprisoned him. I had expected that Jon would end up with Tormund and Ghost but that he would abdicate the Iron throne. It would have been nice had it been his decision and not that of the silly council meeting of left over leaders.","He didn't go to the Wall because he was afraid of the Unsullied. He went to the wall because he blames himself for Daenerys's Death after all that jon didn't want to stay in kings landing or westeros. 
So i don't think he'll return just because Unsullied are gone....",Couldn’t agree more,"He tells Tyrion that he won’t see him again but Tyrion says he would visit him at the Wall but since Jon now goes with the free folk, will he visit his old friends and family again namely Sansa, Bran, Tyrion and Sam in the future years or is he still banished out of all the kingdoms so he can’t and they would have to come to visit him? 

Now I know he is with Tormund and all and he should be happy but I find the idea of him living in the freezing north with a 100 wildlings with nothing much to do kinda depressing. Based on how he asked Arya and his underwhelming response to Tyrion it seemed like he wanted to stay with his family.",I think that Jon is glad this show is over and can move on to better things haha.,"Instead the directors waste 3 minutes of screen time on another dreadful Edmund Tully speech... Sorry, I just, can't....","I agree. Sansa has been known to speak her mind about nearly anything regarding her fam so again there is a reason for her silence, or a poor job of writing,,,,and Sam? The writers ignored his dedication to Jon like in the past 7 seasons? What’s up with that. Anyway the destruction of the Iron Throne by dragon fire was symbolic in many ways, since the last dragon flies off as does Jon symbolically flying away to the real North,  as does Arya who goes away on her journey too.  And Bran cannot really sit on the throne as it used to exist. Since it’s destroyed. Possibly a good metaphor for his reign as temporary. Therefore my guess is at some point Jon Snow will return when he decides to rule in another sequel, or when he stops being so stupid about women which Sansa had every right to tell him, I warned your sorry ass about Dany,,,,,anyway Sequel and next series to come?","Bran didn't want it until ""Why do you think I came all this way?""

What a shite piece of writing.","In the real westeros, in the books, everyone is scheming all the time. Even Jon Snow. So you can't tell me that the smartest (politically  and otherwise) people in Westeros with apparently months to plan couldn't figure out a way to trick/force the Unsullied into leaving and Jon being king. But they instead have to honor some pact that Grey Worm will never be able to know if they honor. Seriously the Unsullied are at such a disadvantage intellectually. I don't think they can even read or write. They don't know the culture or customs. They don't use ravens. All 7 Kingdoms would not care about them. Honestly how are they even sailing ships? The ships would have to be lended to them by people who could operate them. So the sailors could just drop them off and be like good luck with the conquesting/retirement or whatever you're doing. There's no way the Unsullied would ever be able to come back even if they wanted to. It's a joke to all the characters, especially Sansa and the other Starks, to show up to this council without a plan",Jon snow as king would have provoked more wars. Bran was a better choice for peace. The problem I have is they did not build Bran’s character at all and most viewers did not have any emotional attachment to him.,">(he doesn't execute him on sight - which he had no problem doing to some random Lannister soldiers that surrendered)

The reason is because Dany gave a specific order to kill all the Lannisters. But she didn't give an order to kill Jon or Tyrion. Without an order, Grey Worm didn't know what to do.",It boggles my mind how Bran also has jurisdiction over the NW when the Kingdom in the North exists. Can anyone explain? Thanks!,I loved how you explained it. It makes the end sound more satisfying cause he’s being where he’s happy,"I had always hoped for a more dramatic ending, where Jon and Dany would take their own lives and leave this mortal coil, to rule the north as Night Queen and King.. But alas, it was not to be...","I’d like to imagine Jhonno living happy and have a family. And those children, noticing the great injustices done to him, come down from to north to end all the great houses of Westeros.","If sending Jon to the Night's watch was all a ruse to fool the unsullied, why include the scene where Tyrion is explaining Jon's fate to him? There is no reason for Tyrion to keep up the charade, since it's just the two of them in Jon's cell. There is no ""wink wink"" tone to the scene.","If he had stayed he would have always been known as “Queen Slayer”, just as Jaime was never able to shake that title.  The Night’s Watch is like a symbolic rebirth, where all past crimes are forgiven.  Staying would have reminding him, every day, that he killed the woman he loved, no matter where he went or what he accomplished.  He was happy north of the wall.  All he’d ever wanted was the freedom of a ranger, to go beyond the wall.  Now, after everything he’s been through, he finally gets to do what makes him happy.","I agree, and that would play into the whole ""Lord of light brought him back for a purpose and that purpose has been served"" foreshadowing.",The fact that Greyworm was influencing their decisions was so stupid to me. How are you going to let Tyrion in shackles help make decisions and not the heir to the throne? They were both prisoners.,"Grey Worm is getting a lot of shit, but think about it for a minute; the Unsullied are trained to be the perfect killing machines.  For god sakes, they have to murder a baby during their training!  Death and killing isn’t exactly something they’re uncomfortable with.

Aside from the cruel masters, Dani, was the only example of compassion they’d ever witnessed.  They didn’t know she’d gone insane, they just assumed that was how it was. He’d found his humanity with Missandei, but when she died he cast that aside so he wouldn’t be hurt again.  Taking John prisoner was done because he was uncertain where to take his orders from now, and he was unable to decide for himself.  

Yeah, what he did was fucked up, but also it wasn’t the Unsullied that were slaughtering women and children, that was the Dothraki and the north men.  The Unsullied slaughtered the soldiers, despite their surrender, because that’s what he’s seen his queen doing.","In defense of Edmure, literally everyone at that meeting should ua e been throwing their hats in the ring. In a world where there have been 3 wars of succession in like 12 years, the fact that when the throne is up for a vote no one besides Edmure thinks to put themselves forward as an option is ludicrous.",It was suppose to b comic,"It doesn't make any sense! Maybe it would if we heard any conversations Bran had the last two seasons - but without that, this really feels like it came out of left field. He was so intent on making sure Jon knew the truth about his parentage - what was the purpose? He was the only one (since Howland Reed never showed up) who knew - he could have kept it to himself?","Tyrion as hand would be more likely to provoke wars than Jon Snow as King. Jon would have the north, the Vale, riverlands, dorne, and the reach backing him. Maybe the iron isles are upset but they are pretty much powerless at this point so they'll do whatever they're told. 

Meanwhile pretty much everyone hates the lannisters, especially one that supposedly killed his King Nephew, killed his Lord father, and then escaped Justice.","Right, and killing random Lannister grunts is far, far different from killing Jon Snow without permission.",Everyone kind of forgot that,"I think everyone ended up where they want to be. Bran as the Three Eyed Raven is king, where he can pass judgement based on what has actually happened or what needs to happen. Tyrion is, in all respects, the one who is actually running the kingdom, as all Hands truly do.  Sam has become a Maester as he always intended.  Sansa has freed the North and has become a Queen, as she has wanted to from the start.  Arya is exploring and is not tied down to any one location, the life of a wanderer.  Jon is in the true North, the only place he has truly been happy.  

It may not have been the ending people wanted, but it is a fitting ending for such a great show.  It doesnt matter how it ended, people will have been upset, it is the only outcome when a show of this magnitude comes to a conclusion.","In the span of about 7-8 years, 3 kings, 2 queens, and 3 hands had died.

I can see why someone might be reticent to take the position.","The only Lords of the Great Houses left were the Starks, Edmure, Tyrion (House Lannister), Robyn Arryn, Gendry Baratheon and the New prince of Dorne. All the others were lords bannermen to the great houses.  Nobody would take a Lannister, Gendry and Robyn Arryn are obviously not ready. That just leaves the Prince of Dorne, Edmure and the Starks as candidates. Maybe House Greyjoy if they qualify, but they have almost as much baggage as the Lannisters. I still don't see why nobody pushed Jon Snow's claim. I guess the point is that Jon doesn't play the Game of Thrones, if he had, he would have let Dany execute Tyrion, then consolidated his power and waited for the moment where he could kill Dany and crush the unsullied either because they were dispersed or he had enough forces around him.","But Grey Worm and the Unsullied (one of the most powerful military forces currently in Westeros, esp. since they keep respawning), and the Dothraki, might have gone crazy with Snow as king and started taking everyone apart. This way, they accept the punishment of their beloved queen’s killer and leave Westeros.","My issue isn't how it ended. The actual ending is probably the best way to end it, but the way they got to the ending was so rushed and empty that it betrays the rest of the show.","I mean they could've just had Bran pardon him when they left.

Sansa's cousin (Rob Arryn?) from the Vale, the new prince of Dorne, and Edmure Tully",Thank you!,Sexiest theory I heard for a while.,They'll probably name him the new king beyond the wall.,He marches into the woods beyond the wall and finds the rest of the dead with Dany. The new Night King/Queen is born.,"I’m wondering the same thing! I thought he was LC when he was looking out over the men but seeing him ride north, I’m thinking he might have gotten a ‘pass’ from the NW and was allowed to join the free folk instead","I don't get why the wildlings want to go north of the wall, I thought they were only there because the wall trapped them there and people didn't like them?

Why would they want to return to extremely harsh living conditions when they could just start a new life south of the wall? 

Or is it just as simple as 'they didn't like the south in the end'?","I thought he would rejoin the NW (not so sure if he would be Lord Commander because he literally just join), but seeing the gates close I'm almost sure that he just joined the Free Folk and will live the rest of his days with them.

I doubt he'll become King Beyond the Wall, because that's exactly what he's trying to get away for, and honestly I don't think he'll go back to Winterfell, and certainly not to Kings Landing.",Do you feel if he wishes to visit Sansa or even Bran he could? In my happy imagination that’s possible. I mean the unsullied are away and uncle Benjen was able to visit Winterfell.,Also as he was looking over it was mainly free folk. There shouldn’t be much nights watchmen left. There is no point if it anyways. So in my mind I’m hoping that Jon is really free and choosing to be with the free folk. And is still able to visit Sansa and bran. And Arya if she comes home.,"I think they hated the South so much (and according to Tormmund even Winterfell is South) that they decided to go back home.

I'm not sure if they were trapped, I think most of them liked not having to live by the rules of the 7 Kingdoms.","Probably, I doubt he'd ever return south of the wall though. The real north is where he wants to be.",I know the Starks aren’t his real siblings but he loves them so much. Imagine if Sansa got married. I’m sure he would want to be there. And if Arya ever returned he would love to visit. Idk just my imagination. But if that’s where Jon truly wants to be I’m satisfied with how that ended.,"I think all are possible and definitely where he would rather be. His family still loves him. His beef was with Grey Worm and killing the ""queen""...","There was no explanation, but given how stupid Jon has proven himself to be I think it's a safe bet he turned himself in.

The real question is why didn't Grey Worm kill him? Why would he wait for the leaders of Westeros to arrive and hand judgement over to them? He had control over a superior fighting force - there was no reason for him to suddenly go all soft.","This issue is my biggest problem with S8 - all the heavy stuff is occurring off screen. I’m far from the first to say it, but so many critical reactions were left as “fade to black.” It’s like the writers shoved in all of GRRM’s bullet points but then decided not to spend the actual 20 episodes it would take to flesh them out they way the previous seasons did.",Honor compelled him to kill and to tell,There was also a substantial puddle of blood on the floor.,The grey-wormhole is what threw me. Jon sees Grey Worm executing soldiers in the street. Jon leaves him to go speak with Dany.  Grey Worm is there with Dany as Jon arrives. Therefore Grey Worm traveled thru space and time via a grey-wormhole to be in two places at once.  The writers must think GOT fans are dumb or they just didn’t care.,"I had the same question and my SO said the same - he can't help but confess/be truthful to a fault.

Kind of like how he volunteered that he shot Mance with an arrow but left out the part that he did so to end his suffering.","Stupid or honorable? 
It’s the same when people say he’s stupid for actually going to the Nights Watch when he could have stayed after the Unsullied left.

He has Ned Stark’s blood in his veins....",Spark notes GOT,"What would that have looked like? He waltzes out of the throne room to Grey Worm and just says ""I killed Dany but you won't find her body because the dragon flew away with it.""

The writers really shouldn't have went abruptly from the assassination to weeks later.",Being honourable in that situation is stupid.,">The writers really shouldn't have went abruptly from the assassination to weeks later.

Actually it was very important that they free up time so we could see Tyrion shift chairs around.","And Grey Worm's all like ""Ok, thanks for telling me. We'll lock you up instead of throwing your to her Dothraki.""","Rearranging the deck chairs, as it were.",So dumb. Worst bit of the episode for me.,"What a stupid fucking line. 
This script feels like it’s a soap opera held together with single sheets of toilet paper and spit",I can answer that.... for money!,"I wish I could offer some sort of compensation, but the study is funded by none other than my measly grad student stipend...","I honestly can't tell if Drogon is just a very understanding being that is incredibly rational and understands everything that happened and sees the game of thrones and the effects of power for what they are, and so burned down the chair to show how retarded the whole thing was, or if he's dumb as a rock and saw a pointy needle in Dany's heart and pointy sticks on the chair so thought the chair killed her and burned it down.

But either way that was the strongest moment of the episode for me.","I didn’t get weepy when Jon stabbed her, but started to as soon as Drogon started rolling her body around. I hate it when CGI makes me cry.","According to G.R.R.M, Dragons in this world are as intelligent as humans. While he did follow instructions from his bonded human, he was heartsick over all the things that happened and knew the reason.   
Rational lizards for the win.","Did Drogon feel any bond towards Jon? Since he was a Targaryen, plus Dany's lover.","No, Dragons only bond with one person.  Drogon believed ( the writers of the show) that the Throne and the war for it killed her and his brothers.","I have a theory

Bran made Dany go mad, just like previous Third Eyed Raven made The Targaryan King mad
( I dont buy ""accident"" part)

By making Dany mad, he knew John would have to kill her, and that is why he came to the meeting to select a new King","Wait, why is she too good for him. Tormund is good peeps.",Sure he's good peeps. They're just in different leagues. Just because he ogles her with dreamy eyes doesn't mean she should go for him. I was never for either team Brormund or Braime. I loved Gendry and Arya (Gendrya!) but these badass women don't need a man.,True that.. although Gendrya I am happy didn't become a thing...,"signing the rewrite petition is totally pointless. honestly, the season wasn't even that bad and it's gonna be a logistical nightmare for the production crew. all the actors have their own schedules, all the workers need to be paid, all the locations need to be booked, etc....

i understand people are frustrated with the season, but what's done is done. what else do people expect the producers to do after it's all over?","You’re right, it probably won’t happen (though I kinda disagree about the quality of the season obviously lol) For me at least, the point of signing the petition isn’t about actually getting it redone but to show that the quality of what was done wasn’t acceptable. If HBO gets enough backlash from this then they’ll know to make sure future shows are written for quality. Plus, if the backlash is REALLY bad HBO has probably made more than enough money off this season alone to redo it, if they really felt like they needed too to keep subscribers.","I definitely think the music, the locations and cinematography, and the actors are what really made this show outstanding. Plus, I love watching all the behind the scenes after each episode. The people who put that world together are amazing.","Rome has a similar level of cinematography, but not the same level of CGI.. Rome was HBO's practice run for GOT.",Thank you. Will definitely check that out.,You'll recognize some of the cast.,Wow this is the best season 8 meme I've seen and it's not even from r/freefolk. I'm impressed,"Chaos is a ramp. 
For Bran’s wheelchair.","The ending, It did needle me a bit. 😬",Clever... very punny,But George r.r. Martin told them the ending.,And make them die of that foolishness...,Lameeeeeee,Haha yeah,Took me too long to get that lol,Love the play on words/ reference,"Best season 8 meme indeed. 

Did you guys see someone even made an app about how they ruined the show? It's called ""game of throwing in the towel""","Worst ending ever, totally ruined the whole show","There was a better one in freefolk that said ""stick em with the disappointy end"".","Yeah but he didn’t make them rush it, I haven’t had any problems with what happened just it needed 2 more seasons to fee earned, seasons 5.5-8 have get like book spoilers or a highlight reel to me.",He said it's going to be different,Why is this a bad ending? Please explain...,It’s was GRRM’s ending though.,"Exactly.
It felt more like I heard/saw someone retell the plot of a story instead of watching the show.
It needed more seasons or less plot.","Because a lot of things doesn’t making any sense..
The show’s build up doesn’t match to the ending.
While John is the legal king, (and just saved their asses from the mad queen) everyone including his sisters and brother sending him for life prison instead of being loyal to their character & the story itself and save him in any cost. 
suddenly everyone is trying to do the right thing even if it’s says to send the real king to hell..
I can keep going but it’s too long","If that really was his ending, then he lied about it being bittersweet. Most of the surviving cast got rather happy endings.",Not true actually.,And to appease to Grey Worm! Really. When did that guy get a say on anything?!,When he held the city of King's Landing Hostage with the Unsullied and the Dothraki as the warlord of them all?,"Yeah a lot of questions coming up, I mean John couldn’t lie about Daenerys’s death? 
no one was watching..","He is a soldier though, easily maneuvered by the lords of Westeros/that Council. It’s hard to accept that the true heir to the throne, who killed an “usurper Queen”, would not take the throne because of Grey Worm. He is just not that important.",Fuckin' garlic bread... lol,"I know... 

best Gabagool I ever had",Thank you Drew for you long years of dedication. I love the story.,"A lot of people are saying that on the surface they got it right... the analogy I heard someone use is that they set out to build a custom car. All the sub systems were beautifully crafted but when they went to assemble the dang thing, nothing fit... I'm sure there are better analogies but that one rang true for me...","That makes sense. To me, I think they honestly couldn’t think of plot fillers to not rush the story. So instead of coming up with random stuff that wouldn’t stay true to Martin’s story, they just told us the gist of how it ended: almost how Martin would have if he told them. The last season is more a simplified version than a rushed story, imo. Or maybe that’s the same thing.","I am ok with simplified, that works for me. I enjoyed the last season quite a bit.. what was missing for me though were the tie-ins. The motivational stuff. I am not saying the Weiss and Benioff needed to spoon feed me, but even with Bran becoming the King for example. For me that was just a bridge too far, the guy was basically awol for 3 whole seasons. I would have rather it ended with the King's Moot or whatever that was, realizing they needed to find a king/or queen, without knowing who it was gonna be. And also, Sansa saying, well, ""the north will remain free"", if I'm Yara, or the ""new Dornish prince"" imma be like, ""...well then my people are gonna go ahead and remain free too.."" If someone has a good justification for why the people of Westeros would accept this outcome I would love to hear it. I mean hell, even in the North they have a hard time maintaining allegiance to a single ruler..","Such empty.. I'll start . My favorite scene of the entire series takes place in season 1. King Robert and Ned have gone hunting.  Except they're not hunting,  they're sitting together talking in this beautifully pastoral setting. A luscious display of fruits and other delicacies arranged before them like something out of a renaissance master's painting. Their guards are stationed along the ridgeline above them,  banners smartly dancing in the breeze, sunlit clouds prancing by. When I first saw this scene I found it stunning visually,  but on a deeper level it was also moving. There was no footage of the actual hunt. The hunt was simply a way for them to disappear from their duties and their pressures for a day so they could be friends and talk...",Rosebud.,And I bet A LOT of weirwood trees are going to be planted.  Everywhere.,I agree with you but she’s a product of her upbringing which was spoiled with Cat and Ned and then she had Cersei and Littlefinger as adult leader examples so... her turning out that way really is to be expected.,"Yea, I get that, but that doesn't mean everyone just pretends like she isn't at least partially responsible for what happened as well as power hungry. Bran didn't have to allow her request, and Jon could have given her some sort of scolding.",What’s with the pic of Tyrion...?,"It was wrapped up unrespectful ending, and I don't want to ruin the show for you but the ending destroyed this show and turned it to a mediocre fan favor kinda show. I give the last episode 3/10 and the show in general 6.5/10 rating.","Change my mind. As someone who has been a fan since the second book the clash of Kings, the ending was perfect. If you disagree, you’re a fake ass fan.","-	Dany's dragon wings. No purpose, but great visual.
-	The small council's banter over how money should be spent. Sewers or ships or brothels? Reminded me of some of the show's early seasons. 
-	Westeros nobility laughing hard at the idea of genuine democracy. Poor Sam...
-	 Tyrion survives.","Jon getting overwhelmed in the scene with Tyrion when Tyrion was a prisoner was great too, and Pod being a knight! Sansas appearance and what you pointed out, that she will probably stay single and not marry reminds me a lot of the Virgin Queen Elizabeth the first","* The scene that made me tear up more than most was the council meeting and panning out from that. It kind of reminded me of the scene in episode 2 by the fire before the battle.
* I also was glad they showed Tyrion going through the rubble (confirming the twins died) and giving him closure on that. I loved Tyrion's character throughout the series and I'm sooo glad he survived.
* Edmure's awkward moment
* I really loved Brienne writing in Jaime's story in the book. Regardless of how they ended, she still wanted to honor his journey. He knighted her and she is a woman of honor.

I don't think it ended how I would have liked, specifically, but the ending was beautiful for how it was going. I felt relief. Maybe because I've been junking out on it so hard and having some closure felt good. I'm looking forward to the documentary next week.

Edit to add: Arya going to where the maps end.","Dany being carried off by Drogon was iconic, though I wish the last two episodes were merged into one feature length episode so that moment came nearer the end rather than in the middle","When Sam said his speech about democracy, for a second I believed. Then, everyone laughed and I knew it was too soon. I agree, it was def a good moment.",I had the same thought regarding Elizabeth the first! Haha,"This has been such a horrible rushed ending to a wonderful show.  This season - especially the last three episodes - have been disappointing.

Jon is the heir. Nobody brought it up?  NOBODY? Tyrion?  Sansa? WTF?

Like too many shows, the final episode was just a complete disappointment."," what a fucking waste storywise  
 

if the coffee cup left in a scene that isnt seen for over a YEAR in  production didnt do it then the line in the show where Bran is made  ""king"" should  
 

Brandon is actually the SECOND Brandon - not the FIRST - the FIRST  Brandon was Brandon the Builder who built the wall and built Winterfell  from the Age of Heroes and was one of the First Men he was a King   
 

....this is Bran Stark not Brandon-  his name has ALWAYS been Bran and the line should be Bran Stark the FIRST of his name  
 

this shows you the contempt and lack of attention the writers have -  they cant even be bothered to remember the shit they did a few seasons  ago so why should i be surprised they dont even remember the lore that  was the background for this show  
 

visually the show is fantastic - if they put half as much effort in the  story as they did to the set pieces and SPX ( which they apparently  couldnt afford anyway )   
 

this shows ending would have been palatable  
 

but this ending had MORE of the same ridiculous character logic/action that all the previous eps had  
 

why would Drogon not kill Jon for murdering Dany? her body is gone -  what proof is there that Jon even commited regicide ? how is Grey Worm  or the other Unsullied or the Dothraki  not immediately kill Jon when he  tells them he killed her? how the FUCK is he walking along a dock  filled with Dothraki and Unsullied and they NOT kill him?

&#x200B;

 how do they ask  well who should be King and after FIVE FUCKING SHOWS of ""Jon youd be  the best Ruler "" from fucking Arya to Sansa to Samwell to even fucking  Tyrion - they all know that JOn is the rightful King hes the heir   
 

HOW in fuck  do they then ask - ""well who should be king?""   
 

HOW ABOUT THE GUY WHO IS FUCKING AEGON TARGARYN ?????????the ""rightful  Heir???HELLO ? even if Dany was killed by him he didnt take anything  that wasnt HIS already since he is the actual KING- theyve been fucking  each other over on this point for 6 episodes  
 

why is there a Knights Watch ? theres no more White Walkers which is the  reason FOR a Knights watch in the First place is correct makes no sense that bran would say or even declare there should be a Knights Watch. Why would being a guy  who isnt concerned with anything in the material world a good thing for  him being King? why since Sansa declared the North Free did Yara not get  to declare the Iron Islands ""free""?- they want to not be a part of the  Kingdom more than even the North its the whole reason Theon is at  Winterfell because the Iron Islands were conquered by the Kingdom at the  beginning of this story Theon is a ""hostage"" so that Balon wouldnt ""attack"" or rebel 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

.......THIS FUCKING SHOW  MAKES NO SENSE","Drogon: *sees a sword in Dany’s chest has killed her* 

*sees a chair literally made of swords*

“I FUCKING HATE SWOOOOOORRDDDSSS”

*burns Iron Throne*","You'd think with all the letters Varys sent, everyone would nominate Jon over Bran...but maybe no one's checked the mail in however long it's been.","Super disappointed with the last two seasons. The show felt rushed from the moment it was not based on the books. The things I didn't like: 1. Too much time spend on showing Kings Landing burning. And suddenly I am supposed to feel sorry for the civilians?! This show was never about the common people. So I didn't know what to feel about the completely irrational response by Dany. All the foreshadowing and convincing that she was a villan in her own story was not well executed. 2. If Jon was so duty-bound, his foremost duty as a true heir would be to be the king even if he didn't like it. What was the point of  him being a Targaryen?! 3. Would have loved to see Dany being the queen for more than 10 minutes and getting more sinister before being assassinated. Felt like with all her fire and fury, she was just getting started ( again the season was too rushed so much for waiting for 2 years). 4. If Bran didn't want to be the king he showed up all the way to Kings Landing to be the king?! Because what?! Why is he more qualified to rule... because he is memory bank? Wtf! And then he goes chasing dragons with his three eyed Raven power! That shows us how much he cares about people and ruling. 

The ending was totally half assed. If D&D were not in a mood to be show runners, HBO should have got someone else to continue and take more time ( seasons) to end it, but not make it so rushed and sloppy. While there are shows that definitely drag and should end sooner; this one ended too soon and in a bad way leaving me confused, unsatisfied and disappointed.","Nice list! I agree for the most part. 
Could you please elaborate more on #10 and #3? And what did the white horse symbolize? I didn't understand that scene.
 Also #20 really bothered me. The fact that area never used her assassin skills this season (except to horizontally leap 50 feet in the air) realllllly bothered me.","Agree with most part but about the 7th point.

They had to negotiate with grey worm. As king's landing was still under control of unsullied. If grey worm didn't think his queen got the justice she deserved, he wouldn't give kingslanding. Or a battle will follow.

Anyway Jon was still in custody of the unsullied. So, it is same situation of cersie in hands of highsparrow. You can defeat them, but Jon would be killed.so they had to negotiate with grey worm in my opinion.", #9 was my biggest complaint🙄,"I think the point about breaking the wheel was not having an heir. The Targaryen's stole the throne, too, so in that respect, Jon being an ""heir"" was irrelevant.","1.  Agreed

2.  Jon’s character has two imperatives: complete loyalty and the highest moral character. Danny’s actions put his two foundational characteristics in conflict. He couldn’t remain completely loyal and uphold moral standards and vice versa. He didn’t need Tyrion to help him see the light, but he did need external guidance to help him determine which character trait he would be able to abandon. 

3. I personally disagree. I thought it was one of the few we’ll-thought out pieces of poetic imagery (albeit not terribly deep) that has been used this season. I actually liked the horse as well, but that that one was far hokier. 

4. Yup. She just sent him on his way. 

5. I wondered this too. Here’s my take. Grey worm is a fantastic warrior. A true leader of soldiers. He is not and doesn’t pretend to be a leader of “men” or a ruler. He follows order and can give them, but he knows it’s not his place to make decisions and pass judgment.  He honestly didn’t know what to do with Jon. He knows he would start another war if he executes Jon (and despite his military prowess, knows that without a true ruler and financing, it’s not a war he could win). 

He probably didn’t send ransom demands or any such thing, and it took Sansa time to get word from Arya, gather her remaining army, speak with the other lords, and march on King’s Landing. That’s my guess. 

6. Yeah, seemed rushed to me for the most important decision any have made in a lifetime. 

7.  They (or at least Sansa/Arya/Sam want him back alive). If they simply attacked KL, Jon dies immediately. Plus, we know that not all of the lords were on board with releasing Jon. And even of those that would prefer that outcome, they may not have been willing to donate more troops to be slaughtered to rescue him or to incur a counterattack by the other houses. 

8. Cold and heartbroken - and probably a bit disappointed for letting Dany die on his watch. I wouldn’t say evil. His last scene of shopping off for Naarth to fulfill his promise to Missandei shows he’s not really evil. 

9.  If the idea of a “New” world order was on the top of their mind, one where king’s are chosen, it undermines the validity of that if the first “chosen” king was in fact an heir. Plus, Sansa knew she wanted an independent North regardless of who were to sit on the throne. Having Jon sit on the throne probably makes that more difficult as the northerners MIGHT bend the knee to their King in the North - which would make long-term independence virtually impossible. 

10. It was a side story because it never was a thing. There was never a real plot element there - it was character speculation and internet prognostication. 

11.  Agreed.  Misdirection. 

12. You say damned. My guess is of all the available options to him, that would have been in the top 3. That’s where his character belongs and he knows it. 

13. Can’t figure that out either. 

14. Arrr....

15.  Indeed.  He knew if anything changed, he might not end up where he did. 

16.  It doesn’t. But it does give him insight about the failures of others and how that impacts the world around him. He can avoid mistakes of the past. Doesn’t make him “qualified” but far more qualified than anybody who’s sat on the throne in millennia. 

17.  Agreed. “Rushed” may be an understatement. 

18. He was treated as a side plot because despite desires to the contrary, the NK WAS always a side plot. A large important sideplot, but a sideplot nonetheless. The final hurdle in sitting on the throne. 

19.  Not killing somebody DOES have its rewards. 

20. Yeah, I was totally bummed about that. Unless she secretly used the “face” of falling rocks to kill Cersei and Jamie. 

21.  I think Jon was used as a tension piece to sew discontent with Dany. His revelation started her down the path of losing her shit. Wasn’t the cause, but started to sew the seeds of doubt in her. Tyrion was a complete disappointment. But based on Bran’s comments to him, that was the point. But as a viewer, it was colossally disappointing. 

22.  Agreed. Agreed. I don’t think it was that inconclusive.  With the exception of Arya, we know where all the characters end up.","1. Daenerys' justification for mass slaughter is vague at best. She believes she freed a generation from tyranny by murdering them. She seems rather cogent, and I'm not going to believe that she is now downright delusional and crazy after barely two episodes of set up.

No. She was a bad person all along. Thirsty for power and justifying her actions. We just think her action are bad now because they're directed at westerosi people, not Meereese Noblemen. She was always about getting more and more power, having more and more people bend the knee to her. They had no choice. 

She burned Sam's dad and brother, because of that.   


Dany is not a good person. She never was.

&#x200B;

2. Why is Jon trying to defend Daenerys' actions against Tyrion's condemnations? I get he's conflicted, but Jon doesn't seem like the type of guy who needs a motivational pep talk from Tyrion to help him see that what Daenerys did was morally insane.

&#x200B;

A mix of love/infatuation/struggle. He thinks that if she's not on the throne, he will be. And he doesn't want that.

&#x200B;

3. The dragon had an intuition that the throne symbolized possessive political power, and that that was truly the thing that killed his mother. I understand the poetic meaning behind it but, like the horse at the end on E5, it just doesn't fit well.

Agree - it was a bit too much. 

&#x200B;

4 . Where is that white horse anyways? Arya is still around. Did she literally just use that horse for a two minute ride and then shooed it away once she left the city?

Lots of unanswered questions, this one is one of the least important, IMHO. I would've liked to know what happened to the crows Bran warged in during the battle of winterfell.

&#x200B;

5. There was a weird time gap between Daenerys' death and Greyworm's consultation with the Westerosi lords. It was a bit jarring.

Like always in the series. There was always time gaps. We have Tyrion's beard to show for it. 

&#x200B;

6. Selecting a king was mentioned off-hand in conversation and it literally takes ten minutes for everyone to unanimously come to a decisions based off of a one-minute inspirational talk from Tyrion.

Agreed, they had time constraint. At the same time...People would complaint that they talked for 25 minutes to chose a ne king.

&#x200B;

7. Why are the lords bargaining with Greyworm in the first place? Why don't they just forcefully take Jon. They could easily overwhelm him. What power does Greyworm have over them?

He has no power, but thousands of Unsullied. The last thing the lords want is other meaningless deaths. 

&#x200B;

8. Greyworm is evil.

Well...He saw the only persons who loved him die. First Missandei, with whom he was speaking of retiring to Naath, and Dany, who just named him Master of War. Oh, and he was raised to be a soldier.

&#x200B;

9 .None of Jon's siblings mention that their brother is the true heir? Wouldn't this help rally support for Jon's freedom?

Maybe. Maybe not. This would also bring more internal conflicts and the perpetuating of the wheel/another cycle of violence. They have to find another way to have him freed.

&#x200B;

10 . The Jon and Dany pregnancy side story was completely forgotten.

Yeah.

&#x200B;

11. Jon's parentage didn't do much else than establish drama between him and Dany. His parents were just used as a mechanism for Dany to be pissed off at him. Beyond that, Jon's parents aren't significant narrative-wise.

Getting Dany pissed off, conflicting jon betwee his two identities (Stark or targaryen), pushing him towards a throne he doesn't want. 

And setting up the Stark family dynamic, Ned's secret/Cat disdain of Jon, Jon being sent to the Night's Watch...

&#x200B;

12. Jon ends up reverting back to his season 1 self--damned to the Night's Watch.

&#x200B;

I don't think he's really going to the Night's Watch. There were only free folks at Castle Black. He lead them to the woods. I think he's going to stay beyond the Wall.

Why send him there? To appease the Unsullied and to make sure nobody who received a crow from Varys is plotting to have him on the throne.

&#x200B;

13. Why is there a Night's Watch after the dead are gone and the Wildlings are no longer a threat?

  
See my point in 12.

&#x200B;

14. Arya is a pirate.

No. She's fed up with that. And with all she's been through, and she's been through a lot, needs to see what else there is. She explored Westeros with the Hound/Hot pie and co, Essos as a faceless woman. She doesn't fit anymore.

&#x200B;

15 Bran knew thousands of innocents would die but I guess he couldn't do anything because fate or something.

Sometimes, negative things need to happen for the greater good. I compare it to Endgame: SPOILER - Dr Strange knew of 14-odd millions outcome, but only one worked. Most probably bran did the same.

&#x200B;

16. How does Bran being ""the memory of everything"" make him a qualified candidate for being king? Okay, sure, he doesn't ""want"" the throne which makes him less power hungry--but is that a strong enough determinant for being a good king?

Good point. Maybe so he doesn't make the same mistakes his predecessor made? I don't know about that. 

&#x200B;

17. It felt way too rushed.

Could've been longer. Everything could've been longer.

&#x200B;

18. All of this happening three episodes after the Night King is killed just feels off. The Night King was treated as some side plot that needed to be disposed of.

It was a side plot. The real threat is not the magic beings living on the other side of the wall. They can always be defeated. But humans, in all their complexities, are a threat. 

19. Bronn serves on the small council.

Why not? Who else? Edmure Tully? Robin Arryn? It's always a good thing to have the Lord of the Reach on the small council.

20. Arya never used her face power at all this season.

Why would she do it? She didn't need to. This season's arya was all about getting her identity back.

21.Jon and Tyrion didn't do much this season.

Jon saved the planet. Tyrion helped him stay alive afterwards and pushed the final button. They couldn't do anything because if they did, they'd be dead. See point 1

22. This was the final episode of a fantastic show. It felt rushed, shallow, and inconclusive.

Yes. Yes. No (please explain). No. 

People don't always get what they deserve. They tied up a lot of loose ends, we know what happens to the main characters, the wheel keeps on turning, even though it's a slightly different wheel now.","Agreed.  And definitely point 9.  You see, at that moment, only Jon, Tyrion, Sansa, Arya, Sam, and Bran know that Jon is the rightful heir.  Why does no one shout that out loud?  Why don't they use that to convince greyworm, etc.? 

It is a total disaster, tragedy, the 2nd half of S8.",WAAAA!!!!,And also everything ends with a bunch of white guys (except for Brienne) as “board members” for Bran’s kingdom... #realityhitGOT,"Change my mind. As someone who has been a fan since the second book the clash of Kings, the ending was perfect. If you disagree, you’re a fake ass fan.",I highly doubt greyworm would agree to Jon becoming king lmao,"I can’t believe they let TYRION (don’t get me wrong I love him) who was a prisoner/committed treason decide who should rule. What was the point of Jon’s heritage? What was the point of the starks and tyrion and Varys hyping up Jon like that only for him to be exiled back to where he was in S1? Being exiled for killing someone who A. Wasn’t the rightful heir. B. Slaughtered a city.

If it was a personal decision I would have been more content. “Hey Jon do you want to be king? You’re the rightful heir.” “No. I don’t want it. I’m tired of fighting. And I don’t belong here, I never have. I’m going to go be with the freefolk.” 

What was the point of Sansa being like, “what if there’s someone else? Someone better?” Only for Jon to get banished like that for doing what basically everyone wanted done?","There was really no reason for the Knights Watch anyway in my opinion. Nobody in the 7 Kingdoms even remembered or believed in the Wights. It was not until they brought one to KL that people believed they existed. So maybe the Knights Watch became more of a tradition than a necessity over time.  It’s almost like everyone just forgot why there was ever a Knights Watch.  It just became more of place to send your criminals (kind of like Australia).  

Plot holes were rare until season 7, in season 8 they seem to be everywhere.",Everything. EVERYTHING you said is true. How this Jon live? How did they choose Bran over Jon? Everyone wanted Jon to take power and then they forgot I guess.,"I thought it was implied Varys never got the chance to send those letters out. If that's the case, it makes his character a bit of a failure considering he's supposed to be the cunning spider. Also Sansa, Arya, Bran, Tyrion, and Sam know of Jon's heritage and they remain silent at the end.","It appeared as if the dragon intentionally was aiming at the throne. It didn't attack Jon, it attacked the throne. The throne was Dany's true murderer, the thing that drove her to tyranny. It's poetic but it didn't translate well into the show. I have to suspend the rather grounded animalistic nature dragons have in the show in order to make sense of why the dragon did that.

Jon and Dany were having a baby. It was even mentioned I believe in the first episode. It seems like the writers could have played with this more. Dany bears Jon's son or daughter, a future Targaryen. Is she truly cursed to never bear another child? Would she have died in child birth similar to Jon's mother? Did Jon have any remorse about killing Dany with regards to her potentially carrying their child? The writers never give us a conclusion--it seems like they just forgot about the whole thing.

The white horse is an age-old image for death used throughout literature and film. It comes from the book of Revelation where death is riding an ashen horse. I think, in a sense, Arya riding that horse at the end of E5 shows that she has seen death (the undead and the mass slaughtering of the innocent) and she knows its true nature. She no longer fears if but seeks to help others find peace in the face of it. Hence those various scenes of her trying to save whatever few lives she can in the burning city.",Jon would have been killed anyway! No way they would have let him live. Not one of them thought Dany was bad or wrong. Look at the rally five minutes beforehand. They would have slaughtered him. They all were willing to die for Dany. They would have killed him and whoever came after them for doing so.,"I was wondering that. It was a bit convenient. He murders Dany then we cut to the old council of drabness. How on earth did he survive either confessing or being captured? Either way, Grey worm would have killed him. Tyrion was in prison. There was nobody to protect him. The rest of the unsullied? The Dothraki? I think not. The only one who may have come to his defence was Drogon but he was gone. It was all really weird.",Me too.,"The entire idea of this “new” world and electing a ruler falls apart if the first “elected” ruler is actually a legitimate heir.  It would look like a complete sham and it sets a precedent. 

I agree with all the other horrible plot elements, but this one makes complete sense to me. Plus, and this can’t be ignored, the unsullied possessed Jon. There is NO way they would have released him free and clear. They even mentioned as much during the episode. Grey Worm didn’t even like a lifetime banishment, but accepted it.

And on top of that, Arya and Sansa (and Tyrion) knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Jon wouldn’t have accepted the nomination. So it would have been fruitless.",Didn’t Dany and Jon just have sex? Were there any proof that she got pregnant from that?,You mean the same as bran woudn't accept the thron?,"Yeah, exactly. Where was it mentioned in the first episode? Not being rude, just genuinely curious since it seems I missed it.","It was asked why didn’t Sansa and Arya bring up Jon. He told them many times specifically that he didn’t want to rule the 7 (er 6) kingdoms. They knew what the answer would be.  

And Sansa was being the pushy big sister assuming Bran wouldn’t want the throne. She never discussed that with him - that was obvious by his response.  They never had a conversation about the throne. They talked about being lots of Winterfell a year ago when he returned, but time had passed, things had changed with him since then AND they never asked him about the iron (er melted) throne specifically. It’s not just semantics. It matters.

On top of that, Sansa is a smooth enough political operator that she knew the Unsullied would not let Jon walk away free and clear - even had they voted him in. Tyrion was allowed to walk because despite the “betrayal,” his actions in no way harmed Dany. Jon killed Grey Worm’s best friend, mentor, savior, and queen. He and the unsullied would have gone to war (or just killed him) to prevent Jon from not only walking away, but being rewarded for his actions. 

They were looking for realistic solutions.","Precisely my point. In the first episode Jon says to Dany, after she tells him that she can never bear a child, that maybe the witch who cursed her was mistaken. There were obvious allusions. There was no answer.","I know,just jokingXD","Interesting about bran, i just wish we had a little more time to explore bran, who he is now and what his priorities are",I have believed for awhile Bran was evil. He used and manipulated the situation as the so-called 3-eyed raven for this end. So actually he murdered more people than Dany.,"""He just kind of showed up, no one really knows from where... but he's our king now."" It's like having an AI for leader...","I thought the former three eyed raven said you can’t change the past.....”the ink is dry”. As for seeing the future, Bran made it clear he knew he was going to be king: who else would be? Making Jon or Dany the ruler would’ve made everyone unhappy at an ending too happy. Sansa? Edmure? Sam? It could only be Bran. 

I do believe Sansa is power hungry. Despite her interactions with Joffrey and Ramsay, she’s been raised since episode 1 thinking she was going to be a queen. That said, I don’t think she’s necessarily evil. She’s made it clear to Jon’s and Dany previously that the north will not bend the knee again, even if it’s to her own brother. 

As for Tyrion, I think the moment he confronted Dany after the battle he’s been ready for death. He seemed completely ready for Grey Worm to kill him: oblivion is the best he can hope for. He doesn’t have anything to live for anymore. Life is literally his punishment.","I was wondering the same.. I can't even distinguish any type of sigils here. Throwing a wild guess that the first is some Lord of Riverrun or a Tully since his breastplate looks similar to the Blackfish (hope I wrote that right). Middle one could be some lord from the Reach? Since he doesn't have any additional winter protective layers like the third one does. And the third looks like a Northerner. 

I haven't read the books so my guess could totally off, but since the others were all allies with Daenerys, my best guess is that they're all from areas that were friendly to her and joined forces.","Well. the one on the left may be from the Riverlands, but he's definitely not the Lord of Riverrun.

It's been said before but I guess it bears repeating again....in Dany's head, taking out Cersei alone and acquiring the throne by peaceful means was not the recipe for a long-standing reign. The word that Jon is the rightful heir would spread and the people - who simply love Jon more - would make sure she is overthrown.

She said it herself: her only choice is to rule by fear, and (again in her mind) you don't instill true fear in your subjects with a surgical strike that only takes out a few, but with an all-out carpet bombing that takes out thousands.

People who think this is a better scene seem not to be paying much attention to the very words that Dany spoke.","I think this fix would've worked better without the Missandei footage, but I appreciate the intention!   
It's definitely the route I *wish* Dany would've taken; targeting Cersei and the Red Keep rather than roasting the innocents.","I mean. Sort of. It hasn’t been my feeling than Dany losing it and burning Kong’s Landing is totally out of character or that it doesn’t make sense. People who commit genocide don’t really make sense to the fully sane, normal population so J don’t expect the action itself to add up. What *did* bother me was that season has been so condensed that it feels like we took this turn without the necessary time devoted to Danny’s turn. Take Anakin’s story (as dumb as some of those movies were) - his fall was built up over three full movies so that by the time it happened it kinda made sense in that universe. What’s weird about Dany’s fall is that it didn’t have the room to breath it needed and so it feels a bit ham handed like we went from a violent but well meaning Dany to Hitler in the space of a couple episodes. They just needed about three more episodes to play out the politics with her and Jon and Sansa, etc and to make the Euron and Rhaegal stuff play out in a believable fashion and to set up the underlying rage that ultimately brings her to a tipping point in which she does something like this. I think Cersei needed some time to be played out as well so that she seems less whatever and a bit more malicious. Maybe some scenes where she’s having Qyburn experiment with wildfire on peasants or something.",Decent concept.

Except instead of the Mountain killing Missandei, Cersei has coerced some of King’s Landing civilians (whether through reward or by force) to do the deed.

It wasn’t great.,"Hey, look, someone who's actually been watching and paying attention to the show.","I don’t think anyone is arguing with that concept. The idea that the true tyrant/evil in the story is the frightened girl from the very beginning, who chooses fear to win her throne is a great concept. Most people aren’t annoyed it happened. The issue is the lack of relevant narrative setting that makes this decision seem:
(I) Coherent in Dany’s show arc: this descent into doubt and despair has only stemmed over 2-3 episodes MAX. There certainly has been plenty throughout the show to work with regarding Dany’s ambiguous morality and Targaryen tendencies, but I don’t want to rely on callbacks, I want to see a CAREFULLY CRAFTED and TRAGIC descent into tyranny. 
(II) You can’t hinge a massive character development point on saying - “oh, but she did say she will rule by fear!”. She gave the nod to Greyworm to call off the attack if they Crown forces surrendered. She was committed to sparing King’s Landing - that is clear to anyone watching the show. Her ‘snap’ happened upon seeing the Red Keep.
This is by far the most important plot point in the entire show - it needed to be done right. Just from a narrative perspective it just didn’t work for me.","Agreed. The point is there shouldn't be an immediate scapegoat for Daenerys' action. People want that so they can rationalize the those actions with their own morality. This was about becoming a true tyrant. A moment of premeditation and clarity. Where all the emotion, the sadness, the rage, coalesce into a scene where conquest and the seizure of power becomes paramount. In the world the story has molded it may have been the most pragmatic approach Daenerys could have taken, at least in terms of her objective from day one, which was to sit on the throne. Yes, it may be viewed as ""madness"" through the lens of morality, a release of years of pent up rage (much of it warranted rage). But objectively her actions met her goal. And it achieved the mantra of many a dictator or tyrant, ""better to be feared than loved"".","you talk as if every letter is to be taken seriously in the show, okay maybe you'll be the one to explain to me the point of bringing back jon by the lord of fire since he's so useless through an entire season? Or why the master of whisperers would commit himself into an open-to-public treason? Or the other plot holes that makes no sense? It's becoming a gimmick now in GoT, characters are dying for the sake of ""dying"" and recreating that ""nobody is safe"" argument, not because there is a story about it, the reason why ned's death was so strong is because it IS the story to many  


People are making excuses now for D&D to make sense when it's convenient, yet conveniently overlook their mistakes, this is what the fan base of GoT have come to, those who admit they are not enjoying it anymore and those that are apologetic towards the writers that have gone lazy and want zombie polar bears goddammit!","I'm supposing it shows that Daeny IS mad.  I don't like it, but we're not supposed to like it.","Exactly how I feel. Her descent into madness was totally a thing I could have believed if given more room to breathe. 

I also think that her destruction could have made a BIT more sense if the opposing army hadn't surrendered with the bells.",This is why we can't have nice things...,"The original post changes WHOM Daeny attacks, which is valid.

This is what prompts her to attack the red keep and destroy her ENEMY and NOT barbecue INNOCENTS, who she has stood up for thus far. This decision however leads to the collateral damage of the death of some innocents while burning the red keep to the ground. Dany makes this conscious decision in a fit of rage, which can create the conflict later on between Tyrion/ Jon about this very decision.","Adding a couple more zeroes for ya... Because truly, this ending is the only one that makes any sense...",Lol. Touché,Well we can only use the footage from the show to fix this diabolical season. The concept is what’s important,"Its just a re-edit, but this is my original edit. I put the end credits in the end to show that thats the end of the episode in my mind. What makes you think this is stolen work?","I think you hit the nail right squarely on the head in terms of the way people are feeling. Yes, the seeds were definitely there, however, there was also a period where it seemed she had grown past her worst instincts, of domination, and revenge.

I am rewatching the series right now, and given how close we are to recent events, the seeds were planted very well in the early seasons. The problem is that there was also a period of time in the later seasons, let's say from when she fled Meereen on Drogon, to when she arrives in Winterfell with Jon. During this time we see her become a more benevolent leader, someone who appears able to work with others, and work for the greater good. Heck, she comes across as such a genuinely good leader that people in IRL want to name their babies after even.

But then, all of a sudden, beginning with the Battle of Winterfell, the pendulum swings wildly back again, to where she was emotionally during the period of time between losing her dragons to the warlocks of Qarth, and her struggles attempting to rule Meereen. Again her need to dominate and control take center stage. But the problem is that we are not shown the motivation, we are asked to simply accept it. To me, this is like a mathematician asking us to accept a scientific theory with no proof. It simply doesn't work.

Before she fled Meereen, and began her odyssey of transformation, we absolutely saw evidence that she could be cruel and irrational. For example, taking all the heads of the great families of Meereen into the dragon crypt and randomly burning one of them to death for something he may not even have been guilty of.

Vulture Online actually has an article that talks about this same topic that you mentioned, and explores it in some detail:  [https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-daenerys-mad-queen-trope.html](https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-daenerys-mad-queen-trope.html)","I've read the opinion that her descent was gradual, she might've either been dissuaded or lost her supporters (except by fear).  

I can understand that pos.  It's arguable.","Well if you truly think that her arc from normal to mad was 2-3 episodes, then I don't know what to tell you other than you haven't been paying enough attention for the past 7 seasons. The seeds were planted early on, the signs there there, her words an intentions definitely hinted at her becoming exactly like her father ever since she was still with Khal Drogo. Yes, the straws that finally broke the camel's back came fast and hard in the past few episodes, but that's also by design, since spacing out the losses of her loved ones only gives her more time in between to recover mentally. Losing Jorah, Missandei, Viserion, Rhaegal, the love of Jon all in such quick succession was exactly the catalyst to make her lose her fucking mind. In fact, had they stretched out the tragedy across multiple seasons, not only would her descent be less steep and thus less out of control, but also far more predictable. And I guess that's why I don't understand people who are complaining that it happened out of nowhere (even though it did not): part of the appeal of this show is that it to sweep the rug from under your feet and have you beat yourself up for failing to see the signs. 

But again, if you missed the signs then I suggest re-watching older episodes or catch one of the many videos on Youtube that will help you understand. [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9JutLGbFR0) for starters. Then [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TO2zjSYivS4) is also informative.","https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bo7l4u/spoilers_all_of_the_foreshadowing_that_lead_up_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Is it really surprising she did this though?",But how is that falling into madness? That is a targeted strike with collateral damage,If you like predictable Disney-style storytelling then yes this is an improvement.,"> What makes you think this is stolen work?

LOL you can't be serious. Did you spend the millions of dollars to shoot these scenes?

Normally I wouldn't care about creative rights a fun little fan re-edit (after all, it's just a bit of fun right) but for you to think you didn't steal anything to do it is crazy.","I’m familiar with the show & books. And foreshadowing is not the same as character development. Yes, the show has hinted at Daenerys fiery temperament and need for advisors to stall her worst impulses, but among all the bad - the rest was good! Freeing Slavers Bay, offering mercy, locking her dragons up, refusing to attack King’s Lansing, breaking the wheel. There’s a reason people cheered and supported her up until last episode. I’m not saying it should be dragged out across seasons, but this is certainly an arc that deserved fruition across a normal 10 episode season at least. Robb Stark’s story began with him as a respected battle commander, to losing the respect of his men and allies through countless traceable mistakes over several seasons - the Red Wedding, while horrific, felt earned: inevitable, even. You’re right, the seeds were there - but they show didn’t spend the time to properly nurture and develop them before showing the conclusion. Again, in my opinion this is not a problem with the LACK of development, but simply an issue that has developed due to the 6 episode limit.
If you can truly say that this season hasn’t felt rushed and sloppy in a few areas relating to character, then I really do envy you.","I don't think people are complaining, so much as pointing out legitimate concerns. That doesn't mean they haven't been ""paying enough attention"", it just means their opinion doesn't match yours. Nothing wrong with that.",She doesn’t have to do this. She makes a conscious decision to destroy the Red Keep in the heat of the moment knowing that innocents will die. Thus far she has shown no signs of willing to sacrifice the innocent for her personal gain. But here she does so. This is not a full on descent into madness but a subtle turn to recklessness & cruelty that Jon and Tyrion will perceive as unstable and resembling madness.,Anything is an improvement over the current offering. Unless you like clueless story-telling with character motivations that make no sense ...,Ofcourse im not taking credit for anything related to the show i was under the impression that you were accusing me of stealing this edit. This is a visual spectacle and i would never claim anything they did as my own. Just a misunderstanding i guess.,"Uh, ok.

But remakes never usually include people from the original show and i dont see any spin off taking place during the time of AGOT to where they could come back anyway","Also you are taking the jamie comments way out of context if you think that was him voice frustrations. Of course actors want to try to do different things or think their characters would act differently, doesnt mean he hated the show or however you put it. Hes also liked posts on twitter defending the show but guess weree gonna ignore that or just chalk it up to d&d have his wife kidnapped and he has to say good things about the show now.",The petition is funny but I did sign it.,"Actors have normally nothing but praise to say about the writing of the stuff they are in. In the very same interview, he praises the final season. Never said he hated the show. I'm just pointing out that he obviously cares about the direction his character was going or else he wouldn't have said anything at all. You did a whole lot of dancing to get back to the same conclusion I did lol that very few (if any) would return. Also, the entire concept that a remake should or would be done is a little ridiculous IMO.","That’s fine and all to feel for the actors/crew, but I don’t know how anyone can be happy or satisfied with what has happened here, and I say this as someone who really did stay optimistic until the last episode.

It is just so obviously apparent that D&D just wanted to bail out and start the Star Wars movie, and that was far more important to them than finishing what they started in an appropriate way.

I rarely see anyone criticizing the actors or crew. The vitriol is directly aimed at those two ass holes.

They have straight up RUINED so many characters and their arcs.","....As the camera slowly zooms out, through a blue window, continuing, until it takes the shape of an eye, then a face, and an entire body, a giant named Macomber, striding along the moors bordering the always winter..

Edit: No hate to RD, he's a musical mastermind.",These scene is chilling,Dany sort of forgot that fire kills people,"Everybody defends her actions in the last episode, but I don't think anybody is suggesting it's not the path she was always going to go down in the narrative. The issue is that she went from 1-10% in the first 7 seasons, and then 10-100% in the last. There's a HUGE difference between wanting to execute the leader of a terrorist organization undermining your rule and committing mass genocide against a million people.","Mad, so from this we can see the step by step punishments Dany has taken/ increased to what she thinks is right. I know the show is trying to make me not like Dany after the latest episode but I gotta say I'm enjoying her character arc and still want to see her on the throne!","This was always her path, she showed signs of being a psychopath from the beginning...they laid the groundwork and only a few picked up on it early, the rest had to see this coming for the last two seasons. The ones mad are probably the same ones that dislike Sansa, the most developed character in the show and strongest, wisest, of all those vying to be a leader. If you’re mad about the woman lead being made into a villain you’ve totally missed out on Sansa developing into the better choice and aren’t giving her enough credit.",I MISS Barristan!,"_They’re just sleeping. Look at that little guy, he’s all tuckered out._","To be fair, its really like a 1-40% in season 1-7.5 then 40-100% in 7.5-8. She did burn everybody in slavers bay, and has to be repeatably counseled against her instincts which are always to kill now and ask questions later. Then from season 7.5 (when she gets to westeros) and on we see her lose battles, lose children, lose advisors and close friends, and lose pretty much her whole support system. Then she sees that her whole image of a place where everyone loves her and is calling for her to be queen is not reality. No one loves her, and she gets betrayed by the person she loves. And when the bells start ringing in kings landing signifying the enemy surrender, she feels cheated of taking out all of the anger that she had been pointing towards cersei who had been pivotal in the demise of missendei, her trust of tyrion, and the loss of her first two battles. So she doesnt feel as though she had won, on the contrary she feels powerless. And that is what makes her snap. She regains that feeling of power the one way she knows how.

Unlike most TV shows (that I know of), Game of Thrones is telling one large story, instead of different stories per season, if that makes sense. 

With that being said, I’m sure there are multiple YouTube videos that have recapped what’s happened so far in the series that you could get away with.","The reason behind the hype for the End of the show is from years and years of being along for the journey and being apart of every heartbreak and payoff of the show. What sets Game of Thrones apart from other shows is the development from the very first scene, all the way up until the last. The sheer scale of the show is unmatched. Almost every character, every story, every scene has a meaning whether it be to the story itself or a metaphor to a greater mean in life itself.

If Dany had accepted surrender and then the truth about Jon had been revealed, the people could have rioted to have Jon on the throne, like they supported Margery over Joffrey. 
At that point she would have had an even harder time ruling peacefully. She had to show her power to make a point. As they say: all is fair in love and war.","Very good points but the end all be all is yes it’s all John snows fault. (Tyrion made her look weak though). John picked family over duty and for no reason at that. It didn’t even benefit him (Or at least what he states are his goals). Shit why did he even tell Danny like lol shut the fuck up. Bran and Sam knew forever but the second John knows EEEEEEEEE. 

Danny should have killed the starks, John included. (Preferably the white walkers and then-after he turned her down proving his deception) 
Then just blasted cerci personally. Maybe even that whole castle but not the town. Blam ggwp",How is Arya not a Hero?,"Ned was the series’ archetypal hero, and GRRM purposefully killed Ned early on as a statement about Ned stark-like heroes.

That is disgusting, cruel, unnecessary, and did nothing to bring back her loved ones.  Were they innocent?  Not in her mind. But does that seem just?","Well I see it as a poetic justice. Her family was invited as guests for dinner and were slaughtered like animals after they were fed. In return, she slaughtered the sons who killed her family and fed them to the man who made the call (I don’t recall her feeding the pie to everyone else). She also spared the women and children who she knew were innocent, which Dany didn’t do.","In fiction? Yes. Yes it does. Daenerys murdering these people seems less just, but not unexpected.

&#x200B;

Danny burns King’s Landing to ashes, executes Tyrion for treason (letting Jaime escape).

Jon revolts against Danny’s actions. News that Jon is the true heir spreads. Danny decides to execute Jon.

Just before Jon’s execution, Arya saves Jon by changing identity, both escape to Winterfell. Danny tries to capture them, but fails.

Danny declares war against Winterfell and Sansa. Prepares her army to attack.

Jon and Arya reach Winterfell. They come to know about Danny’s plan to destroy them. So they resort to the only possible way to defend themselves ....

... like how the children of the forest did to protect themselves against the first men

Pre-final scene (King’s Landing) : Danny starts with dragon, unsullied and Dothraki to finish Winterfell. Fire in her eyes.

Final scene (Godswood, Winterfell) : The four stark children around the tree. Bran and Sansa watching, Jon against the tree ... Arya plunges a dragonglass into Jon’s heart ... Jon’s eyes turns Blue.

(Playing Ramin Djawadi’s “The Night King” in the background mixed with Stark music)

The end

So if on side you get burns, wounds from whatever is flying around, wounds from the shock gone through your body, that can stop your heartbeat, or cause internal bleeding, lack of air ( that is consumed by the fire) But there, right in front the mouth of Drogon, you are turned in a piece of coal.

If Bran wanted to go back and change things for Dany and Jon etc. it would change too many things in the timeline to the point where bran would never become the three eyed raven changing everything. It would become a paradox and then suddenly it’s a doctor who episode with sci-fi themes and no fantasy themes.

Something I noticed was that during episode 5 of season 8 there is a character attempted to enter King’s Landing that looks a lot like Bran (it’s the scene where the mom and daughter are trying to enter).

In Essos, she was a Breaker of Chains, and the people there loved her for it. In Westeros, she became an Imposer of Chains, intending to force her reign on a free people, who never asked for it. She then whines that the people don't love her, when she's done everything possible to drive them away.

She had a gift for inspiring love from people who'd been enslaved, but it was ineffective among people who were all born free. In choosing to lead by fear, she shows she has no clue as to where her appeal originally came from. She's come to think she's simply entitled to it by birth. She's in a death spiral.","And what atrocities had the citizens of KL committed to deserve mass murder? Not welcoming her with open arms, a woman they know nothing of?

Understandably, she wasn’t like her father back when she was the breaker of chains, so she probably felt that people in Westeros would feel that way about her.

Of course it won't. Many things were left out of the show and a lot of it is hard to translate to screen. 

With the books, you get the character's inner thoughts. It might be easier to understand their motivations. Dany's progression fron Mhysa to Mad Queen might make more sense when you read her POV.","Rushed? How is it rushed?

D&D are not bad writers, they just made the mistake of rushing it.",Well the books are instead written by a guy who has no clue how to finish.,"For some people I’m sure it’s easier to write for the screen than as a novel. The issue is that D&D chose to end it in a shorter amount of time than necessary, when HBO was willing to pay for a longer series. So they forced themselves into a corner and are tying it up in ways that feel incomplete and are unsatisfying.

Look, I like the series. These last two seasons are subpar in regards to the writing. All this is really doing is making me excited for GRRM to hopefully finish the books.","From an article...

Martin said: “The series has been... not completely faithful. Otherwise, it would have to run another five seasons.”

In the new interview he added: ""You know, it’s complex. I’m a little sad, actually. I wish we had a few more seasons.""

All of his beautifully complicated plots needed room to breathe, so the ending would have felt completed/earned. D&D were just not up to the task. I'm sure there's legal means, but why didn't they consider other writers? Idk, GRRM does hold fault for delaying the books for long.","From the wiki:
> Writer's assistant Dave Hill... suggested to Benioff and Weiss that Olly join the Night's Watch, because he had nowhere else to go, and to kill Ygritte during the Battle of Castle Black for dramatic sense. Benioff and Weiss were so impressed with this suggestion that they promoted Hill to write an episode script in Season 5

They're bad writers with a bad sense of what was actually strong about the show long term. They understood the directing craft well enough to translate the solid source material into the kind of punchy, cinematic marketing that was so enjoyable. In that, they were essential. But they didn't understand the core of the characterization or integrity of the drama that made it appealing, only the flash and presentation. It's not just that it's rushed, the longer they handled the source material and the more they crafted the teams and made original creative decisions, the more they steered it off course. 

But many franchises have the same problem. Just like the original author would do poorly if given the sole power to produce and direct, the best directors and producers do poorly when later given the sole power to author.","I agree. I don't believe D&D are bad writers, but they obviously wanted the show to come to a close soon. And it's very upsetting they didn't take the time to do it right.

If this was really the case, I wish they meet up with GRRM and got other writers in the mix to help finish it up.","I guess I’ll agree to disagree.

b) If he had finished the next two books, he would have let them use those books and the show wouldn't have sucked so much since season 4.

c) it's a ridiculous thing to say/believe.","Olly was an original creation that characterized the future direction d&d wanted to take the writing.

You had the actual plot and characters take a sideline to the desire to inject drama into a scene, with increasingly less setup.

In GoT they chose to do, and know they need to deal with it.","It shouldn't be feeling sorry for them though. There shouldn't be pity BECAUSE they're strong. 

Empathy is a better word. Pity implies too much weakness. It really feels like in different circumstances, everything could have been fine.

She's a woman in a culture that doesn't really respect women even when they're brilliant but other than that? 

She had Jaime. She was wealthy. Her father wasn't loving but that's not necessarily abuse. She still had agency. She had the ability to make decisions.

When I think of pity, I think of people who have things happen to them without choice. Like the people of a Westeros. I pity them. The civilians in Kings Landing I pity.

""Tywin is known for his stoic, tough as nails, pragmatic, cunning and calculating demeanor, but also his ruthless, cold, manipulative, power-hungry, and often unfettered attitude, even for his family. The only person he held any sentiment towards was his late wife Joanna (whom he loved dearly), having died giving birth to their son Tyrion. Since then he expressed disdain towards Tyrion for the death of his wife, as well as for shaming Tywin and their family by being born a misshapen dwarf. \[...\]  Ironically, Tywin's harsh actions and unwillingness to serve as a caring father figure have resulted in severe emotional problems in all three of his children, who are all terrified of him. Jaime and Cersei have been having an incestuous sexual relationship since they were very young, partially due to the lack of any loving parental relationship either of them had. Tywin actually spent most of their lives away in King's Landing serving as Hand of the King, and with their mother dead, his children were functionally raised by servants. Tywin only sporadically visited his home at Casterly Rock, and on the occasions when he did return he would deal out severe punishment for any transgressions his children committed while he was away.""

Overall the episode was ok, Jamie and Cersei end could have been more dramatic.",I thought it was pretty good!,"simply, who didn't like this episode. I don't know what else could do.  
""The Bells"" was magnificent at all sides. 

I liked the fights scenes. I get nervous angry and sad, sometimes I felt happy.

 They showed Daenerys as mad now to make the road for Jon, it bothers me to see Daenerys in this way. But any other way it doesn't look right to me. 

Now I'm ready to see the scene of ""Daenerys' death""",I can't believe they are dead unless I see the corpse.,"I really was happy that the Hound talked some sense into Arya. I am going to miss them two together. 😭😭😭

I’m sad that Varys died, even though I knew he would this episode, but I still didn’t want it to happen. 😭 He really did want what was best for the realm. 

I enjoyed this episode minus that Euron went after Jamie?? Like why? He literally just got away from being burnt alive and then decided to take on Jamie... 

I loved seeing Aryas more vulnerable side. Everyone said she changed so much, but I’ve always known she was really just the same amazing girl from season 1 episode 1, just better equipped to take people out if needed and to keep her loved ones safe and get revenge on those on her list. That’s why her and Jon has such a deep connection growing up because they both have had a good heart since the beginning. IMO at least. 

I really hope Cersei didn’t die that way. I realllly want her death to be by someone who deserves that revenge and do see her finally perish. (Which is like everyone) I have no sympathy for that women what so ever. 

And with everything that has happened to Daenerys through out her journey to get the iron throne, her crazy has slowly been building, and then bam she snapped and went full Targaryen. Apparently the coin landed on the wrong side. Lol. 


Edit for more thoughts.","I thought it was good, really depressing in a  ""if you think this has a happy ending you haven't been paying attention"" kind of way but a strong episode","Are we sure Cersei and Jamie are dead? It was so anti-climactic.  I kind of wonder whether there’s some kind of way they are hiding in the rubble or something, or at least Cersei.",I've read enough sci-fi/fantasy/comic books to be conditioned into thinking that if you don't see a dead body a character may not be dead.

(How and where it came from is beyond),I know it's cheesy af but I can't help but hope the finale won't be quite as easy for the people that like to make metaphorical analogies or whatever you call them with world events and stuff.,"Anyone else get reminded of that moment in LotR when Galadriel is briefly offered the one ring to rule them all?

Curious if we will get any closure at all for him.","Yeah..to fast and cowardly for a woman inherently evil. Them dying together I imaged, but different. 

Also, I was confused seeing her look sad/distraught when looking at the dragon flying over the city burning innocent people. Wouldn't she be smirking somewhat? She hated those people, now she also turned the supposedly ''peaceful'' Daenerys in a murdering monster. That should've given her some kind of satisfaction no?","It wasn't what I expected, but it had its points.

I did expect her steely composure to break when she finally saw Jamie. She'd have a moment to let go, and reveal that the hard exterior was more for show than reality.

There might be a certain satisfaction in seeing her last moments being that of a whimpering child, rather than as a defiant queen.","Ok, I've slept on it, and I'm revising my response. While I do find it fitting in a sense, I definitely think it should have been more dramatic and we actually *see* her (and Jaime) die... not just the dust. I think watching her lose it emotionally was awesome. I half expected Jaime to stab her or break her neck... but he really was just hardcore addicted to Cersei.",I thought it was actually quite fitting. We finally get to see Cersei incredibly vulnerable. The city literally destroys her. And Jaime dies in the arms of the one he loves.,">And didn't he kill a Northman to prevent a rape? 

  
Yeah he did. I'm kind of hoping that there might be more to having that scene in the episode. Having it there on it's own is all good too of course. But I think it would be pretty neat if it started something. My theory is that the woman he saved will seek him out later to thank him and in the process find out his name/true heritage etc and then go around and spread the word about what an amazing man he is for saving her and preach about how it's him that deserves the iron throne. Maybe it will end up being apart of what makes Jon go ""I don't want this... but I need to do this"" so he'll take out Dany and become the next ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.",Brienne lost my interest when she hooked up with Jamie. I was *so* disappointed in her. Shame on the writers for making her into yet another female who became weak over love and was immediately overshadowed by her guy once he was done with her. Ugh.,"The Hound took out a unkillable monster... he wins, regardless if he died","> The perfect ending to the Lannister family name

Tyrion still kicking,  yeah?","> New best battle episode?

Nothing will beat BotB for me. The closures in this fight (ep5) were too fast for my liking. Ramsay, a torturing psychopath, got more closure than some characters that were in GoT from the start.",Its a shame Jamie wasn't a hero in the end but fitting for got characters and their many flaws,"Ups and downs to the episode. I felt like Veris reduced himself to a Ned Stark move by approaching John in the open on the beach. They did a great job of giving that under attack feeling, but it went for awhile for sure. I think Bran intended to let this happen to get John to split from Dany, and I think Bran was warging in as the horse Arya rode off on because he has a purpose for her. This next episode still somehow probably involves the Winterfell characters","This also raises the question of how much fire can a Game of Thrones' dragon produce?  Do dragons get dehyrdrated (or denapalmed, whatever the term would be) from shooting out fire non-stop for 30 minutes and need to replenish their internal chemical reservoirs (like a snake replenishes it's venom) or is it just unlimited fire? #questionsthatwillneverbeanswered","I think nothing, finally a good episode for me this season!",Truth. Tough look for r/asoiaf... yikes,I think this episode shows she really is more human and more arya than some magical assassin,"I think she mentally took a step back, asked herself if she really wanted to be like Sandor Clegane, and said, ""Not Today...""

The book states her eyes/Targaryen eyes are usually violet.,God forbid you actually think that.

Too many actually.",My only writing issue this episode was Euron's last words.,Perhaps? I mean his death was so sudden. I presumed Cersei would have had more of a reaction to that but it is what is. Also my issues with the writing are with  certain character arcs but that like anything is debatable and that entirely fair that you think differently.,"Well a lot of fans wanted it to happen, so it did for better or worse. And While it was prolonged, I will say though the cinematography and choreography in that bit was really well done. I enjoyed the transition between him and Arya.","Yeah Greyworm is loyal to dany and nothing else, he doesn't care about the politics",I got a 404 error...,Hahahaha,She was selfish to the very end. She was distraught looking at the city because she realized she was losing her power. She only cared about her and her baby’s well being.,"Yeah, but not sure how much Tywin would approve of his actions and how they affect the “family name”.","Exactly! One thing I love about Thrones is that the characters let us down. Too often are they expected to rise above expectations and be a hero (Jon, Dany, Jamie, etc). But Thrones sticks to their flaws. Lovely storytelling",I’m starting to think that Bran just doesn’t give a shit.,I liked it too,Tough look for a bunch of people on another subreddit who didn't like an episode? What a bizarre thing to care about.,"But it ignores her years of development? She killed Walder Frey and his entire family proudly, and killed many others. She was trained extensively, but still somehow ends up in the crowds being pushed about. This bothered me, she should be smarter than being caught in the chaos.","Typical egotistical, tyrannical, psychopath. It was comical but true to his character -  let’s not forget he was into all of this just to bone the queen. 
I’m only upset they didn’t play the realization that the baby was not his but Jamie’s a bit more.",Oh yeah- Euron was the worst character of the entire series. He was self-important and a joke even to Cersei.  His death should have looked more like Qyburns though.,I agree with this completely. I actually really enjoyed this episode a lot. Euron's last words was the only problem I had with the episode.,"They have been playing to the audience lately but that's fine.   On the plus side, I think nobodywins can officially take first place in the reddit office pool given that the iron throne no longer exists....","He was interested in vengeance which was Danys motivation as well. Showing us again, that she is not the best ruler for the 7kingdoms.","I think the later seasons have helped in some people forgetting that, with everyone teaming up for the NK war their human flaws were put on hold, but now they are back lol",I don’t care. I think it’s pretty funny. It’s a show.,"Yeah you've got a point, but then again has she ever really been a situation thats that overwhelming? The walder Frey thing was much more slow and controlled, while that was absolute chaos, and after reuniting with her family and Clegane who finally helped her realise that she's not some emotionless assassin, but Arya Stark who has a lot of connections to the world. To me that was her character actually coming full circle and realising how much value there is in every individual life (thinking specifically when she tries to save all those mums and kids hiding in kings landing) Her being a badass cold assassin maybe isnt the goal, isn't the 'best' her character can be, maybe being the emotional, caring, girl trying to save common folks lives is what it really means to be human, to be arya. Now I'm just rambling, i do respect your view but I've always found people who get their 'strength' from being disconnected for humanity and their emotions to be a bit unsettling myself so I quite liked her in this episode and saw her actions and responses as a strength to her characters endgame","I think she mentally turned a corner and saw for the first time that merely seeking revenge was a path with a dead-end, and that she deserved more. The Hound earned a kind of redemption in caring about someone else before he went on to die.

I do agree that she should have been smarter than to let herself be swept away in a fleeing mob. If she did it after she got her head smacked, then maybe. But not when she did. I suppose the writers simply found it convenient to show the chaos and suffering that was going on, through the eyes of a character we care about. 

In taking more time to show the carnage and suffering, I think the writers wanted to make it painfully clear that there's no way to justify Dany's rampage, especially on innocent townsfolk, and especially-especially after the surrender signal had been given. Looks like the final episode will involve dealing with a Mad Queen, rather than her coronation...","AGREED! I was sure he was going to mention getting her pregnant and Jaime saying, ""Nope. Me first"" and then killing him. That was a bummer.",Which sucks cause he was one of my favorite characters in the books.,"That an the coincidence of him and Jamie being in the same place, but I thought it was a strong and depressing episode",I think it still exists. She didn't destroy the entire areas. There's definitely a throne left. Not sure if anyone will *rule* from it but it'll be there.,"Yeah, and they both were justified in their anger but their actions went too far, especially for people in those leadership roles","I like your take on revenge being a path with a dead-end. From the beginning she was motivated by her “list”. It’s what kept her going and made her who she is. Now her character has matured and been able to move away from vengeance and realize the importance of humanity, similar to that of Jon’s from the start.","Woah, it was so badly written in the show I thought he was someone they made up for plot development. 

Well that makes me wanna read the books.",Argh,>!Hindsight is 20/20!<,"I love this guy. People, if you haven't been following Rhys Stark's story, you're really missing out!!! He provide a wonderful prism to view the Stark family through. Reminds me a bit of Dunk & Egg!! (that's a compliment!)","No- they've done a very poor job of explaining what the purpose of the 3ER even is and most viewers don't have a clue. They expect Bran to see the future and predict the enemy's actions and tell the other Starks how to alter events and thus win ""the game.""   
That is NOT his job.  He is a repository with a world view so broad as to encompass generations. He is not a day to day type guy any longer.  
Hell, he's not even BRAN any more.","No, and in fact at this point I doubt we actually ever seen Bran again as it’s a race to the finish line...

His importance and the lives sacrificed for him doesn’t make any sense now. He did nothing to help defeat the Knight King but be bait. It’s pathetic.","Agreed. It’s not even about Rhaegul dying, but the way it was done. Would have been much better if it was a consequence of Dany’s actions, such as choosing to attack the fleet upon seeing it. 

The show was always about the consequences of doing what you felt to be right, or because of your ambition. From Ned losing his head to Jon and Rob being murdered. They did what they thought was right and suffered for it. 

The deaths in this season are hollow, and only served to help the show finally end.","There are characters in this story whose main purpose seems to be to give other characters information that they otherwise had no means of getting. It can be an unsatisfying use for a character, and Bran seems to be one of them.

Both Littlefinger and Varys did this to some extent, with their spies revealing choice information at choice times, and Littlefinger orienting Ned Stark (and the entire audience) to the the ins and outs of King's Landing. Of course, they gave Varys and Littlefinger some other purposes too, to make each of their characters colorful and distinct, and to conceal their roles as information sources.

Bran, OTOH, seems to have been inserted to give us information that couldn't come from spies, and so needed to come by supernatural means. I agree that he's unsatisfying as a character, and so I tend to see him just as one of the useful fixtures in the story, like a dragonglass axe, or Arya's iron coin...","Yes, his boring character and monotone will all be worth it if he turns out to be Keyser Söze. 

And we see a slo mo montage of him manipulating events from the moment he becomes the three eyed raven until the finale, where he is crowned the king.","Absolutely this! I don't really understand why they've invested so much time in the series to this character, only for no resolution to be provided.

Maybe we will learn more in the next two episodes but at this point I'm not hopeful.","I can understand that serious fans of the show find it really harsh to hear this kind of criticism, but the fact is:

A) it's your right as a fan to have your own opinion

B) its a legitimate critique and one that hopefully HBO takes to heart as it moves out to produce additional content....","I’ve been a fan of this show for years. I’m the kind of guy that’s watched all the history and lore in the box sets. I can accept things are never going to be perfect, but the complete abandonment of story lines and character arcs are mind boggling.","I'm with you. It would be one thing for a couple minor issues, but most of the blunders have been ""unforced errors"" so to speak. For example, the effect created by the Dothrakis, when they charged the horde of wights, it was amazing, and conceptually, it belonged. But they could have gotten the same effect by having the Dothraki properly positioned, on the flanks of the main fighting force by the castle. They could have charged in from each side as the wights advanced, and the same effect of their lighted swords being extinguished could have been had... And in this way, the suspension of disbelief would have been possible. The same goes for Euron shooting Rhaegal out of the sky. In the late-middle ages, which is the time frame this show is based on, a castle like Dragonstone would have had lookouts, and guards, and watchmen, and scouts positioned from miles away from the main castle and all along the coast. There is no way that Euron's fleet would have gotten anywhere close to Dany in broad daylight. (not to mention the fact that from the height she was flying, she should have seen Euron's fleet)... But, with a little backstory, they could have shown Euron's forces ambushing Dany's lookouts, and slaughtering them, the director could have even shown it post scene if they wanted to maintain the surprise.. Personally, I wasn't even surprised by that scene for some reason. It was done so suddenly that it lost its impact...","4x10 aired on Fathers Day. This would be awesome, though I'm not sure I'm ready to say good bye to Jaime tonight...",Please be as painful as possible,"Yea!!! I was thinking the same thing. Actually, if Daeny dies, it will be the same thing.

They handled the Ghost goodbye perfectly. People are upset that they didn’t have a sappy and emotionally satisfying goodbye, but that was the point. Jon is conflicted and feeling incredibly guilty about leaving the North and potentially abandoning his Stark family. He’s pained because of this. His relationship with Ghost is perhaps the simplest and most direct manifestation of his relationship with the North and his family. It’s fitting that he has such a guilty conscience that he couldn’t even face Ghost to say goodbye. That’s the whole point.

Sansa arc is strange because of how everyone on the show somehow knew Lil Finger was a schemer instead of appearing as everyones harmless friend who actually manipulates you into conflict with others. So trying to push the narrative that shes like Lil Finger is so awkward and illogical because she openly cares about her family and people over her self interest. Episode 2 was the only saving grace of the season but everything that has followed hasn’t aligned with the setup that episode provided. 

Tyrion reduced to dick jokes and a delivery method for subversion. 
1.) Repeat belief that Tyrion is smart
2.) He openly recommends his course of action
3.) Subvert everyones expectation when it backfires (every single Tyrion plan has gloriously failed)

Danny forgets who she became in essos (breaker of chains) and became a really one-dimensional character since her westeros arrival. They’re now trying to push this lame mad queen narrative. Sooo the person who wanted to bring freedom to slaves also becomes a mass murderer? Also the fact that her advisors don’t trust her even though she has followed almost every single piece of advice they give her is frustrating to watch. 

Bran. Spends 7+ seasons saying he will be pivotal in the battle against the WW then subverts our expectations when he barely does anything and its deus ex Arya who naruto jumps from the sky to save the day at the last moment. zzZZzz wtf was the setup for? 

They wasted our time foreshadowing and laying the groundwork for plot delivery only to “cleverly” subvert our expectations. 

What incredibly cheap tactics for “shock value”.",There is no way in Westeros he believes that,"Yeah but it was just a blunt statement, there was no justification.  


Seems like it's meant more to be provocative than contributory.  


Plus people in fandom are used to this defiance phenomenon where people take the underdog position for its own sake.",I agree it feels rushed but the character focus for me is the good thing and the fact that Jon has had a major story ark in these past few seasons,Upvoted because I appreciate the positivity,">I’d argue their not exploring characters either. They’re telling instead of showing. We didn’t even get to see the stark sisters reaction to Jons secret.

Perhaps we're looking in different places for characterization. For example, episode 2 was almost entirely an examination of how each character would act, if they believed they were spending their final moments among the living. Only the tiniest bits of story got squeezed in among the character study.

At first I was surprised  they didn't show the Stark sisters' reaction, but then i realized there was no good way to do it. You are correct that what they did was slightly frustrating. They could either just show it, and also show Bran telling the same story we'd already heard (boring!) or just leave at all to our imaginations. Choosing between a boring retell and a frustrating omission, they chose to save a minute in an already oversized episode, and omit. That's a judgement call, and we can disagree on which choice is less-annoying.

The rest of your comments aren't based so much on characterization, but how you'd have liked the story to have been told. They're yours, and you're fully entitled to them, but I can give my outlook on a few, if you'd like.

The Arya angle was set up several seasons ago, as she learned to become an assassin. She was being set up to do a special job, and I predicted here that she'd be the one to off the NK, and right when the battle appeared to be lost. This is because the writers have used one device over and over and over, in resolving swordfights, and in two battles. 

The fight would go from bad to worse for the hero(es), until it looks like all is lost, and then the person/army who you'd been misdirected to forget about, suddenly steps in and saves the day. The did it in Blackwater, in the battle of the Bastards, and in lots of one-on-one swordfights. Arya, the spunky little master assassin was groomed as the one to save the day at the last second by killing the NK, with her little Valyrian Steel dagger: the perfect assassin weapon for any NK who happens to be about...

I guess we could suppose that Sansa liked Littlefinger, but I never saw it that way. When she had to deal with Joffrey, she was an immature child, and Littlefinger was the only one she could (naively) look to as a protector. After marriage to Ramsay Bolton, she grew up fast, and saw Littlefinger as someone who could teach her to read and manipulate people, which could really protect her. I don't think she ever liked Littlefinger, but she now has a lot of him in her.

Tyrion is smart, but he can't read minds, though I suspect he's fooled himself into thinking he could, or at least judge people's motives better than he reasonably could. His string of bad decisions leads to a crisis of confidence, which will play out in his arc. 

The conversation with Varys was particularly interesting. I've seen the plot device used many times in other stories, and the one who advocates rebellion (Varys) tends to chicken out, while the one who adamantly insists on remaining loyal tends to be the one who makes a painful, snap-decision to turn on their leader, in a moment of crisis. I've mentioned this elsewhere here too: it was done beautifully in ""The Caine Mutiny,"" and lots of other places. I strongly suspect that Tyrion will turn on Dany, as the Mad Queen really emerges.

Dany has gone through a long series of successes, tempered with smaller setbacks, until she arrived in Westeros with an unstoppable force. She's had no doubt that she'd win it all. Now, it's starting to fall apart. Her claim to the throne has been shaken. Ep 3 has decimated her armies. Ep 4 has shown that her dragons are not as invincible as she'd assumed. Her faith has been severely shaken, and I expect it to continue in Ep 5. if I'm right, she'll eventually crack.

I agree with you on Bran... his full purpose seemed to be to reassure Jaime, and to render Theon comfortable and happy to die...","You are so right, since arriving in Westeros Daenerys is not the same character. Which would be fine but the writers give us no CONTEXT.... and they have literally pushed the mad queen narrative on us with no motivation or cause whatsoever. I am not a ""dany fanboy"" but its been pretty weird trying to give the show the benefit of the doubt... 

And the military mistakes are another area of contention for me. This show, and the books, are based on the internecine struggles of a global superpower in the late middle ages. These were some of the most advanced military minds, some of the greatest tacticians in history. And yet Daenerys has no guards or lookouts manning the near approach to Dragonstone to warn her in case of an attack?

If it was just one mistake like this then I could excuse it, but its not, its just a series of really stupid tactical errors that no global power could be given the latitude to make, because they would be driven from power if they did.","Could be, could be.","That makes sense... And personally, I don't NOT like the series these past few seasons...","In all that I have read, D&D were the captains of this ship.  If they had added a few extra minutes to an episode or even a few extra episode, they could have.  They made their decisions.  IMO, it's why it is not a good idea for an employee who has served notice to continue working.  The heart is gone, the drive is gone, mentally they have already left the job.  This is an example of that.  They quit before they finished the job...","I'm gonna agree that there's some effort in giving the show the benefit of the doubt, though we may understandably see different reasons for it.

If we look a little closer, I think we may find that there is context for Dany's character, but that it changed well before she came to Westeros; it's just that her changes didn't get shoved in her face until she came to be among a people who didn't give a rip about her. Because Dany had a lot of other stuff goin' on at the time, we may not have paid it a lot of attention.

Dany's come a long way since she could legitimately call herself ""Breaker of Chains."" There was a time when she cared about freeing subjugated peoples, and they loved her for it. The masses crowded behind her, and she's picked up something that to some of us approaches a god-complex.

She's developed into a proud, self-entitled brat, who thinks that a kingdom simply belongs to her, though the people in her ""kingdom"" would beg to differ. The people she's encountered in Westeros don't need their chains broken; they were already free. In fact, as far as they're concerned, this foreign b#$%h has come to put chains on them, by imposing herself on them as a queen they never wanted. She has become to the people of Westeros the exact opposite of what she once was in Essos.

She continually whines that these people don't like her, as she's too naive to understand that she earned the people's admiration in Essos, but is doing everything possible to drive these new folks away.

One of her more pathetic moments was her patting herself on the back for her kind act to Gendry, thinking she actually knew how to deal with these new people. It was an echo of her ""Breaker of Chains"" days, but there aren't that many chains to be broken in this new land. She was dismayed to see her act almost immediately forgotten as so many people expressed their loyalty to Jon, who also doesn't know how to deal with these people, but he naturally came by it, in the same way Dany naturally came by being able to deal with the people of Essos.

Jon and Dany are mirror images, in some ways. Each is a natural leader of crowds of people who are also mirror images of one another. Thing is, Jon is in his element; Dany is a fish out of water.

Dany has no feel for military strategy, so her lack of it needn't surprise us. In some ways, she's as naive as Sansa was, in her pre-Bolton days. (I'd suspect that Sansa recognizes her naivete, and despises her for it...) She's stumbled on the ways to lead one people, her dragons gave her brute-force power when she needed it, and that's sufficed, up \`till now. She's had no idea that she ""lucked-into"" her leadership in Essos.

She has entered a ""Real World,"" where she's not automatically entitled to loyalty. No one cares about her, and even her dragons have suddenly become less important. She's handling it all badly, \`cuz she can't handle Westeros, and hasn't a clue that the problem is with her. So far, there are mere suggestions of ""Mad Queen;"" she's showing an inability to handle things, and people are getting worried.

The fact that people mention ""Mad Queen"" does make one think the writers suggest that she will really crack, rather than simply throw a tantrum, and then grow up. I doubt they'd waste the time to mention it, otherwise. We'll see...",Exactly. How can they be good rulers when they’re this reckless during open war?,"You raise some really good points. I don't have a problem with the mad queen narrative, providing its done properly. My issue with it is that its been such a shallow execution of her story arc. Before season 7 I was right on board with her character. But its like they are only showing us every other frame. Half the story is missing, half the context. Not just with her, but with everyone. The motivations are missing, the moments of reflection and self-awareness, its all wrong. 

I would have preferred the story arc of her and Jon to be more passionate, more shakespearean, but alas that was not to be. What they had/have was very shallow. Which is really sad to me, because they are both anointed with sacred magic, Jon being raised from death, and Daenerys. I understand that the Weiss and Benioff want us to believe that Dany loves Jon, but I don't see it. And I don't know what they wanted us to think about Jon's feelings for her. 

For me, the greatest of all endings to their story arc would have been if they left this plane of existence together, sacrificing themselves for each other, and for Westeros. And moving on together to a new realm, either as night king and queen, or some other place beyond the realm of the living. As things stand now, I cannot see anything other than a very conventional ending to this story. This is what saddens me the most, it was building towards something Wagnerian, something Tolkien, and the wind just kind of collapsed out of the sails. 

<-- all of this is just my little opinion of course, I know people who find the series to be very compelling in its final season.  I respect that.","I know it was intended to be a dramatic, OMG type moment but for me it fell flat because it was so unbelievable. How on earth does Euron's fleet sneak past all the guards or scouts that were stationed along the approach to Dragonstone was the first thing that I thought... Like, it actually confused me because I couldn't see how it was real.",I agree. From high up in the sky they should have seen the fleets well ahead.,"They were attacked by sea, using a new type of weapon that they had no idea even existed. Up \`till that moment, they expected that the dragons were an unstoppable weapon, and they were caught completely unawares. After the attack, we all suddenly realized that the dragons were no longer the big advantage we'd supposed. 

The only surprising thing to me is how incredibly accurate they are for a primitive ballistic weapon, and how something that can hurl a bolt with such force that it can blow right through a ship, has virtually no recoil to it. (Of course, the props that the actor was actually launching from it were probably made of lightweight balsa wood, for safety reasons. Still, their weapons experts could easily  have faked a hefty recoil...)

We may disagree here, but I'm not sure they would have seen a need for guards or scouts. Dragonstone is an island, which has no approach except by sea, and they had freakin' dragons, which Dany would have considered unstoppable. What we'd have considered ""guards"" or ""scouts"" were the ships, which also couldn't stand up to the scorpions. At her moment of feeling her greatest security, Dany learned suddenly that she was intensely vulnerable. Cersei could have built hundreds of those scorpion weapons, while Dany has only one, very vulnerable dragon left.

When Dany came to Westeros, it was with what seemed an unstoppable force behind her. That's all melting away now, and I suspect that it will continue to fade in Ep 5. This, I suspect, will lead to her eventual unraveling.","And the thing is, if they had just stuck a tiny little bit closer to the books, they could have EASILY sold this. Euron in the books has travelled the world, visiting some truly scary places... He is obsessed with magick and surrounds himself with sorcerers, mages and warlocks. In fact, he even owns a Dragonhorn the sole purpose of which is to control dragons. So yea, no pity towards the showrunners, they done fargged up...","Totally agree, we can agree to disagree on these matters of tactics and strategy, that's what makes the show fun.

You make good points, but only partly, I think. The YouTube clip will be helpful in this. If you'll compare it to the scorpion Euron used in ep 4, you may notice that they're not the same weapons at all. The one Bronn used was aimed by hand, and was a little over half the size of Euron's, which needed a team of people to aim it, while Euron simply sat in an attached seat and fired the weapon.

Bronn's weapon was only partially effective. It wounded the dragon, but was destroyed when Dany attacked it. Euron's weapon was lethal to the dragon, and Dany couldn't get close enough to counterattack. Curiously, I think that once Euron fired his bolt and missed was the one chance Dany had to crisp him, before the weapon could be reloaded. She missed her chance. Not sure, though.

Now, even the limited effectiveness of Bronn's weapon should have had everyone wary that the age of using dragons as an unstoppable weapon was about to close. But Dany didn't do it, and from everyone's reaction to ep 4, the audience didn't, either. Qyburn updated his scorpion, and Dany's remaining dragon is all but neutralized, now. Perhaps Dany will die in one final game-of-chicken, in which she and Euron kill one another.

Dany should have recognized from Bronn's weapon that the game had changed radically. Since most of the audience missed that too, perhaps we can't be too hard on her. If all of her dragon experience was that of invincibility, she might become blind to the fact that she was suddenly very vulnerable.

> Any keep or castle, regardless of where it sat, if it was occupied, would be protected and guarded. It doesn't matter if its on the sea or not... To leave it unattended would be to invite exactly this type of disaster. 

I can see where you're coming from, but I'm not sure this would have made any difference. Again, they were attacked by sea, so any attendants, if they were guarding the island, may or may not have been aware that there were extra ships where they shouldn't be. If they did, these people seem to lack any kind of signalling mechanism to alert someone in the air, and even if they could do that, it comes back to the fact that they weren't expecting a dragon-killer weapon. So even if they saw it, that unexpected extra fleet would have been seen as inconsequential: to be investigated and possibly destroyed at their convenience.

The lethal upgraded scorpion changed everything.","I don't buy that this was ""a new type of weapon they had no idea existed""... the similarities between what she faced in S7, and what Euron used against her far outweigh the differences. And in fact, Benioff said it in the BTS interview, ""she just kind of forgot about it..."" LOL

As far as the whole readiness question. The books and show are largely based upon military and intelligence practices that were in use during the late middle ages. What we are talking about here is defense 101. You wouldn't be in power if you didn't have these basic measures in place, because lawlessness and chaos was so prevalent that to leave yourself exposed in that way would mean you'd lost whatever it is you had to protect.

Why they would have chosen to go this route is anyone's guess. I really don't know the answer to that question. But I do know that no amount of arguing that the scene follows any kind of understandable logic is going to convince me. 

There is one argument that makes sense, but unfortunately Benioff and Weiss cannot use it. In the books, Euron is equipped with dark magic, including a dragon horn that is used to control the behavior of dragons. But book Euron is much different than series Euron, so D&D can't use that argument.","All your points are well taken, and there's much there to consider. That said...

>I don't buy that this was ""a new type of weapon they had no idea existed""... the similarities between what she faced in S7, and what Euron used against her far outweigh the differences. And in fact, Benioff said it in the BTS interview, ""she just kind of forgot about it..."" LOL

No prob; I wasn't trying to sell anything. To explain my point, let's start with the fact that Dany is not, and will probably never be, a military tactician. Her successes have been based on inspiring loyalty from the commonfolk, having lots of luck, and having dragons. That's all. She's developed something close to a god-complex, and is absolutely sure she's bound for glorious victories.

I was also amused by Benioff's ""she just kind of forgot about it,"" but I know from experience that an idle answer in an interview can come across as other than you wanted. While it's possible he truly meant that she forgot, I rejected the goofy-interpretation and saw it as Dany's willful-forgetfulness: a denial that she could possibly lose. (I could be wrong...)

And speaking of interpretation, we probably don't need to over-parse what I was saying, either. Dany, again, is not a military tactician, and did not recognize a real threat, because it didn't have real consequences. The V2.0 scorpion was a total game changer, and Dany doesn't seem to have had any idea it was coming or might be coming. Since the audience has, by and large, reacted the same way, I'm not surprised that Dany overlooked the obvious. Many of us did not.

>You wouldn't be in power if you didn't have these basic measures in place, because lawlessness and chaos was so prevalent that to leave yourself exposed in that way would mean you'd lost whatever it is you had to protect. 

This is largely true, but we can't make a law out of it. Dany's power came from luck, admiration, and dragons, period. Dany's troubles come from the fact that she's not as lucky in Westeros, almost no one admires her in Westeros, and they figure out how to kill dragons in Westeros. (And she's lost a huge chunk of her army in an unplanned-for fight.) As a result, your statement is coming true, just a little later than you were expecting. Dany's power is collapsing, and the last two episodes may finally start showing some real story...

> Why they would have chosen to go this route is anyone's guess. 

Since I qualify as an ""anyone,"" I'm guessing that they just want to wrap up the story and do something else. They know we'll watch whatever they put out there, and I'm guessing they're building different episodes to score different types of Emmy awards. (I'm dearly hoping that there's a ""best script"" one still to be shown, but we'll see...)

Appealing in any way to the books is to me a moot argument. This subreddit is ***HBO***GameofThrones; we're discussing the show.

It seems likely the golden company would have young griff/fageon with them at the point where they enter kings landing and Euron has been turned into a teleporting stand up comic. Griff would probably have been easy to get around if there’d been 10 episodes in S7 and 8, Which would also have given Euron more sailing time (and let’s not forget Varys in S7, who popped up everywhere at will himself). It’s a shame, as the set pieces have gradually got more impressive, the story seems to have become less of a priority. The long night said it all for me, at first watch (on my TV), I went with the flow and had my heart in my mouth for the entire episode. What it did well, the impending sense of doom and hopelessness, relentless action and even the lighter interludes, were superb. But surely all that could’ve been achieved with better basics? The battle tactics, or lack of them, were laughable on second watch (the position of the siege weapons and the fact they were all used 2 or 3 times), sending the Dothraki to their death before bombarding the shit out of the horde first? Surely a seasoned survivor of the battle of the bastards (a combination of Ramsey’s tactics and those of the vale would’ve actually been much better, bombardment from distance, shield wall with unsullied, pincer movement with Dothraki, dragon air support once siege weapons stop etc), could’ve done better. The “oh shit!” feeling of the Dothraki flames disappearing could still have happened considering the numbers of whites, but it was ultimately style over substance, just like the last 2 seasons. Now though, my cynic says WoW sales won’t be impacted by the series ending first, and the spin offs (Sorry GRRM), will be making money sooner.",Give us some sources.,Looks fake,"Shouldn’t have given them the rights to do it then.

Sometimes you think he’s gotten too comfortable for his own (and the fans) good.","Agreed, and I'm sure being thrown into the limelight has put a damper on writing.","Seriously!! I kept saying these exact things after The Long Night. I'm starting the books in hopes to fill some of the gaps (knowing it might be a while or never to get to the end) but it just seems like a big tease to show a snippet of the children of the forest, and all the rest you mentioned, really... I guess we'll see how it gets wrapped up in the show (or not).","From what I've read, unless he gets some help, it probably won't happen. He's getting on in years. His last novel in the series was written in 2011, he has two more to go. Since then he's done a small amount of writing, though nothing on the scale of his novels. I would imagine there exist enough writers out there with the knowledge and skill needed to help him implement his overall vision. But it would take him handing over a small amount of control, and after what he's gone through, that may be difficult. He's been gracious about the whole thing, perhaps to a fault. From what I've heard, HBO insisted at a point, on making the series about characters, and less about the plot arc. They did this because characters bring ratings, once the basic story has gelled with viewers. The plot becomes secondary when compared to the popularity of characters. Having been directly exposed to this might have turned him off from the overall process enough that he told himself to stop writing, on some level. Because he stopped writing right around the time the series became massively popular. This is just all my opinion.",He should have just had Stephen King ghostwriter the last 2 books.,[https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/1123230/Game-of-Thrones-George-RR-Martin-HBO-ending-books-change-differences-Iron-Throne-die](https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/1123230/Game-of-Thrones-George-RR-Martin-HBO-ending-books-change-differences-Iron-Throne-die),[https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/1123230/Game-of-Thrones-George-RR-Martin-HBO-ending-books-change-differences-Iron-Throne-die](https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/1123230/Game-of-Thrones-George-RR-Martin-HBO-ending-books-change-differences-Iron-Throne-die),"Nope, it’s true","George = Ned

Book Readers = Catelyn",Yup!  I'm frustrated that he's putting out all these other books and not finishing up this series!  I'm going to have to reread all the other books to remember the written stories versus the HBO version...but I really want him to finish up.,"I have to admit I've given up hope that the show will bring us explanations for these. There are only two episodes left - even if they maybe answer one or two of the open ends, I highly doubt they will answer all of them. There is just not enough time left. After epsiode 3 when Bran did nothing but warg away the whole time and the NK dead now, I thought we'd at least get some explanations for the children, symbolism, and overall all those questions regarding the WW and NK in the next episode. Then episode 4 aired and it was as if the WW/NK menace had never really existed. It could have been every other regular big human army, it did not matter at all that they fought death itself, a powerful magic being with an undead army. Nothing was said or otherwise acknowledged that this was kinda a different thing than usual. I thought it must have meant something that Bran was warged away the whole time, but so far, it did not look like it meant anything. It was just like we saw it - he warged into the crows to watch the NK, and that's it. No bigger meaning behind it. No mystery. 

We're just used so much to see mystery in everything, to make up elaborate theories and to think about every look someone gives, every raised eyebrow, every word someone says that this felt as if it was the prelude to some big reveal. At this point though, although I hope with all my heart that some reveals are still to come or even some shocking twists, I am too disappointed to really believe in it anymore. Next episode will be another battle one with the battle for KL, some main characters will die, though probably less than we thought, last episode will be Cleganebowl and whoever killing Cersei, probably one of Jon/Dany dying and the other one ending up on the throne, bam, over.",Thx bro i'll read it later,Looks like a bunch of different quotes put together with no sources lol,"That's lady bro, thankyouverymuch.","Here is a collection of additional works that I love. These are all from the graphic novel series *Tales of Dunk and Egg,*based on the fantasy novellas by George R. R. Martin, set in the world of his A Song of Ice and Fire novels.

Better safe than sorry.","Had Daenerys arrived to westroes just one season earlier, we could have had much more polished episodes. Instead now we're left with confusing story lines, lack of reactions (Daenery's reaction to her Dragons dying, Arya/Sansa reaction to Aegon/Jon, and etc...) and overall rushed sloopy episodes.","The NK had marked Bran, the mark on his wrist. Bran knew that the NK would be after him because of his 'power'. Setting up the Bait for the NK to be killed by Arya, as per Bran's vision, something he couldn't speak of as it would've influenced the outcome.","Interesting theory. So the question then is, with the NK out of the way, how is Bran changed? Has he taken on additional powers? Has some of the Night King's anger seeped into Bran, infecting him? Or is it just business as usual?","Agree 100%. That’s what’s frustrating about the NK story line. Don’t feel like there was a payoff for it at all, and it just took hours of story away from what could have been incredibly compelling episodes.","At this point I don’t know whether to continue watching the rest of the season, come on guys we’ve waited this long for them to put in minor errors, and for Jon not to pet Ghost, or for Rhaegal to be killed off by an offbrand pirate that doesn’t even have a patch.

Don't @ me",3 is best of worst??,Best,Bummer that all these terrifying scenes lead to a quick defeat,Still the best show though,Not anymore,I agree. This season especially. It's just gone downhill.,"That’s what I’m saying despite (what we have seen so far) this show still holds as the best show of all time, BB has season 1, The Wire has S3, the Sopranos has the last season, Lost has the final episode, The office has s9

All those shows have their weak season but a show is as good as its average best seasons","Yup. On an average, it's a great show. In fact, even on its worst day, the show will still kick some serious network ass. It's just that in comparison to itself, it pales this year.

Maybe that's not fair. But it's the truth!","You are not alone.  Just killing them wouldn't be satisfying enough for her.  She wants them to suffer.  And she wants everyone in the seven kingdoms to hate Dany, and she's willing to sacrifice her subjects to accomplish that.","I don't think what Cersei did had much at all to do with her character. That confrontation was not a battle, but a parley, which in the protocol of warfare is done on a field of truce. Both sides send representatives to meet in the middle, with the understanding that no treachery will happen.

That doesn't mean it can't, but you only get one chance at it, so you'd better make it really good. If you show you will not honor the terms of a temporary truce, it means that the other side won't negotiate with you if things later go badly for you and you want to surrender. That means, even if you're on the ropes and try to surrender, the other side will likely just keep pounding you until everyone on your side is dead.

That's a big chance to take, and it's why in real life, even the most treacherous of commanders don't break the terms of a truce. I suspect Cersei is smart enough to know this, too.

When Tyrion left the parley and walked up to Cersei, she had the scorpion operators ready to fire at Tyrion, on her command. She was messing with Tyrion, but she wanted him to sweat, and think that maybe he'd fear she'd break the truce, and maybe shrink back. Tyrion didn't, so she signaled the scorpion operators to stand down. It was a little cruelty game, and that part was totally consistent with Cersei.

Since Missandei was not part of the parley, Cersei took advantage of the technicality to do a little psychological warfare. Missandei was the only opponent that Cersei could kill, and not break the truce. So she did it to mess with Daenerys, too.","You raise a great point, and I cannot argue against it. It makes me realize that Weiss & Benioff have drawn on a small handful of questionable plot devices. This has led to a a level of skepticism towards many of their legitimate decisions. 

For example, there is a reasonable explanation for Euron being able to sneak up from the ground and attack Rhaegal with arrows. In the book series at least (I have not read them so I speak from research, not direct knowledge) Euron is known to possess magical powers and have at his disposal the magic of wizards and warlocks... (""*Crow's Eye brought back monsters from the east ... aye, and* [*wizards*](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warlocks) *too* "") However, the issue is that in the series, the magic of Euron is not descriptively narrated, so at best it can be implied. Which again brings back the question on the minds of many a fan, why do we not have a slightly more rigorous set of motivations being shown for our characters? As it is, there is so much inference required, that fans have grown frustrated.","No, I think you are absolutely correct.  In Cersei's position it's almost too easy to just kill people.  She can have people executed with a wave of her hand.  She likes to watch them suffer.  

And, i think she probably assumed Missandei was Tyrion's latest girlfriend and her death would hurt Tyrion more than anyone.",He wanted to know what had happened with Bran since he last saw him.  That was actually made pretty clear.,It was obviously done to make clear that Tyrion knows Bran's full story now,I don't think Tyrion's laughter at the idea of them surviving had anything to do with his conversation with Bran.  I think the original comment was an obvious joke considering the odds they were facing and he just laughed at it.,"I'm hoping Bran revealed to him that he's actually a Targ in that time frame.  I know.  Super unlikely but it's been my pet theory, besides my favorite one handed man being the Volanquar.","Surely there was more to that conversation that general meet and greet. 

I mean, we have one of the most analytical minds in westeros and a ""walking""/talking google there. Surely they discussed some deeper things...","Yes.. and I have a feeling that story is going to play some major part in the final episode, after all them kings and queens be done poking each other dead.","Maybe.  Or, maybe he just wanted to hear an interesting story to pass the time while they waited for the dead to arrive.  We don't need to see that bc we already know it all. Surely he did get some good insight regarding how things had come to that point, but Bran doesn't even tell his own family most of the things he knows, so why would he tell Tyrion?","Bran is truly a cipher at this point. Getting any useful information from him is going to be a tiring endeavor at best, and a yieldless one at worst.",Without hesitation. YES,"Yes, by far. Season 5 gave us Hardhome. Dorne is really the only problem with season 5 and that is minuscule compared to the scale of problems we have now",Not even a question.

The ""monster"" she has blamed for her mother's death her entire life and hand to the ""usurper"" queen, she has a chance to take out but doesn't, instead only kill the assistant/translator to goad Dany.

Like how did she know Dany was going to Dragonstone? How did Euron know to be standing there on his (amazingly steady and not bobbing on the water) ship with his giant crossbow thing poised at the ready so he would see the dragons before they saw him? How did they know Missandei was important to Dany? (We won’t get into why they only plucked one person from the sea after the attack and it happened to be one of Dany’s closest advisors.)  I’m hoping it’s that someone is spying vs just more bad writing. 

I don’t think they mentioned Dragonstone to Bronn after almost getting killed. I think Varys is a prime suspect.

(Edits - typos)","It's a possibility. But I don't recall the show using a lot of flashbacks to tell the story.. Usually the surprises that are revealed are forward playing, not explaining stuff that happened in the past..","I've been giving this some more thought. It's actually a really really fascinating idea. If you ask me, it can only boil down to one or two individuals: our so-called advisers. As you mention, Varys is prime. While a man of somewhat shaky allegiances, he is also very much WYSIWYG. He has illustrated this on several occasions throughout the series. Varys is not really the scheming type. This leaves Tyrion, who has shown again, and again that he is. This trait, combined with the fact that he is deeply connected to Cersei, well... I suppose the only additional question to ask would be, is he also a raven-maester...","I think Dany started unraveling long before that. I also thought Missandei's comment in the crypts was unnecessary (long live Miss Sunday!) Sansa wasn't being a bitch about it to Tyrion, she was stating the facts that Tyrion is on the side of Dany and Sansa wants to keep the north independent. She doesn't know anything of Dany's story and sure, she helped with the dragons, etc... but that doesn't mean she wants to give up the independence of Winterfell. She's also protective of Jon. 

Sansa *did* learn a lot from those villainous characters. That doesn't make her wrong. Case in point: when she's talking to the Hound about not having gone with him because it made her who she is. They were shitty/horrible things but she finds that gratitude in that darkness. I respect that. Her gut is telling her not to trust Dany. We see that very clearly when Dany grants Gendry his lordship. It's pure manipulation.

I feel bad for Dany, too. She's alone, for the most part. She's conditioned to think the throne is hers, but is it, really? Not just because of Jon (is he really an heir to the throne, either?!) The Targs took the throne... then lost it. It's not theirs just because they sat on it for many years. I also don't have enough knowledge to articulate that, but it's out there. She doesn't truly have a home. She was surrounded by all these northerners who have history and bonds, etc...Fuck, I'd lose it, too! 

I think she started unraveling when the slaves held her high and called her Mhysa and then she chopped off that dude's head who thought he was helping her.

No one is right or wrong... but there are definitely consequences, and her hunger for power is blinding.",Villainous?  Petyr Baelish?

It’s L-A-D-D-E-R.,Littlefinger was NOT villainous....I miss that fucker!,"I don’t think it was an unnecessary comment. And Sansa gave a look to Tyrion that it was a bitchy comment. Sansa was a bitch to Daenerys since she arrived. They would have been killed if Daenerys didn’t use her own army that she got all by herself. That was her army that was mostly massacred. She did it because it was right and even if Sansa wants the North to be independent doesn’t mean she gets to be a bitch and go against Jon’s word to Daenerys. Cuz really he was named King of the North and he bent the knee to save the North and all mankind really. Sansa has always been jealous that he would be warden and then they also named him King of the North, because she has always wanted to rule. She’s not just being protective of Jon she is really protecting her rule. She doesn’t want to lose her power she has gotten. She craves it now. 

Yes she learned a lot but she is using the same tricks she despised about them. Her gut feeling is that there is another women trying to impose on her power she has over the North. Not saying she doesn’t care about Jon or the North but she wants the power. That’s why she didn’t keep Jon’s secret. She knew that it would spread. She took time to see how it would benefit herself like Little finger and Cersei would have done and then blabbed. She is becoming like those in the capital her family never wanted to be like. And for what Daenerys did for Gendry, sure it may have been manipulative to an extent, but really it was a strategical. That’s what you do when giving out titles as a Queen or King. You want allies.

I mean really the Throne is up for grabs, I guess, but from how it works in the GoT world it is hers and she wants to take it back. I mean she started out wanting it for the right reason, but her journey and especially recently has been pretty messed up. I mean I can understand why she’s losing it but now is the time she has the choice to have it affect her so negatively that she becomes the Mad Queen or not. Which she prob will go full Targaryen or if not will end up dying. But Sansa didn’t know any of that. Now the fact Arya said something to Jon is what I feel would make it have an impact to at least look at things more weary like for Jon. Arya only ever cared about her family and her and Jon had a deep bond. Sansa always wanted to be a lady and rule. I mean she is great at it, not saying she isn’t, but I also think that’s were her mind is on, just like Daenerys and just like Little Finger and Cersei. She craves the power and isn’t going to let it go. 

In my opinion she is still that selfish girl she always was, but has just learned to be “hard” and not trust anyone. Which is understandable from what she has been through but it doesn’t mean she hasn’t become more like those who made her that way.","I imagine perhaps you are saying this (hopefully) somewhat ""tongue in cheek"".. That said, its good to remember that not everyone here speaks English as their first language. Many are making really great contributions and moving the conversation forward in meaningful ways.

I do wish he didn't die/get killed off so quickly, though.","Hmmm... as I see it, If I'm talking to someone and they stick up for Littlefinger, I imagine i have two choices. I can back away slowly...

...or run away ***quickly***.   ;-)","I see where you're coming from but I have to disagree and stand with how I see it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6b\_K1DTYFQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6b_K1DTYFQ) (I suppose I could find a better copy, but laziness took over!) :) She was being realistic in this scene, not spiteful. Granted, she *just* had that awkward conversation with Dany where they were somewhat chummy until Sansa mentioned the independence in the north and Dany immediately withdrew her hand and scowled before getting interrupted (by Theon's arrival, and then witnessing their loyalty to each other). Missandei was just being protective of Dany, it just seemed like the comment was snarky. They were talking about being married and how it wouldn't work. Every time I watch it I think, ""eh, why did she need to butt in? Not your conversation, girlfriend."" 

Yes, she was definitely being strategical about naming Gendry. Because he's a *Baratheon.* This is the house that took the throne from the Targs. Of course she's being manipulative. Not to an extent. Completely. 

I think that selfishness has softened greatly. She's not that same girl in Kings Landing who begged to stay so she could be the queen with Joffrey. She played the part to survive while there after Ned got killed. She also hardened, for sure! Rape and constant manipulation will do that. I honestly don't think she wants the power like Dany wants the power. It's just not black and white. No one is perfect, or all good. 

I guess I'm team Sansa more than team Dany. It's not going to end well for Dany. 

It likely won't end well for anyone.","Ultimate manipulator. Between him and Jaime, I mean, without those two we don't really have a GOT story. They are the ones who kicked everything off.. Stirred the hornet's nest so to speak.",He made it all the way through season 7 that was not being killed off quickly! Lol. He was deff villainous! Sooo manipulative and getting so many good people killed just to try and get himself up the ladder.,"Yes, but she added that his loyalties would be divided which was unnecessary in my opinion. He understood after she said Dragon Queen as it’s no secret Sansa doesn’t like her. But she added that just to make it more bitchy comment towards Daenerys and Missandri was right to stick up for the women who literally is saving them all down in that crypt. It’s what bitchy girls do, and that’s how Sansa has always been, bitchy. 

Yes she wants to keep an eye on Gendry as well, who wouldn’t. I don’t think it was manipulation really. Or it was really bad manipulation as any one could see why she gave him the title. One he did totally earn it, but two she wants allies and she wants to make sure she has eyes on him for being the bastard son of the usurper. Which is strategical as well. 

I really don’t think her selfishness has softened. I see a jealous girl who wants to rule the North and is doing what she can to keep that power and using all the things she learned by those she despised, all their manipulative tricks. Yes she had to play a part to keep herself alive but that doesn’t mean she lost her selfish ways. Yes I understand why she has hardened, it’s totally understandable, but that doesn’t make what I feel she is like any less true. 

No one is perfect for sure, but Daenerys sacrificed A LOT to fight the army of the dead and it also allowed Cersei to get stronger. She could have left them all to die, took back the Throne and then fought the dead when the came, but she chose to fight alongside Jon and the North. Daenerys has made some mistakes sure, but ultimately has done what she thought would be good for the people she was going to rule, except for now she is starting to go a little crazy. But up till now she has been mostly selfless in trying to do what is right. Oh totally not going to end well for Daenerys, but that doesn’t make me like Sansa. Haha.

I’ve never really liked Sansa because of her selfishness and still don’t cuz it’s still there. I thinks she is a strong character, especially for all she has been through, but all the characters have been through shitty times, just in a different way. She’s a great character just as Cersei is. But that doesn’t mean I like their personalities haha. 

Oh and totally not trying to change your mind. I love discussions like this. :)",Haha me too. As long as we can agree to disagree. :),"Honestly hate dragon queen after she got 1v1d by the night king on a dragon. But this argument really made me reconsider liking her more. Good points.

Arya, based on her S1 experience, moves towards the same tunnels with the Hound. The path is too small for bigger characters so Tyrion and Arya push forward to confront Cersei. Arya is stopped and confronted by Syrio, who reveals himself to be Jagan Hagar, and stops Arya short of terminating Cersei. Tyrion confronts his sister once more and Cersei leaves him in Euron's hands. Jaime walks in on this shit storm and duels Euron. Cleagane bowl begins. Sandor, no longer afraid of fire, burns Qyburn and the Mountain to death. Dany looses patience and attacks Kings Landing before seeing ""the signal"". A bunch of pig shit explodes and the peasants riot on Cersei's forces. Jon walks through the burning green pigshit and exclaims, ""I'm fuckin Aegon, bend the knee!"" The golden company obliges. While the dragon dances and peasants riot, the golden company says fuck it and breaks their contract and follow Jon's lead to the red keep. Dany feels like she won but the red keep is fucked.

The Night King has been built up as the ultimate enemy over the past 7 seasons. Almost everyone expected the battle against the dead to be the final battle and the entire realm of man to unite for the same. However, this would not work, because NK is a temporary threat and people essentially SET ASIDE their differences to deal with it, they haven't resolved their differences. So once the living survived the dead, all those differences would eventually resurface and you would still have the final battle of people vs people. I believe the show runners have thought of this and wish to have these political differences resolved (one way or another) within the purview of the show, so that the realm is all the better for it. This is the only way to fulfill the prophecy of Azhor Ahai, rid the world of darkness and bring light- the darkness didn't just come from the NK and the army of the dead- darkness existed within the realm of the living itself, with houses fighting bloody wars for power, no matter the cost to the realm. This is the darkness that must be vanquished. 
I feel the only way forward, for the show, is to fulfill this prophecy and have Jon Snow become Azhor Ahai after killing Daenerys.","Euron is far too crazy & uncontrollable to simply be Cersei's lap dog. It was an act (and did happen to get him laid, so it had its purpose...) Euron's negotiations to secure the Golden Horde has them ultimately answering to him, not Cersei. True to the nature of the Ironborn, Euron will ultimately make a grab for power. This may be where Cersei meets her demise. There are other possibilities...

The vast number of Qyburn's scorpions stationed around King's Landing render the remaining dragon extremely vulnerable... when it can be seen and aimed at. Short hit-and-run night attacks may become the strategy, wherein there's never a visible burst of flame that lasts long enough for the scorpion operators to take aim.

The Hound will be beaten by The Mountain. Greyworm will take on The Mountain in battle, and while Greyworm will be killed, he'll take The Mountain out as he dies.

The comment, back at Winterfell about the dragons not eating was a pointless waste, unless something was going on. Perhaps, somewhere up north, are a couple of nests containing dragon eggs.

Since Arya is headed south, she has some more assassin work to do. This time, she'll use someone else's face to get close to her target. (That skill was so far only used for the plotwise-minor act of killing a minor character for revenge.) A major character will also meet their demise. (Cersei, using Qyburn's face? It would help scratch a name from her list)

The comments about Daenerys' instability are worthless to the story, unless something's going on there. She's gonna lose it. It may become serious enough that she has to be killed, perhaps after she screams the familiar line, ""Burn them all..."" She, not Cersei, also might be the one that Arya eliminates.

Or... perhaps Mad-Queen Daenerys plays the ultimate game of chicken against Euron, and she crisps him as he fires the shot that ends with her crashing to her death. Since Daenerys has spent almost the whole story struggling to gain the throne, she's not likely to get it (too predictable) so i expect her to die, somewhere.

Ever-brooding Jon Snow will refuse the throne, and go back north. As he'd be the last Targaryan, maybe he'd become the ""Father of Dragons"" to those dragon eggs, if they're up there...

GRRM has said that much of his story borrows from The Wars of the Roses (Lancaster vs. York, instead of Lannister vs. Stark). As the real conflict ended, a marriage that included the bloodlines of Lancaster and York were joined in house Tudor, its symbol being a rose with both red and white petals, combining the red and white roses that symbolized Lancaster and York. Tyrion and Sansa will reunite in a new house, whose sigil contains a lion and a wolf.","Few thoughts/ideas... 


Jaime is going back to kill Cersei. I don’t think he will be the one to do so but he will definitely try. Though he had been despicable in the past, when his reasonings have been explained, he doesn’t seem so terrible. So yeah it was shitty for him to say that to her but perhaps the part of him being hateful like Cersei, just means that he has hate towards her. 


I think Cersei being pregnant is going to be part of her demise. It’s not Euron’d baby, I thought it was supposed to be Jaime’s so my thought was that Euron in a fit of rage will go back on his deal with Cersei. Also, wasn’t Cersei supposed to only have 3 children?


Regarding green eyes... well both Cersei and Daenerys have green eyes, something that the camera seems to continuously show in episode 4. 

Another thought is why would the wildlings go back north instead of trying to support Jon’s cause? I mean he only has a few people left so I almost feel like he has to come back. I also don’t know if Bryanne and Sansa will stay back. I think they need to be more part of the action or what would their role be staying back? 

And of course the Hound should fucking destroy the Mountain, fire the most ideal way as it would be the Hound coming full circle.. though I agree I don’t see him surviving the show. 

I’m also curious, if the next episode is the big battle, given the director,  then what will happen in the following episode?

I am bought into this theory. I heard someone else mention that with the foreshadowing of earlier seasons, it will be either him pushing her out a window, or him sacrificing himself and both of them flying out a window.

I've seen worse this week...","I suppose that there wouldn't be a reason for Jaime to go back to Kings Landing if he truly changed and followed the redemption arc that we'd like to see.

OTOH, if that change was fragile, easily disturbed, and he had some sort of sick addiction to Cersei that he'd never completely gotten over, he might just have a relapse. In that case, he gave up his hard-won gains, and went back to being the person he was.

I hope there's more to it than that, or that he's still conflicted and comes back.

But since this story seems to do the very worst things to all its characters, we might just see some contrivance that forces Sansa to go down to King's Landing. Then Brienne would follow.

It would be quite the gut-wrenching conflict if Brienne then came face to face with Jaime, from opposite sides of a battle line...",Jaime and Tyrion are both codependent damaged goods. Would you date either?,"> Jamie leaving Brienne makes no sense to the plot...

Hmm... I'm going to disagree here. I mean, who knows with the plot. We're at the beginning of this particular plot thread so we can't tell sense until it plays out. But does it make sense as a character choice? Hell yeah. And in a couple of different ways.

1) *Surface Read*: Jamie has always been tied to Cersei. She's like an addiction for him. Every choice he's ever made in his life has been shaped by Cersei. He knows she is in very real danger of dying. He thinks she is pregnant with their child. She's a monster, yes. But she's *his* monster and he'll be by her side, protecting her, even if it kills him. 

2) *Deeper Read*: Cersei is a monster but so is Jamie. Yes, she shaped all of his life-choices but he let that happen. He allowed himself, for a brief while, to pretend with Brienne that he really was the good and decent man she saw him as. But his past actions hold too much weight. He cannot hide from them. So he's heading down to King's Landing to make sure Cersei does lose, does die, and to die by her side as he deserves.

As examples go, it doesn't get any worse. Nothing was more important to Ned than to hide Jon's identity. It's an enormous part of the whole series. He lied to his WIFE, and the lie broke both their hearts. The only thing you could use with Jon is pointing to what Bran said about him. Otherwise it's utterly arbitrary on Ned's part.",And gendry was literally born AND raised in kings landing. You’re just defending piss poor writing,he would then be better off not taking a surname if he did not want attention drawn to him.,"So much for all this defense. D&D are moron story tellers. Developed the greatest masterpiece when adapting material, but they were futile in developing their own coherent narrative. This show has sucked since season 7.","Wow, the D&D dick sucking is certainly real, with this OP","No Catelyn knew that Jon came from the south. It’s literally said in like the first or second episode and in the books. Ned went south for the war, and came back to the North with a “bastard.”",You need to understand that Gendry was NEVER recognized as being a bastard by Robert. Robert never gave him a bastard surname. I said it in the post  do I have to spell it out for you? It’s just a theory don’t get angry over it.,Then that’s where option 2 comes in as I said in the post.,You clearly didn’t see any of the points i made. The episodes i named are original and not from the books. Same with casting.,Lmao a little late maybe next time kid,"Fathers don't give, or decide not to give, their bastards their surnames. They just come with the territory, literally. Proof of that is Bran saying Jon's not a Sand. Prior to finding out about the wedding, Bran said he was a Sand because the Tower of Joy is in Dorne. And Jon was there for like, one day, or however long it took for Ned and Howland to bury the dead. So the ""where they're raised"" idea is for the trash as well. Sorry, but it's nowhere near a ""good enough explanation"", because it's not good enough. It's not even a little bit good.","How am I angry? Lol

It just makes no sense and they made a mistake. The writing has been awful. This particular mistake doesn’t detract from the story but it’s an example of how bad D&D has been","it doesn't make much sense considering rivers is a bastard name. if he really wanted to set himself apart as a man he world have picked something else and not a bastard name. that's bad writing, don't make excuses for it.","You're clearly implying that I thought those were good episodes. Granted Hardhome was, but everything that followed was mediocre. I don't understand why the Winds of Winter get so much praise. 

D&D devolved from masterful story telling to shock and awe. I think they got lost in all the praise they received.","I’m saying that by Bran saying Jon is a Sand is incorrect, because the surname corresponds with where they are raised, not where they were born. Also bastards aren’t given surnames if they are not recognized by the noble parent because otherwise it doesn’t matter.",Ik and that’s why this theory does no harm,"Ok but i said that maybe he gave himself the name Rivers because he feels that his defining moments of becoming a man took place in the Riverlands so ge feels that his family(Arya and Hotpie, Yoren etc) raised him there.",Ok then there is no argument about any of this because anything is just pure opinion.,"again, makes zero sense. this means if that happened in the north he would have gone for snow. defining moment he became a man, and that's without the guidance or help of a father so why be his bastard? he became his own man.","It doesn’t necessarily mean that he told everyone he ran into that that was his name. It could be that that’s what he thought of himself. When he tells Arya in the show the point is that he is no longer a bastard but a Baratheon (which he accepts gladly, implying that he did not hold his father in a particularly bad light). So his way of using the surname Rivers is just a different way of telling her that he isn’t a bastard anymore. It could also be a subtle nod that he had accepted himself as a bastard of Robert Baratheon and chose to give himself the name Rivers in tribute to all Arya has done for him","To be honest this is probably the sloppiest bit of writing in the entire series. It's absolutely negligent. It happens AT THE STRONGHOLD of Daenerys, literally on her front doorstep. In no reality would a raider be allowed to ambush his enemy in this way. There is no way this can be justified or explained away. It means that literally there were no guards, no watchmen at the cliffs, and that Rhaegar and Drogon were effectively blinded. I don't buy it for one second...","100% died like this just to Chekhov's Gun the giant crossbow. Ridiculous...

Have him die in the battle of Winterfell or at the start of the battle of Kings Landing, not this half hearted shambles with almost no time to comprehend. 

Euron is just the worst plot device ever, that's what he is, he's not a character","I'm not saying I like the writing for this season. So far it's the weakest of all ( and don't forget... we've had to endure Dorne...)

That said, the death of Rhaegal, just out of the blue, slaps us in the face with the fact that Daenerys' dragons aren't the ultimate weapon that we'd expected they'd be. She sailed from Essos with what appeared to be an unstoppable advantage, and now it's all just melting away. (That's a plot device called tension...)

They were easily caught by surprise, cuz they had no idea that there could be a weapon that would bring down a dragon. Yes, the NK did it, but that could have been dismissed as a supernatural threat that has been eliminated. But since Qyburn's scorpions have a longer range than a dragon's fire has, the dragons are effectively neutralized, except in situations where they can't be seen, like fog, or nighttime.

The sudden death shows just how small an advantage a dragon has become. Their world has changed.

Of course, compared to the ancient Roman weapon that GoT's design is copied from, Qyburn's scorpions are almost as magical as the dragons are. The idea that a single man can cock the weapon for another shot, and that a quick pull can put in enough energy to smash the projectile straight through a ship, rather than at best just sticking in the hull, is a huge stretch. Even more magically, the weapon doesn't even have any recoil. (I'm guessing that for safety's sake, the props they're firing are made out of balsa wood.) The Roman weapon was truly powerful, but it took a team of men to cock it for reuse, and it also took some time.","It is a deliberate hint. Jon is like Starbuck, aka Kara Thrace, come back from the dead to save everyone, destined to fade away once the job is done.","Is this the full extent of the reasons why people think this was the worst episode ever?

Y’all be forgetting she fought Jon’s war when she could’ve sat that one out and still have her whole army and both her dragons if she just stayed in Dragonstone or Essos. Since season 1-6 George has been giving her so much character development just for D&D to make her so two-dimensional and predictable with the whole mad queen plot. 

How is she so mad? She showed her enemies mercy. The Tarly’s has every chance to bend the knee and save themselves, but nope, they didn’t, and that isn’t Dany’s fault. 

She had every chance to SACK King’s Landing when she had all her allies, when compared to Cersei who was at her weakest. But nope, she followed TYRION’s dumbass advice and ended up falling into a trap because they didn’t want “innocent people dying”, which is practically  inevitable and unavoidable in this situation. 

War is war.

Yet despite EVERYTHING y’all still think Jon should be the rightful king? Lmao.

The man who runs STRAIGHT into battle without giving a second thought yet miraculously survives every time because of divine intervention. 

The man who literally is so naive to think that people will mirror the same honor he so shows them, which BTW got him killed in the first place.

Please, don’t lecture me about “that’s his blood right”  because honestly he hasn’t gone through what Dany has gone through.

I'm going to take a back seat on this whole Mad Queen theory. In two weeks we'll probably know for sure.

For all we know, Cersei might actually be the Mad Queen, which would make sense of she has a lot of Qyburns mighty fine chemicals in some basement, I mean, it wouldn't be a first for her to try to ""Burn them all!"". Also, to add, I don't think I could blame Cersei either, to be honest. She's the evil, vile tyrant that Dany wants to eliminate, but in retrospect, my armchair psychology could probably find a reason for that as well..","Exactly what I feel!
Dany has been “working” to become queen for years while having a really shitty life, and then comes Jon Snow that DOESN’T even want to be king, and just because he’s a man and someone’s son and because he’s such a Mary Sue, everyone starts hating on Dany and wishing Jon’s becomes the king.

Everyone’s calling Daenerys a bitch, but honestly, if you work for something your entire life and start to see someone trying to take it away, so easily even, you would probably be a worse bitch that Dany and we can’t expect every character to not have normal emotions like jealousy.","But I also don’t think that someone that doesn’t want to be king should be one.

In which case I was more directed towards Sansa managing to somehow let Cersi know lol",Yes but he's more like his father- Ragar and he would never burn anyone alive as proof when Craster  was being burnt by melissandra he gave him a more merciful death so there a massive difference but I want another twist like Ayra killing the night king,oooooooooooooooooooooooo,"Tyrion isn’t everyone... but that’s exactly everyone’s thoughts before spreading a secret.

Massive difference between what? All the talk of Daenerys being mad but all she has done is listen to her advisors.

That's pretty selfish to me. It wasn't her place to do that and a true Stark makes a promise and keeps that promise. I'm sure there were plenty of times it would have been in Ned's favor to tell a secret he swore to keep too but did he? That's the difference in a good strong character and a weak selfish one. She acts like she's grown so much but really she's became just as toxic as the people she claims to hate. I've never liked Sansa and I definitely don't now,"Lets ignore everything before she got away from Ramsay because maybe you'll agree she's been petty and awful until that ""growth opportunity""

She was incredibly **dumb** in battle of the bastards. She and Jon went to all the Northern lords to amass an army. Jon realized that they had all the men they were going to have and Sansa wanted to wait until they had more men. At no point did she tell Jon or any of the generals about her relationship with the Vale - even after she called on them for reinforcements. They could have waited for the Vale to arrive or at least planned a battle strategy around the reinforcements. Sansa's silence essentially caused tons of pointless bloodshed including the Giant and possibly even could have saved Rickon. 

She was incredibly **selfish** when Jon went to Dragonstone to get allies for the war against the dead. While he was away, she was sowing doubt among the northerners in Jon's leadership, leading people to believe that _she_ would be the better leader in the north. I agree it's a controversial move for Northerners when their king (Jon) chose to bend the knee to Dany, but it is selfish of Sansa to stoke those flames and breed mistrust of Jon/Dany rather than try to foster consensus while being an advisor to Jon. Even during the battle for winterfell she was in the crypt whining about Dany. And obviously it was selfish of her (and dishonorable and un-stark-like) to not keep her word to Jon by telling his secret.

**Useless** I think is obvious but I'd entertain your suggestion as to what useful thing she's done so far this series. Willing to go back to season 1 here. I could be forgetting something.

In season 1 she was selfish, entitled, and innocent. Now she's only selfish and entitled. It's a kind of character growth I suppose.","With that said she swore her word and went back on it weather it's for the greater good or not, she betrayed the man she wants to make King. Remember why jon told Cersei he bent the knee to Dany, when jon gives his word he keeps it, wich I know is ironically Kingly","Jon swears her to secrecy as to his actual heritage. Not a day later shes like ""Yo Tyrion, soo I've got this secret, Jon actually has a better claim to the throne. Heres why... but don't tell anyone.""","I agree. She is one of my favorite arcs, no matter what people think of her.","I like Jamie's because he's got complex motivations to where I don't think even he knows what he wants. 

Also Dany is probably the character that's come the farthest. Remember how shy she was in season one? Then got ridiculously powerful and now is so close to what she's wanted for so long and all these problems keep popping up and it's driving her insane.","Except she's doing it for the North, not for herself. She lost brothers and her mother in the war for the North to be free; she was held prisoner and tortured. In her eyes, her brother is the heir to everything. He can solve the entire equation. In this world, Targaryens have brought nothing but suffering. Her brother is a good and honorable man. She probably thinks he doesn't want anyone to know because of his blind love for Daenerys. The right decisions are always the hardest ones, in this case, breaking her oath was the cost. She did the right thing, but she will pay. 

And FFS, who else is going to be the one to put the information into motion??? It has to get out there from the mouth of a powerful person and to the most powerful people who could do the most with it, she had to be the one to tell.",">Sansa's silence essentially caused tons of pointless bloodshed including the Giant and possibly even could have saved Rickon.

On this I call bullshit. She wasn't sure if the Vale were going to come or not and those planning the battle weren't primed to listen to her. Which she realized. She specifically told Jon that he had to write off Rickon as dead. She told him Ramsey would mind game him. She previewed for Jon exactly what was going to happen and that he needed to not be reactive. 

Jon was reactive. He took acted in a way that everyone, including himself, knew would doom their men. The bloodshed at Battle of the Bastards was all on Jon. Sansa saved the day.

>While he was away, she was sowing doubt among the northerners in Jon's leadership, leading people to believe that *she* would be the better leader in the north. 

What episode did that happen in? 

>Even during the battle for winterfell she was in the crypt whining about Dany. 

She was being forthright and honest. Telling the queen's top advisor (with another advisor listening in) exactly what she'd already told the queen, to her face: Sansa does not trust that Dany has the North's best interest in mind. That Dany decided to not meet Sansa's honesty with honesty -- use the opportunity offered to learn what it takes to rule Westeros. To learn how to gain the trust and loyalty of a people with very different philosophies than what she's been raised around. That choice was on Dany.

>And obviously it was selfish of her (and dishonorable and un-stark-like) to not keep her word to Jon by telling his secret.

It was very un-Stark-like. I agree. Ned was deeply honorable. Ned is dead. Ditto all the other honorable Starks. Sansa would like to keep her brother alive. She will do what she thinks is needed to bring that about.","And also deeply, deeply stupid. It's exactly that kind of school-yard ""honor"" codes that created the war in the first place and nearly wiped out the Stark family. The Starks are lucky that their two girls have gone out into the world and learned a new way of doing things. The Starks may survive the show yet. Because of them.","She didn't tell him not to tell anyone. She for sure wanted him to tell people. Disloyal as in breaking her promise, sure... but she did it with a purpose, not to be selfish or petty. She (and many others) think that Jon would be a better monarch than Daenerys, and not only that, his claim is more rightful than hers. 

In the end, she'll pay for it somehow.","That's where our opinions differ, I will never believe she did it for the North.. Daenerys saved the North and lost alot in that process. Jon did what he did for the North. But Sansa did what she did because she's selfish and wanted to spread info she had no right to spread for her own gain. Daenerys has nothing to do with her past. She didn't kill Sansa's family. Sansa has no reason to hate Dany but she does, she's threatened by her and is 100% acting in her own self interest. Why else would she pick a fight with her right before the battle of Winterfell. Was it in the Norths best interest to have Dany not there? Do you know something I don't about the numbers and capability of the North? And just a reminder Jon is a Targaryen too so by your logic he isn't fit either if that's all you've got against Daenerys. And I could type forever about the multitude of good Targaryen rulers but that's not the point. Sansa did the wrong thing and I hope like hell she pays for it but I have a feeling it's just going to get Jon killed by Dany. And to your last little blurb noone had to set it in motion. It was Jon's secret he would have let people know as he was ready like he was doing by telling Dany and his sister's but Sansa spent a little too much time with the snakes and has turned into them. We hated Little Finger for this exact behavior and I hate Sansa for it as well.","Battle of the Bastards - why wouldn't she tell Jon that the Vale was at least an option and they should wait to confirm the possibility?

Sansa was sowing doubt in Jon's leadership season 7 episode 3, when serving as regent and the Northerners come to her with questions. One of the lords wonders why she isn't the leader since she's good at it and Jon left. Sansa smiled and allowed the controversy of Jon's going to Dragonstone to fester instead of nipping it in the bud.

And great, she doesn't like Dany. But is the middle of a battle against the dead the best time to start breeding resentment among the people around you? Why does she have to actively and publicly question the decisions of her brother and king? Why is that better than being a loyal advisor that offers private opinions about his decision making ?

I also think it's obvious that revealing Jon's parentage puts him in _more_ danger, not less. It also makes his relationship with his most powerful ally _way_ less stable (I personally predict Jon will die because Sansa revealed his secret).

I also predict that Sansa ends the show on the Throne as Tyrion's wife. (Tyrion is the heir if Cercei dies)","I understand why the characters did what they did, the same way I understand why ned said nothing for 15 years. It took 24 hours for this knowledge to insight treason and the game of thrones activated again.",Yes jon has a better claim. So did maester Ameon yet he refused the throne and allowed a younger sibling to rule and all his family ugh respected his decision. Even if jon doesn't want to be king and they see him as one. They should respect the wishes and the oaths they gave him. All this tell me is if sansa thinks its worth(or believes enough) it she can interfere but all she is doing is causing chaos. Looks little finger wins in the end.,"Yeah but that's the whole purpose of loyalty. If you are loyal to someone, and they entrust something to you that is extremely important to them. You in turn go run and tell someone else who holds a completely different loyalty for the furtherance of your own goals, well you're not loyal anymore. It makes you selfish. She's doing things according to her will because she wants them this way or that. It's the definition of selfish.  In this particular case it's also petty. She knows very little about Dany, Jon tries his best to get her to play nice. As does Tyrion which leads to her telling him, but his original goal there was to get Sansa to be agreeable.","It had to be set in motion. For the plot. Otherwise, what's even the point of his identity? 

And what is Sansa's gain? That makes her so selfish for doing this? If Jon becomes king, what would she gain that's so selfish of her?

And Daenerys had to fight. There really wasn't an option. There's no kingdom to rule if everyone is a zombie. It's not wrong of Sansa to want to know what is going to happen afterwards, for the Northern people, who had unanimously decided they wanted to be free from the crown and had already fought one war over it during this series.

And no, Daenerys didn't do those things to Sansa, but that's not how people think. Sansa was raised with the stories about Targaryen rule, and the Targaryens have always been a hated family of monarchs (even with the few good things the family did, doesn't wipe their 90% horrible history). And now here Daenerys is with dragons and can essentially do whatever she wants - who up North can setup her? And we've seen she isn't much about diplomacy. Which Sansa's also witnessed.

Jon is a man of the North who happens to have a Targaryen claim. Daenerys was raised as a Targaryen. It's weird you would even throw that in there as some kind of valid counter argument.",">Battle of the Bastards - why wouldn't she tell Jon that the Vale was at least an option and they should wait to confirm the possibility?

As I recall Jon wasn't paying her much attention at that point. I think Sansa didn't want to give him information she wasn't 100% sure about since he wasn't listening to her much anyway. 

>One of the lords wonders why she isn't the leader since she's good at it and Jon left. Sansa smiled and allowed the controversy of Jon's going to Dragonstone to fester instead of nipping it in the bud.

That could mean she's looking to usurp Jon. Or (and in my opinion more likely) she's keeping her own mouth shut to better allow others to speak their mind so she has an accurate sense of what the lords are all thinking. 

>But is the middle of a battle against the dead the best time to start breeding resentment among the people around you? 

What breeding of resentment? We get no camera shots of random listeners reacting. She's talking to a very smart man who's not going to be swayed simply because Sansa honestly expresses her current worry regarding Dany's view of the North. (A view Dany is already aware of because Sansa full on told Dany her thinking as well.) 

>I also think it's obvious that revealing Jon's parentage puts him in *more* danger, not less. It also makes his relationship with his most powerful ally *way* less stable... 

And that powerful ally *already* knows this very, very dangerous secret. Sansa trusts Tyrion's judgement. Someone needs to know that Dany may begin to look at Jon as a threat. (Though I also think Sansa isn't thinking solely of Jon's safety. I'm sure she's looking to maneuver Dany off the Iron Throne. Possibly thinking Jon could take that place. Or maybe a few more steps ahead towards the destruction of that kind of centralized power on the whole -- thought that's just me spinning theories at this point.)","I actually do think Ned was wise to keep quiet about Jon. (Breaking his code by living a lie for so long.) Where he went stupid was deciding he needed to be ""honorable"" and warn Cersei about what he was about to do. 

And I think Verys has been rethinking the whole Dany thing for a while now. (Ditto Tyrion. Though he's fighting it a lot harder.)",">She knows very little about Dany...

I'd say Sansa knows quite a bit. She's been observing Dany and testing Dany during the entire buildup to the Long Night battle. She found Dany wanting. 

She witnessed Dany showing little to no care about the health of her Northern troops. She witnessed Dany showing discomfort over Jon's popularity with those troops. She witnessed Dany's single-minded focus on gaining ultimate power. 

Sansa has seen the corrupting power of unchecked ambition. She knows that Jon's secret (which she also knows, Dany knows) means he is a threat to Dany's goals. Sansa took the kind of action that might work towards keeping Jon safe and alive.

It required breaking her word to Jon. So yeah, a bit dishonorable. But consider what Ned's honorable move of warning Cersei did. Sansa will have learned the lesson well. Fuck honor. This is a life and death struggle.","Watch again, Jon was listening. He straight up asked her ""Who else will come? We've talked to everyone. We have to work with the men we have."" She said nothing.

And watch her smile when the Lord throws shade at Jon. Sansa loves it, loves being complimented and recognized as better-than. I don't think it's explicitly about usurping but its definitely not a ""good of the realm"" thing.

I hear what you're saying about all this but it feels way too generous to Sansa. My opinion remains unchanged but I feel I've already made my case and don't need to respond to all of this.","I love how book and TV varys are in support of a Aegon, let it  be known the writers understand the books but also the limitations of making it either visually believable(practical) or staying true(which is impossible because we get inner thoughts in the books in the show we get hardend looks).",We all have our reads. :) We'll just have to see how it all works out in the end.,"Anyone else realize just how badass this trailer is, based on the fact that there is ZERO words spoken in the trailer..",Just noticed that. Thank you for making it 100 times better haha,"I don't know how, or if it's even possible, but I wonder if Gendry (aw, sweet, rejected Gendry) will make armor for Drogon which might explain the confused look Euron has when he looks up at the sky. But I also look like that if I look at the sun, so...  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  I don't know what kind of armor would sit on a dragon, much less protect it from those crazy scorpions. 

I wonder if Euron caught on that Tryion knew about Cersei's baby so soon after he found out and turns on her himself. I doubt he'll be the one to destroy her but he might retreat or stay on for the fun. I definitely think Ninjarya is on her way to take care of Cersei, whether she does so, I'm not sure. She'll have some role to play in Kings Landing. The hound is definitely on his way to face the mountain. I hope he survives.","While Dany has to survive at least the war, I don't know how the dragon does. Those bolts have obviously got the upper hand against them, but it seems (from the preview) that a little overcast might help. 

&#x200B;

I don't even know what to think about Jamie. Remember how Cersei cut him out after being held prisoner too long? How will she not kill him after he ditched her for her enemy? Somethings up. Possibly ties it in with Bronn. Like, really? You get sent to kill them and you leave after 3 minutes with only Tyrion's word? A lot of people speculated that Tyrion was going to betray Dany for Cersei, but after this episode, I don't think Tyrion will ever side with Cersei. He might join Varys and support Jon, maybe, but not Cersei.

&#x200B;

I can only imagine how Dany handles episode 5.","Jaime hurt Brienne to spare her. He wants her safe at Winterfell. 

Cersei is probably on her way too grab her up right now.

Sansa is acting ever more Littlefinger-ish. Finally. 

Jaime is going to kill Cersei, possibly for killing Brienne.

Tyrion is gonna switch on Varys and Dany is gonna light his ass up. Then he's going to realize she is the Mad Queen.

Jon is also going to realize she's batty and kill her.

Hopefully he pulls his UncleDaddy's move and gives the throne to Gendry. 


Speaking of UncleDaddy Ned; the next time he sees Jon he'll tell him about his mother.",There are more dragons out there.,I think there might be something in the theory that Drogon has had babies in Valeria for the past 2 seasons. Would be awesome after Rhaegar's death,I think Jaime is returning to kill Cersi. Remember the prophecy? Or is Arya going to do it? Hmmm?,"The Mountain kills the Hound, Arya takes the Hounds face & kills the Mountain. 

Bran does nothing, his 'powers' have been hyped up, bit like the Night King.

Cersei kills most of the rest then dies giving birth to her baby. The baby is Azor Ahai. 🤷🏻‍♂️","I think there's something in Varys' reminder that his obligation is to the realm. We already knew that, the showwriters wouldn't remind us for no reason... He will do something to steer the plot and deliver the Iron throne to whomever he sees fit. Not sure what or for whom even though Jon seems the most obvious candidate.","Jamie kills the Mountain:  ""I've been waiting my entire life to tell tall person jokes! Here's to climbing the Mountain!""

Jamie also kills Cersei by smashing your sociopathic face in with that golden fist of his.","Daenerys is becoming more and more like the Mad King. My prediction: Tyrion likely betrays Daenerys for Jaime's sake. He is most likely burned for his treason. After Cersei is killed, Daenerys probably burns Sansa alive too as Sansa doesn't accept her rule- is in open rebellion and opposes what Dany did to Tyrion and that is the moment when Jon finally kills Daenerys, fulfills the prophecy and becomes Azhor Ahai. This gives purpose to Tyrion, Sansa and Daenerys as all 3 contribute to the fulfillment of the prophecy, to finally make Jon do what he would never otherwise have done and rid the realm of monarchy. Maybe he'll give up everything and go back way North after it's all over. He hasn't ever wanted to rule. Arya likely survives. Unsure of the fate of Bran/three-eyed-raven though. I expect Bran will have a role to play in bringing about the events towards the fulfillment of the Azhor Ahai prophecy, perhaps knowing that Sansa and Daenerys will have to die for the same.","[Spoilers if you aren’t caught up - ENJOY!]

Cersei - obviously I think she's horrible and awful, but damn - what a well-written and amazing character for a story.

Tyrion - amazingly brilliant (except for in season 8, apparently), and also very interesting character. We don't often get to see a character such as him, as a dwarf, play such a forefront role.

I'm rewatching (again) and yes, she was annoying in the beginning, but she was supposed to be! ""Ohh Joffrey. I'll be a queeeen."" She has definitely grown into this powerful woman and a force to be reckoned with. While she's grown less selfish and more caring for her people, Dany has grown more selfish and power hungry. It's so interesting to watch those dynamics with both women. Arya has always known who she was and trained to be a better version of that for herself. I love how George wrote these female characters. (And I suppose D&D as well.)","I never got why Sansa got so much hate! A lot of girls grow up wanting and believing things like she did: it's all based on childhood false beliefs.

And maybe something like 3 most hated characters too",Cool. :),"No, I think it’ll be connected to the Three-Eyed Raven, the Faceless Men, and the Lord of Light. I think the NK’s death paralleled how Renly, the strongest claimant to the Iron Throne, was toppled by one assassin in the night. Now the remaining episodes will be about the remaining powers using the living to fight a proxy war against each other. 

The twist will be that they’ve been pulling strings from the shadows this whole time.","I really enjoyed this clip, thank you for sharing. 

Just a minor nit, but I personally would not rank Shireen's death and Hodor's origin story as being the top twists in the  series. Perhaps top 5, perhaps. Of course, this is just an opinion on my part, but the death, and rise of Jon Snow, and the moment Snow is revealed as  Aegon Targaryen, are probably the biggest plot twists for me... honestly I get good bimples every time I return to that scene. Both events had such a heavy impact on the plot also. (The red and purple weddings were pretty wild too, but not as plot impacting as what happened to Jon Snow..)

Those two minor little nit-picky things aside, love the video. Great analysis.","[spoilers btw but if you’re seeing this you probably already knew that]

I’m kind of hoping that Jon Snow or Bran becomes the NK - just because I want to see Kings Landing get smashed by undead (but with bran or Jon at the helm the innocent could be spared).

Because like - for me white walkers were my favorite part of the show, the NK I’m pretty sure had motives and something resembling a personality (so a new one could too) annnnnd everyone’s like dead - so a new night king could instantly make an army 10xs larger than Cersei’s :P 

So I’d say I really hope the third twist is related to White Walkers (but this is also just me reaching for a way for them to have a second white walker war scene :D)",Cersei about to lose but unleash greyscale to those that are living in kings landing and the south. I'm sure Qyburn can find a way to spread it quickly maybe his little birds. Qyburn may even know how to control the stoneman. A new wall will be made on around the infected area. Dany and John win the war but most of the kingdom is lost.,">The twist will be that they’ve been pulling strings from the shadows this whole time.

That's an interesting thought. Are you thinking that perhaps we see more of the white walkers? Or more dark magic? For me, magic is an incredibly important element of this series. I think I grieved more for the potential loss of plot-impacting magic than I did anything else, when the NK got wacked...",">good bimples

Fits all the criteria: scary, disgusting, brutal, terrifying....","Yes, but I think the NK was probably a Robb Stark sort of character: smart on the battlefield, but not overly sophisticated outside of it.

I’m more inclined to think one of the dragons dies to a scorpion bolt, with Drogon being my guess. The loss will push her over the edge.","Bittersweet, I had something to add but it didn't make sense and went off topic in my head.","You're right that Dany will freak out mad king style. She's twitching mad and hungry for revenge, ignoring all of her earlier logic.

However I don't think Jon kills her. Jon is Ned's boy. He's true to his pledge to the end.He will be able to talk her out of it. He's the only one who can. It is Jon's honor and mercy that will save Dany's life.

They will marry. Tyrion's plan will work and they will be king and queen against all odds. - This was foreshadowed in the first few episodes where Tyrion questions his own intelligence but others say he is the wisest man in winterfell.

However Dany cannot have the throne. This was foreshadowed in the house of the undying.

We fast forward. Dany is pregnant. - Both Daenerys and Jon's mothers died while giving birth to them.

Dany dies giving birth to Eddard Targaryen.

EDIT:

I just realized... there is another route. Jon and Dany die.

Bran outed Tyrion as a Targaryan at the hearth scene that was cut.Tyrion - Sansa provide peace across the realm. Sansa trusts Tyrion. Varys trust Tyrion.

She may lose dragon during her tantrum and give up after and ask Jon to kill her.,I think Tyrion will he King of casterly rock. Jon and Dany will divide the seven kingdoms.,"The script leaks have been spot on so far and some of this is from that people are being clever being like "" I think this is going to happen"" when really there have been hanging about in r/freefolk and read all the leaked scripts","I have to admit that the Dothraki thing, while wildly cool to watch, was poorly done.  [u/Gameofstones\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Gameofstones_) posted a clip that posits a more suitable tactic would have been placing the Dothraki on the flanks of the battlefront and then letting them charge to the center is the wights attacked.

He does not have the power to control, or shape the reality of others. He said as much when he was speaking with Jaime in episode 2. Based on that, in his present condition, I just don't think Bran represents a great power imbalance. But then again I also admit I am not a huge expert of the books, the books might say otherwise...","3ER doesn't really have any power, Bran does have Warg powers, but others do to. 3ER, as he stated, is just a living memory of the world, and can peer into the past (not change it as most people think, the instances we see where we think he affected the past are just how they happened time loop stuff). The reason the NK wanted him dead is because he wanted to destroy everything, and 3ER can't be left alive if you want all memory of the world gone.",Why Tyrion wanted to talk to Bran? Dude bran literally can see the past who wouldn’t want to talk with him. Tyrion won’t betray Dany. He hates Cersei and knows that she isnt worthy to be queen,"Oh but I think Tyrion will betray Dany the second he knows Jon is the rightful heir. And I guarantee Varys has already done it, or knows about it. Dany is a foreigner, regardless of her parentage,  and way too much like her Daddy and her advisors have noticed. Tyrion and Varys have the 7 Kingdoms at heart, they fight for the people (or so they say) not for Dany. Ergo Dany is better than Cersei, but John is way better than Dany.","Have to believe you’re in the minority’s on that statement.

Cheers","Tyrion has been wrong too many times, which means he's about to right in a big way. We're being directed to mistrust Dany, but Tyrion assures Jaime she's the real deal. No way she and Jon both make it through this show. I'm thinking she internalized Jon is the rightful heir and sacrifices herself to save him during the battle in either Episode 3 or 5. She only wanted the throne so badly bc she believed it to be rightly hers. She's already verbalized that's no longer the case. She goes down a hero. 

In Season 5, Jaime says he wants to die in the arms of the woman he loves. I think he does, and that woman is Brienne. I think Brienne lives and becomes Lord Commander of the King's Guard, probably to Jon but possibly another such as Tyrion. 

I think we'll get some background that pulls together loose plot ends from Battle of Winterfell, and there will be a ""shock and awe"" event that isn't expected, mostly likely an event central to Varys' character arc and/or the conversation between Bran and Tyrion in S8xE02.","Jon is undead which I always have to remind myself...

I think Tyrion dies saving Jamie from Bronn. As Jamie needs to confront Cersei one more time. 

I think the Hound has to fight the Mountain. 

Sam returns to be Lord of his house","Yeah, I don’t think they’ve hit that obligatory “female power” scene yet, (unless you count the Dany/Sansa scene). Otherwise, most of those characters aren’t the heads of their houses, or possibly even alive. Martell is probably dead by now, Euron is the head of the Greyjoy family, and Dany isn’t the head of the Targs. 

While Jon won’t go ranging north of the wall (why would he? The dead are gone and the wildlings are allies and south of the wall), it is possible that he dies. Maybe. Although we’d need a purpose as to why the Lord of Light brought him back (similar to Berics arc). And even then, while Jon dying could be an ASOIAF-appropriate course to take, he’s undoubtedly the main character of this TV series, and they can’t easily kill him off and expect good reactions. 

Just my two cents.","The series teaser showed Jon’s sword on the ground at the wall. That’s my only reason for thinking he’d go north. Maybe Bran sends him for something??
I think Euron will die, probably by the Mountain or Cersei herself. 
I really have nothing to go on apart from the series working towards five key females at or near the head of their families all with different coloured hair.

Thankfully, it’s definitely the same night.",I assumed it was the lord of light calling back melisandre. bit like a stairway to heaven if that makes sense,Thanks! I’ll rewatch.  Hoping we all get the answers we seek :),"I don't think we're going straight into another war for episode 4. There's celebrating, planning, and maybe a couple family members finding out Jon's true name etc...",what about Bronn eh?,"""A victorious army on the march with the goodwill of all Westeros for saving them from the army of the undead.""


What army? They're all dead haha",I think Bron will take down Cersei!,"If you're the writers and you know you have only 3 episodes left, you'll pull out every trick in the book. My thoughts are Cersei has remained low for the last two episodes, and is about to find out most of the others armies have been wiped out, she ain't going to sit pretty. She's gonna come in with a vengeance as she knows she's got advantage now.. her eyes set only on the throne.. whatever it takes she'll do... Cersei style!","But do the Faceless Men just work for money?  They seem to have a moral code.  I honestly think Jaqen liked Arya, and let her go.  There are plenty other assassins in Westeros though, I am sure.  And putting a hit on Dany seems like something Cersei would try.","Fact ! Arya kills the mad sea captain Urine, takes  his face then kills Cersei.  Bosch!! Job done tuta.",Mead to be consumed in copious quantities. Hank-panky to be had. Contests to see who can come up with the worst battle plans. Much work to be done.. :D,Oh right!! Bronn is the Assassin That Was Promised! I hadn't thought of that,"yea i cant say im not worried about them trying to take the throne out.

&#x200B;

the night pretty much swept out every most men in the armies danny has worked so hard to achieve and build over the last 7 seasons.   


i wonder how many men are truly left.","Didn't some leaders in the North decide to not send any men to help? They did not want to join the fight against NK, but maybe they'll join the fight against Cersei.


They still have two dragons and some brilliant schemers. Then there's the fact that Cersei's own people don't really like her. So hyped for episode 4.",I like that narrative. Just a man who hated who he was forced to become.,Makes sense really. Sometimes the most obvious explanation is the one that is true.,Occam's razor coming in clutch.,I predicted Jorah winning like 1v3 against some white walker bosses only to take a blade for danny from the night king,I thought that there would be a scene at the end showing that there are still other white walkers out there .,"You almost nailed it! Killing Jorah would have been a great way for us to realise the NK had arrived, as who else could take down someone as motivated as Jorah?","I love that we were all so excited that ‘ANYONE important could die, no one is safe’ and instead we got Edd and Lyanna and Captain Friendzone at the most.",Slow clapping 👏🏼,Love how we have a show where no one is guranteed to live by the end,That Monday holiday thing needs to be globally implemented.,[removed],"Now I’m wondering whether Captain Friendzone is Jorah or Theon. (Just kidding, of course it’s Jorah, but it could be applicable both ways.)",That actually made me laugh out loud,Or so we thought.,"You might want to fix your English before commenting,

It was pyrrhic , not plot armor and god only knows if bran altered the timeline or touched something to help everyone

We will see in how it goes",Theon’s death could have been avoided if all seeing Bran had just told him to wait 30 seconds.,If they killed too many this past episode there wouldn't be enough to kill in the battle against cersei!,"Nah he wanted Theons charge to buy him those last seconds. I mean he could have told Theon to dance as a distraction, but the 3 Eyed Raven works in mysterious ways.",They sure did great at killing the entire White Walker plot.,"I’m was on Night King’s side. God I miss him, he gave me reason to live for 8 damn year. Now what will I do? I think I have to love Giantsbane now.",They have  to be dead,"At this point I think Jaime does not get to grow old and be happy. I don't see him surviving. In which case, your theory makes complete sense. Or taking Euron's face.. Either one would work well. Cersei has absolutely no idea that Arya is out there... Although she might here about her, but she won't know she can take faces.","Can any Faceless Person become anyone or do they have to be similar in stature? Can't remember from the books if they go into the logistics. It's just an ""illusion"" and not actual ""magic"" though, right? She could've been standing on a couple of bricks when she became Frey for all we know. 

Anyway, if that kind of thing matters, much more likely she becomes Tyrion I would think.",That's definitely an interesting theory. Tyrion would have had to make some big agreements to get out of King's Landing alive. I think a lot of those will come to fruition over the next three episodes.,"That's really wild, because it means that Bran went into that situation cold.. I really wish they would have explained more what was going on. I loved the episode, but that was probably the one thing that did not work so well for me, Bran's warging not being a factor left me wanting. Well, that and the Dothraki thundering to their doom, although I have to admit, it looked really cool.",Thanks and like every game of thrones fan I hope that Arya killing the night king was the last thing we expected considering Ayra has had little experience of the wites I hope that NO-ONE (excuse the pun lol) expected her to end them and Arya wasn't the only short girl to kill a wire lady mormont deserves our respect for killing a giant please go to my Facebook account ( Steven Smith) and comment and share a post of lady Mormont killing a giant and Of Ayra killing the night king has both pics trying to get up to 200 likes shares and comments on that post Cheers for replying,"""Luckily for Jon, he’s recently been given a gift. The reforged sword of Ned Stark."" When did that take place?",This is a fan shopping house the stores should end. So Ice basically turns Dany into the night queen...,"In the future, hypothetically. Brienne and Jamie's swords (Oathkeeper and Widow's Wail) were reforged from Ned's sword, so in this theory, they hand them over to Jon (or they just die, which is also a real possibility).",More blood on the face than Arya has when she kills him,jesus what is that doll-like thing next to him,In the video you can see her eyes tracking him as he passes by.  About the 1:10.58 mark,is this confirmed or just a theory,It's possible. I wouldn't put it past them to hide her there. It would be nice if it was a little more clear. It's hidden just enough that it wouldn't spoil a first time watch.,"Good theory, but personally I'd have to disagree. at 1:17:20, you can see one of the White Walker's looks to his left, to me indicating she ran onto the field from afar. Similar to how they didn't do anything when Theon charged, they probably just figured the Night King would deal with her just as easily as Theon.",I don't see it,"It would be neat if someone could put this into GIF form, with some handy little highlighting.",just my theory.  I posted a quick video clip too that shows her better.  Or does it?,I have to disagree.  She's far enough back at the entrance to the Godswood where being really stealthy she could bust right through the pack.  What I didn't post is she is seen busting through the scenes long before this shot.  She darts through the crypts as some girl is being eaten then a few minutes later she runs by both Tormund and Grey Worm in a blur being chased through the coutrtyard.  You can see her clearly in the Crypt and Tormund shots not so much in the Grey Worm one but someone being chased is darting through the courtyard past Grey Worm just after you see her in the courtyard heading in the same direction.  I think they did all this purposefully to show a clear progression from Point A Melissandra to the photo above.,That’s how assassins work,Where is the video link?,Some redditor removed it.  Said it contained actual spoilers.  It's pretty convincing I guess.  They let me keep this photo up though.  Go figure.  I don't care enough anymore to repost it.  Just go to the 1:10.58 point on the video and you can watch it yourself.,"It was removed because you included spoiler details in the title which isn't allowed in this sub. There are still some who haven't seen the episode. It definitely made me check it out, though!",Thanks for the better response.  I kept looking at the post and the rules for Spoilers and couldn't see what the difference was.  Next time I'll vague the shit out of it.,Haha I know! It's sooo hard to be vague with all this stuff! :),So you checked out the video.  Care to share your thoughts about the theory?  Does it look like her with a bit of dead wights face (a la the hound in Beyond the Wall) stuck to her face ghosting the NK?  I know you have more important things to do here being a redditor but you are the only other person here that's seen the video.,"I watched it a couple of times and it's *possible* it was her but I don't think she did it as a wight or even wight-goo-face. I'm not sure what you mean about the Hound scene. I think it does look a bit like her, all bloodied up. I definitely wouldn't put it past them to put her there, dark enough that we wouldn't notice right away (I think I already mentioned that). Likely and easter egg.","Also, which girl do you think it is? There are two. The one on the right seems to move her head as they walk past, the left doesn't move, but is shorter.","The little one on the left is about Arya's height and hairstyle plus clothes.  Her eyes track him as he passes in the video but she stays still.  The goo stuff with the Hound references the scene where they catch the wight in the Beyond the Wall episode.  Clegane jumps on the wight who starts his high pitched scream and Sandor puts his hand across the wights face.  The wight turns his head and the face comes off in Clegane's glove and sticks to it.  It look like Arya is wearing a gooey wight face in this shot that she could have easily enough pulled off a dead wight to be her disguise ""face"".  Anyway...thanks for the reply and all you do here.",Was this after Tyrion had sat down and had the conversation with Bran? if so do you think maybe that he may have told Tyrion that the would survive the fight? or was Tyrion just trying to be optimistic?,"Yeah, it was after he pulled up the chair with Bran. I think both are possible. We were (intentionally?) left out from that conversation, so I'd be curious if he had some insight to share. I think he might have also just been optimistic. He was pretty scared in the crypt!","Thats true. I still find it ridiculous that everyone was saying that the crypts would be the safest place in Winterfell I was like""ITS FULL OF DEAD PEOPLE AND YOUR FIGHTING AGAINST SOMEONE THAT CAN RAISE THE DEAD!!"" and the fact that in Ep. 2 they reiterated the fact that it would be the safest place like 10 times haha I feel like they would have been better off just sending the women and children south to a different hold for the battle. also that little girl that Davos and Ginny were talking to about how she wanted to fight in the battle but they convinced her that she can protect the people down in the crypt DIDNT  DO ANYTHING hahaha","I mean... to be fair, she *is* a small child. A brave child! But really young. I was glad to see Gilly and little Sam survived. I think it all happened so quick, it was hard to act. And sending them further south would probably mean losing some of their soldiers to protect them *there.*","oh i know the part about the little girl was more of a joke then anything :)  But it did happen very fast 

&#x200B;

also did you notice that the first wight to come out of the wall in the crypts look eerily similar to Maester Luwin it looks like he still has his robes and chains on. but then again to the maesters from the family get buried in the crypts or is it more just for family","I did!! I was kinda hoping that the little girl was Melisandre in disguise. Oh, I'm certain it was Luwin. He was definitely family, though not by blood. He was the best Maester.","My favorite scene, the one that hit the hardest, was when he grabbed her hand and kissed it before thinking they were going to die. I love those two. I think you're on to something but at the same time, I'm not sure it's necessary to *ship* them. He could very well be out of Dany's hands (pun?) because of Dany deciding that anyway. I don't necessarily think he'll betray her. She's just getting more frustrated with him. Although, I'm sure Tyrion siding with Sansa would be a betrayal in itself. 

I also think Missandei's comment was snarky. Sansa was in no way saying Dany wasn't helpful. She was just stating the fact that the north is independent and herein lies a problem.",[Also this LOL](http://imgur.com/a/VTgBbYf),"WEll, to be fair, Missendi has literally seen Dany go after Tyrion ""our enemies, your family you mean! Maybe you don't want to hurt them afterall"", not to mention what Sansa witnessed in the Great Hall when Dany was upset at Tyrion for misjudging Cersei, as well as the Sansa/Dany convo.  I thought Sansa was alluding to that, and that Dany certainly wouldn't like Tyrion having a wife who was in disagreement with Dany about the North.  I would have thought that Missandei would have understood that as well.",I get what was Missandei trying to say but regarding her reaction to what Sansa was saying to Tyrion was completely off the topic lol :D,Haha perfect.,This pic reminds me how much better the NK looked in S6.,Credit to u/Talha_firstofhisname,"last headcanon left,burn the rest","This is genuinely brilliant, thanks for making me laugh OP!",big sad,Someone give OP silver!,"Deanarys - ""Stark, Lannister, Baratheon - they're all just spokes on a wheel.

And, she didn't sneak up on him, she tricked him. 

General rant: For me, three thing would have vastly improved this episode, which I enjoyed by the way:

1) It would have been better if they showed the NK honing in on Bran's warging activities. That would have helped explain what Bran was doing. As it was I relied on someone here explaining that Bran was warging in order to lure the NK to the weirwood. 

2) It would have been better if everything wasn't so damned dark.. They easily could have lit the shots better, and still had it feel dark. 

3) HBO needs to do something about the quality of their streaming feed. It's not at a level of professional standard required for the incredible amount of work that the artists and technical people are doing putting the show together. If I was anyone involved in this production I would be PISSED....","I thought it was a good episode. Man people are freaking out about it, it was fine, very entertaining, surprising, terrifying, emotional, I loved it. I think they are gonna wrap up some questions in the next episode. Give them a chance ya know haha.","i don't really have problems with her killing him. or him getting instagibbed in the first episode of the battle (although it did make little sense to risk himself like that)

i have a huge problem with there being no other depth to the NK/bran interactions. nothing said. no other revelation as to why NK would forfeit his safety and thus the entire wight army when any rando could tear bran to pieces.

no, just a cheap last second save that i would expect from a marvel movie or LotR. that's what is really bugging me right now.","Yesssssssssssss she is totally ""no one"" capable of the sneak attack, shes my feisty heroine 🤗🤗",I’m just so happy I chose the right subreddit to join r/AryaWinsTheThrone !!!,"I like how everyone is like “wtf was bran doing?!?” I agree it’s stupid he just sat there but it’s not over yet. Maybe next episode we will get some clarity on what he was doing. Maybe he sent the birds south to see if Cersi was marching north and if they had time to regroup. Maybe he was just being a Frodo and sat their like a dumbass being completely useless but for some reason is a big character in the show. Who knows. Can we all just admit that it was a kick ass episode and the graphics, the shots and the “no f*cking way someone dies here!” Moments that got teased throughout the episode were amazing? Imo one of the best episodes.","Yep, I agree 100%, but I do think a line between foreshadowing has been crossed in this episode.  Two times a small girl takes down a massive foe on the second attempt.  It felt a bit contrived because they were both done essentially same exact way.  If Lady Mormont had somehow arranged to have the giant tripped over and then she dealt the final blow as she was also killed by him I think it would have been better.  But having the big guy, Giant and NK do the exact same pick up little girl move and then they both do the finishing move almost identically it seemed a bit contrived.    


I'm glad they both had great scenes I just wish they weren't so alike.  Other than that and the excessive black scaling of the whole episode I was happy.   I mean really we don't all have 8k color metered 50,000 dollar monitors like they use to edit this show on, they really needed to not darken it so much.  If you look at the ""making of"" this episode the monitors the crew are watching it on isn't nearly so dark which means it was artificially darkened as is normal but I think they went a bit too overboard on it.  I couldn't see a fucking thing for the first 40 minutes or so except when they did face closeups or anything near fire.  It was just too dark all the time and then the fog for the dragon on dragon fighting, could you tell one from the other except when they were breathing their either orange/red or white/blue fire?  Only if you could make out who the rider was.  Blah.","I just for the life of me still don't understand it... Why is it when you're a no name character, doesn't matter who you are, a peasant or a knight, wights just mob and eat you alive. Yet if you're a named character you can be right in the middle of a moshpit of undead all trying to hug you really hard, multiple times within the battle, and come out of the zombie hordes just fine. Wtf is their secret? I must know this if I am to survive our own zombie apocalypse. How could it have happened???

Oh Arya sneaking up on the NK? Euh yeah that too I guess. I was too annoyed at the night king taking his sweet ass time in the longest walk of a 2 meter distance i've ever seen to feel much about that. FFS you killed the other 3 E raven pretty quickly, why you gotta savor the moment now, it's like you're begging for someone to jump out and dramatically kill you....Oh wait",Hear hear!,She used the secret passages under Winterfell to sneak up on him and Jon.,"I think that maybe they could have done a better buildup before the kill. What if Tyrion had gone out of the crypt to help. And he would have met Jon. He would have asked what happend and then realized that they had to get to Bran quickly. Jon would have run around in panic and gatherd some of the main characters. And when Theon and the others protecting Bran had faght off all the walkers, NK and the generals whould have arrived there alone, without any walkers. And right after Theon has redeemed himself and gotten killed, Jon arrives with the men he gatherd on the way. They could have made an epic battle between the Generals and the characters and Jon could have faught NK. We get our hopes up and they make us belive that Jon is ""the chosen one"" and that he's going to kill NK, but NK defeats Jon. Then when Jon is lying there bleeding and NK is about to kill Bran in front of him, Arya Stark the faceless assasins does the exact same kickass move she acutally did in the show...Well I don't know, I would have liked something more  aleast. 

Also there was too much ""James Bond"" (cant get killed) over all the main characters.. seriously, Brienne, Gendry, Jamie, Tormund and even SAMWELL TARLEY, they were in the middle of all and in the and they all stand on top of piles of White wlakers in the end.. Not that I m not glad about that but they could have made it better.  Anyway, loved the episode. Can't wait to see the aftermath.","I wondered if the female? zombie Arya encountered and killed in the crypt was one whose face she'd take. But no, she closed the door then ended up running for her life. It did seem like she was studying them - similar to the questions she asked Gendry about them in E2. But - as we were supposed to - we kind of forgot about her in the chaos of all the other scenes that came after she ran out of the crypt. Great surprise at the end. Surprised and totally not surprised all at the same time.","OK hol up a minute, she didn't sneak up, she wasn't stealthy, she jumped at the speed of light out of nowhere, we knew she is a great assassin, not that she has super human speed.","I don't think it's a question of ""is she sneaky enough,"" it's a question of literally, physically, how did she get that close to him?

We saw multiple shots of dozens if not hundreds of undead standing shoulder-to-shoulder and multiple-ranks deep all around the grove. The generals were behind him, with more undead further back. No amount of stealth in the world will let you get through a densely-packed crowd without touching someone.

She was flying through the air, so maybe she jumped from a window? Could be. Branch of a tree? That would work too. But just saying ""she's really stealthy"" doesn't work when you have to explain how someone got through a mosh-pit of enemies.","She had trouble sneaking through a library with max 8 walkers, but jumped up behind the NK with all his WW generals and 50+ wights in the godswood? Sorry, I'm not buying it.",[deleted],"I actually like the darkness of this episode plus the blizzard that made it harder to see. 

1. Because realistically that’s how it would be in a real battle in a blizzard. 

2. It played eye tricks on you. Did your favorite character just die? Or was that zombie? 

It’s obviously not everyone’s cup of tea but I personally liked it.",I don’t understand why Bran would have needed to warg to lure the NK to the weirwood? We’d already established the NK knows where Bran is because he marked him right? So why would he need to be lured? I’ve seen this said on other threads and I’m just not following it.,I mean the night king didn’t need to track him down he already had the mark on bran’s arm,did you try disabling dynamic lighting on your tv? made a huge difference for me.,Or buy a better TV. I have HBO NOW and my streaming was flawless,"I am waiting to see more too. I feel like this was hyped like a finale, but there is still more to come. Some people freaking out like they just ruined the series. Let's wait and see.","this is what happens when you don't tie that up during the episode. people can only go off what they have seen. hopefully they delve deeper next episode but if they don't, it's a massive wasted opportunity","If you were him, witnessing your army absolutely dominating the enemy, and you just raised all of the newly dead, would you really feel like you were at risk?","Plot-wise, I don't know how Beric could see anything. Carrying a flaming sword with only one good eye can't provide great night vision.","good point here. mormont's actions sort lessen the impact of arya's, if ever so slightly.","Its almost ;ike its a tv show and they were making it dramatic. And Killing Bran was just an extension of killing the NK. He was going to savor every second of it, he's waited thousands of years for that moment. And going off of how things had gone up to that point, its not like he had any reason to rush, they were literally untouchable before that and there wasn't a single person who had given them a reason to be worried...",yeah i agree to a point. like all of the main characters on the front line surviving an absolute overwhelming wave of undead that took out everyone else in the front,Dragon jump?,Trouble? Homegirl escaped that room like a champ. The only thing that gave her away was the blood dripping from her concussed head (!!) which she also handled like a champ.,"One thing though: the wights in the Godswood had already stopped fighting when Arya would have been creeping up. If all that circle of wights had continued on fighting against arrowless Theon, they would’ve gotten to Bran in no time. But the NK had to be the one to do it and all because, well, plot. So if the army of the dead is just standing there, maybe it’s not so hard to sneak up. (?)",agreed,"But Arya did use magic! She closed BLUE EYES! The many faced god was her magic. Best guess, she put on a mask of some undead and sneaked up.",But she didnt succeed in sneaking up on him. He turned around like a badass and caught her midair...she just managed to kill him regardless by feint dropping her knife.,Fair points,"Yes but to tell a narrative and convey the story I don't need to actually be in the blizzard.  :)  As an audience we do need to be more clear on what's going on.  If you want to be ambigous about this one or that one's death then do that for that particular moment, blur the screen for a second as you turn the camera from point A to B and you don't quite make out what happened, it doesn't need to be that dark.  And when they shot it, it wasn't.  When they color graded it later is when they added the darkness.  If you watch the ""making of"" this episode you can see how clear everything is on their monitors during the shoot.  Even with Arya in the library creeping around the bookcases, a scene which to me made the most sense to be so dark they shot in what looked to be really decent lighting.","i liked this too, but i also noticed that the setting on my tv for dynamic lighting made it appear much darker. turned that off and it was fine. a lot of people are now on some LED variant and likely are not used to this.","I loved the low visibility, minus the streaming issues that hampered the quality, but it added a whole new level of mystique and horror making the battle feel all the more frightening. Thought that was brilliant.","i thnk because everything hinged on aryas eventual sneak attack - i think it was a way to distract the NK to make him wonder what the hell Bran/3 eyed raven was doing so that he didnt use his own greensight to ""see"" the possibility of an Arya attack.

he did of course see it at the last second but she feinted him had both his hands occupied where as she had one still free to stab him. lucky for her he didnt snap her neck instantly when he caught her .... i think he was genuinely suprised that shed have the balls to do a physical attack .....","I'm wondering if we'll see later why he warged? Or he was trying to see how far away they were and what else was happening to lead up to their arrival. Curious about that, too. He already had that sweet tribal tat locator.",I have most if that stuff disabled but I will check.. thank u,I have most if that stuff disabled but I will check..,Who can say.. so many variables.  A lot of very unhappy customers though ..,why would you take a chance after waiting basically forever to do this one thing. it's idiotic.,"I thought the same while he was indoors especially, outside offered a wider viewing range so it was more plausible but the cramped space of those halls inside the light surely reflected off the walls as well making it harder to see past them down the hall.","To be clear, I love both characters and they both deserved the moments they got I just wish they'd been a little more creative, not with Arya's kill because that fit with her character perfectly.  But to make Mormont's different they had options, she's badass, how about after he swiped her out of the way she climbed up the wall and jumped off it and onto his back as she drove her axe into the back of his neck severing the spine and him dropping like a rock, but as he fell he turned around and fell on her dealing her final death blow with his.   As I say they had options.","Agreed, certainly reminded me I was watching a tv show, all it did for me was to make it farcical instead of dramatic, if this was 20 years ago I'd be expected Scary movie style parodies of the last 20 mins of this episode to be everywhere for the next few years. For goodness sake even the music felt generic (my exact thoughts when the music started happening: this is the most generic wannabe dramatic music i've ever heard omfg) and yet like it was trying too hard. Contrast that to how the episode started where even though was tons of sillyness too, but at least it justified the visuals of an army of flaming weapons extinguished in the dark and the music felt unique, i didn't think to myself ""yup i'm watching a tv show"".

I found the NK so silly on multiple levels, good on you if you want to defend him though.

Edit: angryjoe did a vid that summed up a lot of my thoughts about the episode, showing my opinions ain't contrarian nonsense \^\_\^","Remember when Bran is walking among the dead? Do any of them notice it? Do any of the NK generals notice it? As far as I know, none of them do it.  The dead only obey what the NK wants. He decided to keep quiet so he takes care of Bran himself.",[deleted],"When she dropped the dagger she was actually tricking him, so yeah, she did succed to sneak up on him.

It was the only way anyone could've killed him, with a trick. I don't think anyone was capable to beat him in a *fair* fight.",Not sure why you're getting downvoted. This is excellent technical information you're providing.,">  we do need to be more clear on what's going on

No we don't. The whole point of the bulk of the actions scenes was to create panic. We're not entirely sure what's happening, just getting quick glimpses. For me, it see the tone perfectly.",I didn’t even think about that. I have an older TV so I guess I’m used to darker screens.,I've got a 4k TV and 150mbps internet... no issues,"I'm saying if you were in his position you wouldn't look at it like it's ""taking a chance"", you'd look at it as the final act.","Im not defending, I didn't write the show. My point is that its entertainment, if you're going to get butthurt that a show about dragons and fantasy kingdoms wasn't realistic enough when the young girl trained as a shapeshifting assassin killed the undead, zombie lord, ice king, it may be time to start watching documentaries with your grandpa.","> For goodness sake even the music felt generic 

Can't agree with this less myself. I thought the music built the emotion in the last 10 minutes perfectly.",True. Which is why Arya probably had an easy time sneaking up... :/,"I keep hearing people say she tried to ""sneak up"" on him. I don't think there was anything sneaky about it. She did trick him though.",plenty of the main crew could take him down in a 1v1 and the right weapon. his strength was in sending in waves of undead to take the risk for him. why then did he not just let them kill bran? no he walks in there like puff daddy in a rap video so he can be conveniently one shotted 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄,And there is no fair fight with him.  Jon tried that earlier in the episode and NK did his arm raising thing and that was it... brand new batch of dead....,Well shit how about I lock you in a closet and blindfold you and put earplugs on so you can REALLY enjoy the episode.  Is everyone replying this completely daft?,"I agree, it helps if you turn subtitles on",good for you.,not really. not at all. there are tons of living around with dragon glass/valerian steel and all it takes is one pin poke to end everything you worked for. it was done for one reason: to allow him to be killed.,"This is silly, internally consistent logic is required for **any** show. Having fantasy elements doesn't mean you can just drop logic altogether.","I'm not butthurt (and you hardly come across as impassionate either, you don't seem to be discussing in good faith but mostly using rhetoric so yeah, what a pointlessly silly and provocative thing to say, needlessly poisoning our conversation) and you're the one who is putting words in my mouth and trying to inflict a ""gotcha"" on me that I never particularly cared about. And you are defending the NK's behavior and trying to justify it, didn't imply more then that nor that you were writing the show.

Arya assassinating the NK was so bottom of my considerations and didn't think much of it until saw others like OP mention it. Hence why my comment was focused on something else entirely and only at the end i was like ""oh yeah arya killed the nk"", as an afterthought and a response to OP otherwise my comment would have been completely offtopic and unrelated to the thread. FFS I go off more on the NK's walk then I ever say anything about arya killing the NK even. That you make it the crux of your whole post was in very poor faith. For someone who isn't defending the show it's a surprisingly emotional reaction.

You can use absurdio reductio all you want,  but yes, Arya killing the nk was silly for a whole host of reasons you can find other people extrapolate on, heck angryjoe did a 50+min vid reflecting a lot of my own thoughts just worded much better if you really are honestly curious. The presence or absence of fantastical elements does not change much, i'm still allowed to find x or y nonsensical within the context of the story.","That you said it built the emotion might be a clue as to why you cared for the song more, for me the spell and illusion of danger or the threat of the NK had been broken by that point so it came off less as building emotion and more reenacting every single cliche and trope you'd find in a standard fantasy tv show. Game of Thrones was meant to be breaking the mold once upon a time, now it has become the mold and the music reflected that imo which is likely a factor into perceiving it as generic.

In a few months/years time people go over the best music of GoT, music like what they used at the start of episode will in consideration but I highly doubt this track will be breaking the top 10 and only reason people would remember it at all is due to associating it with emotional moments.","Not defending the NK's actions, I don't see any need to. What is illogical about after almost ten millennia, he takes his time to soak up the moment that he's been waiting for? The WW's literally had nothing to worry abut up until that point, they were completely dominating the battle. Im not particularly passionate about it, I enjoyed the episode and I dont really have much vested in whether others were disappointed or not. I just dont understand the outrage, the way this played out was perfectly in line with what the show has done since episode one. When have things worked out the way they were ""supposed"" to? There have been numerous examples where you get invested in a character or an outcome(Robb?) just to have it completely flipped. I get it, people want Azor Ahai and John Snow to kill the NK with flaming sword and all that but the show is called Game of Thrones, we knew what the climactic event was going to be and it wasn't the battle with the dead. There is literally half a season left and people are acting like nothing will be resolved. If you want to reduce my explanation of the NK's actions to reductio ad absurdum, thats certainly your prerogative but that doesn't make it any less valid.","> I highly doubt this track will be breaking the top 10 and only reason people would remember it at all is due to associating it with emotional moments.

This will fit there perfectly :D,That was an exhausting episode.,"Didn't make one bit of sense that entire episode...   
Arya is told by Milasandra ""And Blue eyes.."" has an epiphany... runs off past all the dead outside and flooding Winterfell, runs past Jon and the zombie dragon... somehow sneaks past all the dead at the wyrward tree.... sneaks past the white walkers... Night King is the only one that knows what's up and gets stabbed anyway by a 16-year-old some girl and dies... a guy that's been around for centuries dies in one blow from an assassin with no explanation of how she did it...  


This episode looks more like swiss cheese than actually closing up any storylines.","Arya is a trained assassin, so her creeping through toward the night king isn't that far fetched and she used Valyrian steel to kill the him right where he was made into one by dragon glass. She was able to do it because she was badass and skilled.",I think there will be a lot of explanation in the next episode. Let's give them a chance before going all crazy.,BUT IT FEELS SO FREAKING CHEAP...

Because right now it just looks like from this episode, they're trying to rush this series to a close and just giving us what we want without doing true compelling story-telling... It's very stupid on their part.",I think so too (or hope so). I mean what else are they gonna do with the rest of the episodes?,"I feel you. Listen to u/Dirtybirdsalltheway I'm sure there will be an unfolding through the next episodes. Bran is still alive and raven-y. I'm hoping there will be more backstory of what happened and how to prevent it from happening again. The night king was made for a purpose. Another war is coming. Also, they're ending the series and have to kinda squish a lot into these last few episodes. It's ok to be upset about it not going how you want. A lot of us will be.","He has had tons of back story and setup man! It's just simple and not some crazy ass fan theory like everyone has cooked up waiting over the past few years. He was created by the Children to kill all humans, he got out of control, they teamed up to beat him back, now he has returned to complete his goal. He killed like a Million people in the process, what more do you want. They say this like 20 times lol.",God I sure hope so.. I will be so angry at the writers for ruining this series if they just leave it like this.. It feels so cheapened and down-graded from the immense build up and anticipation..

The opening title sequence being updated for every episode in this season is amazing.

Arya was probably the only human who could have sneaked up on the NK. Jon forshadowed this when they reunited in the same spot she ended up killing the NK.

Just thinking back to arya/melissandre scene again...they hesitated when they said "" blue eyes"". Great micro-foreshawdowing.

I'm so done with Bran. He's just a big hard drive. No help at all. I really hoped he would have warged into Viserion. Warging into ravens did what exactly? N A D A. 

Hound. Surprising that he gave up, when he had seen the vision in the flames, he knew there was something bigger at play. But adorable that he and Arya save each other during this ep.

Lady Mormont. Most poetic death in the episode. The littlest kills the biggest.
Jorah - we knew it was coming but I still cried loads. Esp when Drogon hugs them. 😭😭😭😭😭
RIP House Mormont.

Poor Theon. Omg he just had a horrible life. Bran was a douche, stoned look just giving a cold goodbye. Like sorry buddy, just here for the memories. But nice Bran gave him validation.

RIP Eddison, 
Beric. (Some now say he was Azor Ahai because he saved Arya who saved everyone.)

Can we get a Hunger Games-style roll call of the LIVING? Jamie, brienne, gilly, sam jr, grey worm, podrick, gendry (but looks alive based on the teaser for next week?), all unaccounted for. Also,
Is the Reed chick ever coming back? 
--looks like Ghost and both dragons in ep4 trailer ...phew!!


Anticlimactic:
-Melissandra suicide. I guess she had a pact, but I dunno
Maybe she was tired of the effort of magic to keep her alive to. But she literally died before the dawn. Sad even though she did some crazy things.
-So NK dead. I was really hoping for more there - battle aside, the nerd in me wanted more answers before they're all gone. Hey at least we got one smile out of him. 

Gut wrenching for grey worm to have to cut off his own men, sacrificing them.

Wimps of Ep 3:
- Oh Sam. Shoulda just stayed back. Maybe Eddard would still be alive.
-Varys.
-Bran
-Me!!!
I'm not a horror / undead thing fan. I scare easily for fake stuff like that (ironically not like that for real life stuff) so I will have to rewatch. I had to look away a few times as I was too stressed!!! 

Goosebump moments:
-All the swords being lit by Melissandre.
-The scene were the 2 dragons are above the clouds and they dive down -omg that was a thing of majesty.
-Tyrion and Sansa shared moment - last stand. 

I had a stomache and headache and was shaking like a leaf from this episode. Dear lord GOT.

Edit: Eddison

P.S. what exactly did jon think was gonna happen by screaming at Viserion right before Arya kills NK? Kinda funny looking back at that.","Why NK is immune to Dragonfire but sensitive to Valeryan steel?

Where did he go?,"Officially called ""The Long Night""","The dead that were rising in the crypts, were they old Stark ancestors or wights that broke through the walls?

ETA: I screamed HOLY FUCKING SHITBALLS!!!",I’m still hoping for a mountain vs hound fight. Anyone else?!?! #teamhound,Theon’s character arc throughout the series was incredible,"I have read most of the comments here, but in my opinion the whole series needs to give us a better understanding about the motives of the NK. I personally believe the idea of him killing Bran just so he could erase the memory of the world seems ridiculous because a few seasons ago no one else knew about the existence of a three eyed raven let alone be affected by him. So I believe they should have done much more about the NK's story than just having him get stabbed by Arya ending the character as one of the guys playing minor roles. He must have had a reason for leaving all the spiral symbols all over the place and I feel an ending for his character like we saw in ep. 3 is a total understatement to say the least.",Is there an army left to deal with psycho Cersei and horny Euron?,And what were they thinking with the Dothraki....?????,"I thought it was interesting that Missandei was pissed and scolded Tyrion and Sansa for talking about Daenerys by stating that they would all be dead if not for her but a Stark literally saved Westeros, for now anyway.","After watching this episode, I don't think either Dany or Jon deserves the throne",Television cannot get better.

It doesn’t seem like the wights die from a fatal stabbing ie frost giant that was killed with a stab in the eye and suddenly breaks down into pieces. 

Another thing that I’m not 100% sure of the answer is, can wights that have been killed, resurrect again?","I see everyone complaining about the NK being defeated too easily and too quickly.

I think these people are forgetting something. Throughout GOT seasons, the major plot events tend to group at the end of the season. Ned's beheading, blackwater, red wedding, jon's heritage, etc.

Y'all are being played - The real stuff is still coming. The battle with the night king was only a small part of the story they're telling this season... you just wait.. I'm sure it's gonna be epic.","I think Jorah Mormonts Death has to be in the Top 10 in the series. 

My character also died in this episode fighting the Night King and got to give a faint smile as the sun dawn broke.","Absolutely the best episode of the series, the directors literally had you go through a emotional roller coaster as if it was Saturday night blockbuster.","First off, spoilers for those about to read this... Don't know why I would need to say that since this is a discussion on the latest episode... but regardless I want to be sure I make that known.  First time posting on this subreddit so I want to get straight to the point.  I am posting this because some things REALLY bothered me about this episode... more than usual. While the episode itself was FANTASTIC. Very well done, kept my interest the entire time, and the action scenes were superb. There were some plot issues that really bothered me this episode and maybe someone on here can explain them to me.

1. Why was Bran in WOG mode basically the better part of half the episode? He wogged into a murder of crows essentially, we see them fly past the night king. Then the focus is on him and then generally switches back and forth through various scenes. Bran is in wog mode the entire time though. For what purpose? Why stay in that state so long only to come out at that specific time the night king arrives to kill him? There is zero information as to why he did this, normally when he does in past episodes there is some specific reason as to why and it is shown. Why not this time? If no purpose is given at the end of the series, Bran basically twiddling his thumbs and flew around with crows the entire episode while everyone else was doing something to help. Very odd.
2. This is probably my biggest pet peeve not necessarily about the episode specifically, but the series as a whole. WHAT THE HELL WAS THE NIGHT KINGS PURPOSE FOR DOING ALL THIS?! Yes I know, he wanted to bring about an eternal winter, and Bran was the one person that could stand in his way in making that a reality. BUT WHY?! Was it for revenge against the children of the forest? If it was, why attack men? How was he going to make an eternal winter? What sent him over the edge to do this? White walkers, and presumably the Night King, have been around for a very long time. Why build up an attack now? What changed? What do all these bloody symbols with body parts we've been seeing since season 1 mean! His whole purpose is shrouded now in darkness and there are 3 episodes left, and it's going to really piss me off, as a viewer, having watched this series since day one. Only to find out the enemy that has been a mystery this entire time is to remain a mystery. I'd hate to see, what I believe is, one of the most iconic characters of the show is remembered as just fodder for a cool battle to draw out the series.
3. This is actually a very small detail that bothered me. I'd be OK not knowing about this one, but it would bother me if I saw this episode again in the future. How the hell did Arya sneak past all the dead, and white walkers to take out the night king? We see her talk to Milasandra about blue eyes and runs off. I'd assume she played a dead person - or perhaps a white walker? To infiltrate their ranks and take out the night king... BUT HOW... I want to know specifically how she did it? She was struggling to survive the entire episode fighting off these hordes of dead soldiers, even sneaking around a library to avoid their gaze... but then just walks past ALL OF THEM TO KILL THE NIGHT KING!! HOLY MOLY IS THAT PART FRUSTRATING!  

TL;DR 1. why was bran in constant wog mode the entire episode, it basically did nothing and served no real purpose2. So the night king is dead, and we never truly learn his intentions. 3. Arya struggles to fight the dead, avoids being seen by them in a library, but ends up sneaking past a whole group of them and white walkers to assainassassinateight king? HOW?!","This episode was not bad in many ways, but it's the worst elisode of the show by far and there are only a couple ways to redeem it.

But first of all, what in the actual fuck?  How can the White Walkers have such a stupid fucking weakness?  And if they do, why is the Night King ANYWHERE near the battle?  He's been nothing but genius and then he randomly gets his entire species killed by being the stupidest fucking dumbass ever.

The only thing that could make sense is that he and Bran have some crazy history because killing him was obviously very personal to the Night King.  If his entire purpose was to kill Bran then that was the dumbest shit ever.  He could have killed Bran a billion times over with any of his soldiers.

Idk why everyone is so happy about this episode.  They may have just made the entire thing pointless.  They should have just killed the fucking Night King in the first place.  Have Bran way further out and then have Arya assassinate him oit of nowhere like she can clearly do.  Bam, war is over and the living all live.  What the fuck.

Also what even is there left to do now?  I don't give a fuck about Cersei or the Iron Throne anymore.  All I care about is Bran, the Night King, and what Tyrion and Bran talked about for so long.  Nothing at King's Landing is interesting in the slightest anymore.  The main villain of the whole series is dead, why are there more episodes?  Unless the white walkers aren't actually dead or something.  God damn there better be some payoff coming.

The worst mistake was killing Oberyn.",Is Gendry and/or Greyworm dead? Does anyone know?????,Can we have a head count of who who’s important survived the battle,"At first, I was so proud to see Arya kill NK. But honestly I'm kind of irked that it wasn't Jon. I know it  was meant to be a twist for Arya to kill NK, but what does that mean for Jon's arc? GoT has been building up this prince/princess that was promised shit ""and we all know it's Jon"" but what is his purpose now? Killing the NK was what made him the chosen one, so if that's not fate why the hell was he brought back to life? I'm going to be super fucking pissed if Jon was only brought back to give Daenerys a baby because that just simplifies his whole character arc into a baby daddy.",Yes i damn near cried lol,"Just thinking about how far Greyworm has come. He went from live and die by the sword for no specific interest of his own to leading The Unsullied and above all, having developed enough free-thinking ability to act in his own interest... He was able to chose to retreat and go presumably to his love. And I’m totally romanticizing this and not wording it correctly but I think it was a necessary display for his character development.",Were the dead who entered the crypt the original occupants of the crypt or part of the Night Kong’s army?,Anyone one else really want NK to go up to bran and dap him up and all the white walkers started kneeling?,Don't Dead Open Inside,So basically Arya with a single move killed more than all the episodes in the series.,"I thought it was fantastic television, proper heart-pounding stuff I literally had to take a breather after 18 minutes, however I do think storytelling was sacrificed for spectacle, which sadly has become a feature of the second half of the series.","Is no one gonna complain about Ghost's lack of screentime? They just introduce him on the castle wall out of no where, he's running alongside Jorah, we don't see him retreat back iirc... what a fail. 
No Nymeria surprise to help save her in the library? That would have been totally random, but maybe a nice surprise at least.","Weren't there 3 wight giants in of the scenes in season 7?
But in this episode we only saw 1,did the other 2 died off screen ?","I’m not sure if anyone noticed but around the 1 hour mark of the episode, where Jon is chasing the NK. That there are no more hordes of wights in sight and it pans over to Jaime shortly afterwards killing a straggler then if you watch closely at that shot before all the fallen have risen that there’s no more overwhelming undead remaining. Basically what I’m trying to say is that they beat the Army of the Dead, at least the grand majority of it since you don’t see them flooding in or World War Z’ing the walls anymore during that shot of the NK. They literally beat the first wave as if was round 57 in COD zombies only to make it to wave 58 with barely no ammo(men) left",Also at 1:18:42 big f****** props to that deus vult looking motherfucking knight with no plot armor whatsoever surviving that nightmare. A true warrior.,They should have filled the moat with wildfire,A question I have is what did bran do for all that time whilst he was warging I know it shows a raven flying and spying on the night king at one point but it spans for way longer even till the night king is standing right in front of him!!! A theory that I have is that bran used his powers to transfer his knowledge to another three-eyed raven.any ideas?,"My theory for the end: Dany will freak out and burn Kings landing having a full blown Targaryen tantrum.  Jon and Dany will have a very similar scene to the Yiggrite/Jon scene where Jon almost kills Yiggrite except this time Jon kills Dany in attempt to stop her from burning everything. He will kill her this time because his honor will require it.  He may even need to use Rhaegal. This would give Jon a purpose this season and be that bittersweet ending that George R Martin alludes to. This also aligns up with Danny's vision where she is killed by the north after failing to reach the iron throne. Since the night King is dead, Jon is the only other north that can kill her. And when she freaks out, he will be the only one who can stop her. 
 Jon also said in a recent interview that the ending isn't anything anybody could guess. Not even his wife who was part of the show. This is an ending that nobody would guess.",I expected more from the Night King. Thought he'll die on the last episode of the season tho. But I guess they really are making Cersei as the main antagonist. Hmm.,Bran is going to bring the dead to life to help in the next battle because he is now the Night King,"I know i'm late to the party, but that ending was so stupid.  Arya out of nowhere to save the day.  It just doesn't make sense that she would be the one.  Her and Bran's stories weren't even intertwined throughout the show, or even the books.  Bran should've been the one to finish the Night King with the help of Theon, instead of wasting Theon's character on a suicide run.","Kinda uninspired and cliché, like every episode so far","This episode was for shit. The lighting was the worst I've ever seen. Most of the time I had no fucking idea what I was supposed to be seeing. Nearly all of the battle was so dark  it was black and gray blobs. Nice job assholes. 7 season run-up to this ""war"" and you completely fucking ruined it.","Why is no one talking about the fishy thing TYRION was doing when BRAN saw him and gave him a ""look""?????

Is he working for Cersei???","After due reflection my tldr opinion of the episode.

Loved the beginning and the visuals being dark felt fitting and though it was probably motivated by budget decisions, scenes like the dothraki's fires being snuffed out proves necessity can breed invention.  S+ tier of a first 30 mins all around, they really nailed the tension.

As things progressed little things began to poke out and thought the spell was shattered, started to see things more like one of the more big battle focused episodes of xeno warrior princess/hercules as felt characters couldn't die no wonder what impossible situation they found themselves in. Take Jon being right in the middle of wights after Nk raised them... I just don't see how you can survive that. Nowhere to run, its gg, but next shot you get a few mins later shows the wights attacking him in just 2s and 3s and the rest hang back. What happened to the crashing wave of death? Was still enjoying the spectacle for the most part as the cinematography was still impressive (at times maybe overdid it on darkness+shaking).

Disliked the ending for a variety of reasons but the tldr is ended up finding the NK a silly cartoon villain. Theon's death scene was decent enough though, again the visuals were beautiful, also red lady's death.

For me was an 6-7/10 episode (keep in mind don't hand 9s and 10s lightly and over 5 for me is decent). Worth watching for the spectacle, just gotta turn off your brain.

Edit:Angryjoe did a 50+min vid that reflects a lot of what I thought, seems my opinion isn't just for the sake of being contrarian after all!","Easily the best episode of Television I have ever watched in my life. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous, the acting was phenomenal and the action and emotion was intense AF!","I hated Jon's irresponsible actions:

1. Trying to stop Dany the first time 

2. Getting into the NK's nerve, so he had to rise the dead (which is 1000x more than their present enemies). He's superhero effect was too much! Trying to kill NK head on!? How many times did it prove to be an unsuccessful feat?

3. What about that scene with Sam pinned down by the wights? Jon seeem to look back a couple of times and yet ignores his friend!? 


Other Jon Snow rant:
- What was he trying to do with Viserion? Ride it? Kill it (really, Jon?). I was hoping his Targaryen bloodline would undo the ice dragon out of Viserion.

He kept charging towards it only to retreat when it breathes blue fire 😅",[deleted],"&#x200B;

Alfie Allen did such a fantastic job last night. I expected to be emotional through the whole episode but it was pretty much just Theon's ending that had me in tears.

And ended with a perfect death.,I barely knew what was happening until someone lit their sword. I changed the gamma on my laptop but still too dark.,Thank god for the lady of light.. she literally blessed us with the ability to see wtf was going on,"The Red Chick will not be coming back. And IMHO, she was Nissa Nissa, the wife of Azor Ahai. Azor Ahai stabbed her in the heart to quench the sword Lightbringer as a form of sacrifice to R'hollor the god of light. R'hollor brought her back to do a job, which she did to perfection in this episode. Do you remember the episode where she took off her neck piece and turned into the 600 year old, or older, woman? Her story came from a tale told to Davos by Salladhor Saan.","Thank you, this is really nice to read... The charge of the Dothraki was amaze-balls... An entire horde, extinguished by a wall of invincibility. It would have been much nicer to see some of it from the NK perspective, he was pretty generic throughout the entire series.",My Goosebumps moment was the Dothraki going dark.  When the dead came in like a tidal wave is a close second but it didn't give me chills.,I think Jon’s scream was his giving up to the impossible situation.,"i think Jon scream could have been a few things ; the Targaryn in him ( if he truely believes that he is a Targ )  trying to exert ""control"" over a dragon ( as Targaryns are fabled to do ) 

but i dunno if Jon knows enough about Targaryns to actually think that that was a thing let alone a thing he should have attempted ( he just learned how to ride (  sic hold onto ) a Dragon a day ago ) 

i think more it was him just screaming at the NightKing in fustration and anger  - The nightking ""saw"" thru the dead's eyes - even viserions -  Jon wanted to physically fight him and instead he was reduced to battleing thru the wights and of course he desperately wanted to get to Bran to defend Bran against the approach of the NightKing...its why he ran thru Winterfell and even seeing his best friend almost at the mercy of the undead who were overpowering him amongst all of the otehrs he probably could have aided he ran on leaving them to fight because to save Sam or the others he would have to stop moving towards Bran...","Jaime and Brienne not unaccounted for. They're definitely alive, it showed them after the white walkers all disappeared in the  spot they were fighting in for what seemed like hours","The Melisandre scene with the Dothraki gave me epic chills.

I was shaking and my heart was pounding at the end of the episode. Hubby and I just kinda sat there and went ‘WOW!’","Apparently in the BTS, they talk about since it was Valeryan steel that created him, it HAD to be valeryan steel to kill him.

Would have liked to see more from Daenerys and some stronger dragon war.",Loved the episode- but after a 7 year investment in White Walkers and Night Kings I would have appreciated one more episode in the battle (30 more minutes in two episodes ),I actually screamed when she killed him.

I’m glad we’re back to the living.,"I've seen a few others with this complaint in a few comments, and I dont agree with it. Here is why in ep. 2 while they are planning a strategy they know they cant hold of the whites forever and there only hope is to kill the NK before they are completely overrun by the dead. It kind of sucks that such a long running story ended so abruptly but its the only way for it to end if the battle went even a few minuets longer they would have been overrun and all would be lost.",*Arya / * Mormont :),I can only assume he was luring the NK to the weirwood tree.,Right?! He looked like he had no plan at the end there too.,That's what I'm wondering too. If Nk can control all the dead then why the fuck would you hide in a place surrounded by dead lol,They were the dead Starks is my interpretation...,"the Night King controls ALL of the Dead and sees through their eyes - he raised the dead that fell ( and the long dead Starks )  because of course it suited his purpose in making his way into Winterfell to kill bran.

as crazy as it sounds he saw ALL things the ""dead"" saw"" because he controlled them  and ""saw"" even his battle with Jon through Viserions eyes - ( which is why  Jon screamed in fustration becuase he was dispatching the wights that were in his path pretty handily ) so the NK put an undead Dragon in the way ...",Yes dead Starks.

In the middle of the battle the NK raised all the dead from the “living” side.,"1) Warging in order to lure the NK to the Godswood, as per their plan. 

2) This was explained over the series; He was made by the children of the forest as weapon against men. I guess the 'why now?' is that he'd been gathering strength (assuming other than wildings, beyond the wall isn't exactly full of people to convert so had to build up over time), plus maybe cause he ultimately wanted to get the three eyed raven. Something he couldn't do until he marked Bran in the vision.

3) She runs off well before there is a massive Wight presence in the Godswood. So quite conceivable she was already there, possibly up in the weirwood tree waiting. Again, as the original plan was for Bran to lure the NK there and she was present at the war council when this was discussed.","Bran flew Arya into the godswood on all the crows, simple. 😂",You're one of the only people here talking any sense.,"This isn't really an answer to your question, but 3 obviously wasn't shown so they could get the ""WOW BIG PLOT TWIST"" factor at the end which all the manchildren love.",Critique is not allowed in this fanboy shithole apparently,"Have you directly started watching got from s08e03? most of your doubts are already clarified in the show. If you kill a night king, all of them will die is a fact known since ages.","> How can the White Walkers have such a stupid fucking weakness?

This is explained in the show. Other posters above in this thread explain it better than I feel like doing.

>  And if they do, why is the Night King ANYWHERE near the battle?

He's pretty unstoppable out side of Valyrian steel. 

He gives the undead army a tremendous amount of absolutely unique and near god level weapons. Ability to actually kill dragons, raise the dead, and be immune to dragonfire. I'd say those are beyond convincing reasons for his presence. And there are not that many Valyrian Steel blades left in the known world. The human army at Winterfell had maybe 3 V.S. blades.

It was a calculated risk, and his presence was need for the aforementioned unique strategies his abilities provide.

> The only thing that could make sense is that he and Bran have some crazy history because killing him was obviously very personal to the Night King. If his entire purpose was to kill Bran then that was the dumbest shit ever. He could have killed Bran a billion times over with any of his soldiers.

Not only did the night king clearly want to killthe 3 eyed raven himself, how much time do you think the NK and the undead were actually in he grounds of the godswood after all the humans had dies? In other words, after the last human ( Theon ) besides Bran died, that were in the Godswood before and during the battle, It was not long at all before Arya killed the night king.

> Also what even is there left to do now? I don't give a fuck about Cersei or the Iron Throne anymore. All I care about is Bran, the Night King, and what Tyrion and Bran talked about for so long. Nothing at King's Landing is interesting in the slightest anymore. The main villain of the whole series is dead, why are there more episodes? Unless the white walkers aren't actually dead or something. God damn there better be some payoff coming.

Since there are 3, very very long episodes left, I""m going to reserve judgement. And I do care what happens with the Iron throne. REmember Danys vision of a Kings Landing Throne Room, giant holes in the roof, and snow inside the room?

That was from the episodes where Dany got her baby dragons back. Season 2. I am extreamly curious about that. And about Kings Landing and the fate of the Iron Throne and Westeros in general.

> The worst mistake was killing Oberyn.

I too highly disliked that happening. But, the guy was so concerned with hearing ""the words"" that it cost him his life. Not that you didn't already know that. 

He was one of the coolest characters. Not enough screen time.","Totally agree. Worst episode BY FAR. I have little interest in watching the rest but I'm sure I will just to get it over with. Thank God I pirated it all, I would be so fucking pissed if I had paid for that last episode. What a pile of steaming, stinking shit.",lol shut up.,I think Greyworm is still alive. IDK about Gendry,It's unlikely they'd kill those characters off screen,"Better the other way around. Unless there was an onscreen death, assume alive.

From next week's preview, looks like Ghost, voth dragons, gendry alive.",To lead the army against the NK in a victorious battle (not necessarily kill him although that was a byproduct that wouldn’t have happened had Jon not taken the actions he did) and/or “reunify” the 7 Kingdoms.,I’m guessing Jon was brought back to defeat Cersei and/or rebuild the kingdom. Definitely more than a baby daddy and arguably harder than defeating the Night King since he has like five soldiers left and can’t defeat all of Cersei’s forces just by killing one person like he could with wights.,"On a related note: the way the Unsullied retreated was so damn cool. Smooth, tactical and slow. Actually, I really love the whole tactical vibe of every Unsullied move",They were the dead Starks buried there.,"That's an interesting theory, but then why would he want to be protected?",Yep. Just wrong episode. This thread is for ep 3.,What fishy thing are you talking about? I think I missed that,What thing?,"I've felt like Jon has always had some kind of death wish.  Like he regrets beings brought back to life and having to fight these endless battles, just wants the sweet relief of death, and that conflicts with his sense of duty to humanity.  

Him starting down Viserion at the end was just more of that.",He was trying to get past Viserion to get to Bran.  That's also why he didn't stop to help Sam.,oh ok so you totally predicted Arya right?,Yet it looked ridiculous when she started running with that tiny axe,Lol maybe there was a bigger reason for the ravens? Or maybe he was just watching everything in 8k,Dude bran was just baiting the Nk.,"I think he had to warg, so the Night King could find him because he knew Arya had to kill him but he obviously couldn't tell anyone.",There's got to be a bigger reason that just nothing. If there wasn't that's just terrible writting on D&D's part.,"One of my comments during the fight scene last night was that Theon hadn't had enough development time to arrive at the end of his redemption arc like that.

Im pleased he did, and I get that developing every thread fully in the TV series is impossible - but if he was going to be so integral to the final throw down, I think we needed more of him in the build up",I was watching with hbonow and did not know what was going on most of the battle. The dark scenes were nearly unwatchable.,Only for a moment there. Khal Drogo could have watched out for the hordes a little better ;),"My friends think it was luring Viserion close enough to try to stab him. Seems likely as Jon is brazen/stupid enough to put himself in such danger.

I feel it was out of frustration also like you state.","I agree with your last paragraph.  I discussed with friends and they interpreted like he was trying to get Viserion close enough for a kill. Seems very Jon-like to do something that brazen/stupid. So I can buy that.

That was a horrible scene, knowing so many in peril but having to move on.",Cool thanks. I looked away a few times- the stress! I am to rewatch tonight.,"I think the children of the forest used dragon glass to make the first wights, but still makes sense that it HAD to be valeryan steel if he’s Targaryen and immune to fire and og wight immune to dragon glass.","I'm no expert on the lore, but I'm pretty sure that the Targaryens didn't go to Westeros until much later than the Night King was created. A couple characters recount the history of the Targs conquering the continent (having originally been from Essos) with their dragons. But the conflict with the Children of the Forest was with the *first men*. I'm pretty sure the first men predate any named families, although I think the northerners claim to be their descendants.

Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.","Yes, it explains everything.
Children of the forest created the first NK by pinning a guy with a dragonglass dagger. The current NK must be a Targaryen to resist Dragonfire but dragonglass and Valeryan steel can damage him","Jon was burned and Dany's brother also not immune to fire- ouch that crown melting on his head. So it just seems Dany is the the only ""unburnt"". 

I wished they would have answered that and many other questions about nk....a bit disappointed now that it is over.","Fire immunity is a Danny thing, no indication it would apply to all targaryens",other way around,Im sorry but i have to. It was too stronger than me 😂😂😂,"Lol, rip all yesterday's mods \[\*\].","I feel like that chat between the red woman and Arya kind of gave the ending away. The moment Arya said ‘not today’ I’m like ‘she’s killing the NK’
Admittedly I thought she’d do it flaming arrow style like she saved the hound, but the sneak up was better.","That was my thought. The show has always done a great job of building everything up and even though it was a longer episode, I feel like the battle was rushed? I think having a second episode would have been able to draw out more detail and you could have seen more of key characters actually fighting instead of just the little screen time they got.",Kind of agree but still feel like he didnt do much. Bran said NK ways knows his location because he marked Bran.,"Honestly I I was so annoyed and confused the whole episode. So many dumb decisions made!

Like, did anyone else wonder why neither John nor Dany burned the walkers that were just standing by the trench?? Instead, they left them with enough time for the NK to have them build the human bridges.","no his plan was to put everyone in place to either defend ( and fall ) so that Arya could eventually use her own abilities to get on top of the NK to kill him - Theon in the end realized that he would die and that he had no chance fighting the NightKing ...but it had to seem like Bran had no defenders left so that the NK would be so focused on finally killing Bran he would overlook Aryas attack. 

he told someone else earlier - if he explained to them what would happen the person might not have believed it and not been motivated enough to actually do it .",Hindsight is 20/20,">~~stone case thing~~

I also think it gave him the courage to go after the NK even though he knew he’d die.",Yeah I know they faced the NK in the storm area I was more talking about his high subjects that helped him create the army of the dead. But yeah I felt Jon and Daenerys were pretty all over.,Can someone please explain that to me?,"She made it, was next to Jamie up against the wall at the end",definitely looked like her... probably shouldn't have picked that actress to get dragged off.,It was so dark I couldn't tell if it was Gilly or not..guess not?,"I mean I get luring the Night King there, but Bran didn't need to wog to do it... Bran said himself, the night king knows where he is at all times because of the mark left on his arm.

I understand the how the night king came into existence from the children of the forest. But why attack man? Attacking man just because he was built to do it sounds like a mindless killing machine rather than a careful tactician that the night king is... He couldn't have had only the intention of killing man off... what would be the point? Just do  his purpose that the children of the forest created him for? He clearly has his own intentions and thoughts, but not his own will? Seems far off to me to just accept that as the only answer.

Most of what you're saying is speculation at this point. We don't know what Arya did, she suddenly was told by Milisandra ""And blue eyes..."" has an epiphany and runs off past all the dead, past the freaking zombie dragon ( which we know she had to have, because the dragon is shown dead and collapsed with Jon Snow's scene) and is able to run past not only the group of dead gathered at the clearing and white walkers which I would assume are more intelligent than wights to know something shifty is afoot... even the Night King with his back turned knew something was up.

It was just a very poorly written episode in my opinion. Tons of plot holes and lots of unanswered questions.",But I don't know a single person that liked that? Arya just appears out of no-where to stab the night king who was surrounded by hundreds of wights and fellow white walkers? The wow factor that man-children love is when the servant girl that slit walter fray's throat - her face was peeled off in front of us and we saw it was arya.. That was wow factor for man-children... not this lazily written hot garbage. They ruining the entire series with this shit. and it shows.,you like spending time in fanboy shitholes?,looked like arya was making out with someone in the preview for next week. gotta assume it was Gendry,"Within starting minutes when Tyrion picks up a bag or something, BRAN sees him. And well, Tyrion just stops.. and seems terrified.",At least someone did!,I thought he was just watching everything.,Brave move considering one hiccup and your a jon toastier.,"i think it lent to the desperation of knowing what was really at stake - Bran had to be protected at all costs- everything the NightKing did was to kill Bran 

my only issue with this episode is for the NK to have actually explained why or to what ends did he want to make the world ""dead"" 

what the meaning of those symbols with the bodies were - and why wait until now to ""attack"" 

thats still the big mystery - the NK has been around since the time of the Firstmen - it was a ""bargain"" that he remained in the North in the icy wastes on the other side of the Wall for nearly 10 millennia ( 8000 years) 

dragons a disappeared thousands of years ago and long before dragons disappeared people thought the White Walkers were myths 

so why attack the ""Realms of Men"" now? why not a hundred years ago?","The children of the forest used dragon glass to make the NK. He was a man of the first men, many believe a Stark. He has been alive since the children of the forest made him during their wars with men. He was the first white walker and made all subsequent white walkers. Many were taken as babies from Craster's keep. He has/had the power to make white walkers from live babies and wights from the dead.",He can’t be a Targaryen cause they came WAY later after the war. The blade might have been forged from Lightbringer so maybe that’s why it was able to kill the NK. But honestly they should’ve worked on his demise more. It’s cool Arya killed him but how it went down without a Jon and NK showdown bummed me out.,Good catch.,"Could he be an echo of Jon Snow's story - both being 'Stsrks: but ultimately Targarians? There might even be room for some three-eyed raven time tomfoolery in thst connection.

Akzo fitting that he fell to a stark who had given up her name.",Maybe that feature is only unlocked for kings and queens? I dunno.,"There is a well written theory in /r/gameofthrones which says that Bran is the Lord of Light - the opposite of the Night King.  We have seen that Bran can have an impact on the past and make changes that can be felt in his present.  If Bran is the opposite of the NK then maybe Bran can control fire.  Perhaps he is making changes to stack the deck in his present such as helping Dany get dragon eggs and an army while keeping her safe from fire. 

It's a good read!","Yeah,  Jon burned the shit out of his hand when he killed that wight in Lord Mormont's room.","IIRC, Arya gave the Valeryan steel blade to Sansa when she told her to stick them with the pointy end. I will watch it again to check.

edit: Just checked, Arya did give Sansa a knife made from dragon glass.","Oh, its all good. I thought it was funny, actually. After all, the post was clearly marked ""spoilers"" LOL",Thank you for that  :P,"There are a few more thoughts I had on the matter.  I do think some character development or motivation for NK would have raised the stakes 

I would have like the Bran - NK relationship better articulated- or maybe they have and it’s my own short coming ? 

I think more major characters should have been killed, and not to kill someone we truly love was a cop out.

I would have liked to see the white walkers blasting past Winterfell forcing Cersei to confront the terror, because if it is a battle for all humanity, she should be involved.

But truly, it was a masterpiece.  Bravo.","Well - think about it - there has to be a reason why they rushed it.. that means they need the time becasue they have something to tell that is a larger plot reveal than the night king dying to arya..  


:)","The plan was for the both of them to target NK only. 1 vs 2 dragon kinda thing. But when then Dothrakis ended up to zero, Dany felt she had to speed some things up.",I assume they couldn't see because of all the smoke/fog/whatever was in the sky,"""Jon's"" dragon fought, sort of just fell down, jon bailed out, and it seemed to take off again, we didnt see it die really, although it took some bad hits. I honestly thought drogon was dead for sure with all the wights all over him. but he came back to weep with dany.",And podrick I think? There was 3 of them together?, I appear to have been wrong on that one... :P,Probably not.. her escaping a kidnapping by wights would be a boring plotline for next episode....,"> Attacking man just because he was built to do it sounds like a mindless killing machine rather than a careful tactician that the night king is... 

Why can't it be both? A Night King that can completely control the dead has no reason to try to control the living, we know that doesn't work. He's doing what he was created to do and is really good at it. What more do you want from the leader of an undead army? The Children of the Forest created a weapon designed to survive and bring down humans. They didn't account for the fact that 'surviving' (if you're careful tactician) means killing the greatest threats to your existence first. His biggest threats are The Children of the Forest and the Three Eyed Raven. He killed the Children and his next step was to go for Bran. With the powers of the Three Eyed Raven the Night King would be unstoppable.

I could be wrong, I just thought I'd pose an alternative explanation based on what I (mis)remember after 8 seasons. :)","Arya leaves Melisandre and they cut directly to the Godswood with Bran and Theon.  As the wights soon enter and the fighting begins, the camera rises up with the tree branches covering about half of the screen as it does.  If you watch closely, there is some light wind rustling the leaves, but you can see a whole branch move and hear some louder rustling, then one above that one moves/rustles (maybe a third branch, too - I'll have to watch it again but at least two).  She snuck in right before the wights got there and climbed the tree.",I guess you haven't seen those videos of people's live reactions to Arya killing the Night King. They loved it.,"Oh yeah, good catch.","Ya just saw it, thanks.","I think the show is fantastic in many ways but the storyline of nk being killed now seens wrong on many levels. I agree there are too many unanswered questions that the show didn't address -and it's too late now. They've also shit on the Azor Ahai prophecy it seems.  So I'm just going to enjoy the show for the show's sake....adjusting my expectations. 

One of the writers confirmed after s8e1 that the spirals were to mock the children of the forest. Similar to an upside down cross...but 1) why wasn't this explained in the show 2) why mock when there's no COTF to see the spirals? Like I said, I'm readjusting expectations!",I'm predicting Sansa kills Cersei with it.,"Good point about the relationship between Bran and NK.. 

They did kill off Jorah, but he is not everyone's fave character, not like it would have been if Sansa got it... for example..

And Gillie? Does anyone know what happened to her? It looked like she was dragged off by a wight.",Thank you.  Makes sense.,Just seems a cheap way to end a villan who has been there in the background since season 1,And I guess you haven't seen the videos of major YouTubers showing their dislike of the episode and literally all the comments agreeing with them.,"Here is one.

Lots of people, like us, disliked it.",Oh cool. Good to know,Then what was your point? What's the point of telling me a lot of people liked it? My whole point was I disliked it and this episode doesn't do the series justice for these x reasons?,"I think you need to reread our conversation. 

I explained why they didn't show Arya sneaking up on the Night King. You replied that you know lots of people that disliked the ending...okay, not sure what the relevance is there but I replied that you must have missed the footage of fans going crazy for the ending which has been all over the internet.

Then you replied again that I must have missed videos of people criticising it, even though I am absolutely aware that some people (*INCLUDING ME*) disliked it.

You seem to be under the impression that I'm arguing or disagreeing with you. I'm not. I also disliked the ending. I'm not defending it. I'm explaining why it exists.",And I'm saying that I get what you're saying. I'm simply saying I think it's piss poor writing on their part and I dislike it.,I agree.,What is “bevor”? Do you mean beaver?,He's not dying tonight,"This episode had me wanting to cry, angry and ready to fkn cancel my sub, to celebrating and now I need to watch the after show as a pallet cleanser.","I think it's going to be interesting tonight, no matter who dies.

That sucks :(,"Definitely feel you man but keep this in mind. Episode two was a service to the fans. This Sunday’s episode, more than half of our favorite characters are going to die most likely. This episode was their way of tying up a few loose ends and throwing a bone to us because the next four weeks are going to batter our emotions. 

Also, I thought episode one was pretty good overall. Some great reunions, solid one liners and a reintroduction into GOT after two years hiatus.",Battle with no deaths........bahahahahahaha right....,You just ruined it for me.,Not my paycheck or the freedom to watch GOT from my desk lol,I never thought of it like that. I guess I will be grateful for these moments in episode 2 when my faves die. Cool perspective. Thanks for your comment.

I don't, which is kind of their raison d'etre.","I don't think it's possible to spoil this episode, greatest of the show and even if I were to tell someone who hasn't seen it they likely wouldn't believe it.  Amazingly well done.",True I guess but it’s a holiday tomorrow but not everyone has off for Golden Week. At least you can watch it at work :),No worries brotha.

Thanks.,[deleted],I have read that Arya is 17 in the last season.,"I would say every season is a year, so 8 years has passed...","Less than one. It wasn't winter when we started, and it just started, so... less than one.

Seriously though, 6-7, but not everything adds up. Arya is 11 or 12 in the pilot and 18 by season 8. Try not to think about it too hard.","Awesome, thanks! Where did you find out that it was 305 AC?",[deleted],But summers and winters last multiple years in GoT. I feel like it’s been around 6-8years,"This is wrong though, because how else would they measure a year passing? There's a reason the winter solstice is so close to the end of our calendar year.

I'm just gonna type whatever here because I don't think you read second paragraphs. Maybe you'll say something about stars.",[deleted],">because how else would they measure a year passing

Dude, it's a fantasy show. No on gives a fuck how they count the years, but it's definitely been 5+ years in terms of how we as nonfantastical beings define a year.

Although, tbf, it would make Arya even more badass if she turned into an absolutely devastating assassin in less than a year.","If Tyrion is older than 9, then why is he so short?","Time has passed *in the real world* because that's how TV works. But everything we've seen so far in the show has happened in the same year, obviously.

At this point I'm fascinated. Does anyone read second paragraphs? It feels like the old ""secret topic"" meme on forums where people would have a secret exchange in their signatures.",Drinking stunts your growth,"Ok, you're either really stupid or sarcastically arguing a bad point for the lolz. I'm actually not sure which.

And yeah people read second paragraphs, I just dont care that much about their content when you're the one writing them.","Seriously though what use would a convention such as a year even have in their universe? ""Oh, look, the stars are back where they were 365 days ago."" Why would that even matter? Why would they use it as a measurement?

I think this thread conclusively proves that people, including you, don't read second paragraphs. Welcome to the secret topic. Don't be mad.","I said, and I quote ""as we as nonfantastical beings define a year"". A year DOESN'T have any revelance to the characters on the show, because they may or may not live on Earth, and their rotation around their star (or stars if you buy into their whacky seasons being a result of them orbiting a binary star system) is clearly not the same as earths, as demonstrated by their strange weather patterns.

What IS relevant to us as the audience, and what OP actually cares about, is how long (in terms of a measurement that we understand) the show has lasted for the characters. So, the characters clearly have lived 5+ years of time within the show (again, our years not theirs), as shown by their aging andthe events that transpire over the course of 7 (and a half now) seasons and how long it would realistically take for such things to happen. So Arya may have been 12years old when the show started (our years not theirs), but is now at least 17(our years not theirs).

And again, no one gives a rats ass how they keep track of time in the show, because it doesnt really matter, so hop off your high horse, quit pretending like their is some secret conversation going on that I dont understand, and shut the fuck up about things you know nothing about.

Additionally, if they did orbit a binary star system, a ""year"" for them could last exactly as long as a year on earth does, but their seasons would potentially be wildly unpredictable (as they are).

And as to why people in their universe would use a long-term time tracking system... I mean seriously dude? The same reason we do.","Binary star system? Wouldn't we have noticed two stars in the sky at some point? Or characters having two shadows every time they were outside? That theory doesn't hold any water. It's more likely they'd have two moons, which might give their planet weird axial tilt problems.

And the characters in the show do use years as a measurement. Joffrey calls Jaime 40 years old in the Book of Brothers scene. So you're just plain wrong there! Unless you think Jaime is 200+ years old in ""our years not theirs.""

This is obviously something you care deeply about. Look up ""axial tilt"" to get a better idea of how seasons work. Everyone knows two suns gives you a desert planet like Tatooine.","This one just made me face palm, ngl.

You ought to be doing your research, not the other way around. You're not making any sense even after I've spelled it out for you so idk what else to say. 

Have a good day I guess?","I would like to know if the Children still play a part in the future episodes. If anything, Bran seeing the whole story behind what started it all. (Not just the glass in the heart part.)",I have been more excited for the this war than the series ending iron throne holder.,thou lesser characters art thoroughly fucked lmao,This shit has me giggling,"He honestly shouldn't be around kids. Hahaha And wtf is ""My Solar. Naked.""???",These are beautiful,Ugh love. Who designed your mask set?,But why?,I found the sigils on some artist's website who was offering the print to the public and print it on a transparency mask using a standard printer! The resolution is not very good under the microscope but looks great without.,"Did you dice it on a disco? 

Still really cool. Most people wont have the scopes so :D",Yep on a DISCO 3220!,Haha. Have the same one. 😂,She was just disappointed because it wasnt the answer she wantet to hear i think,"I noticed that too, thinking it was an out-of-character tic for Dany. Not quite a tic, but maybe a reflex we haven’t seen before. It did remind me of a movement Lady Olenna would make. She was always leaning in, moving her fingers/hands, sometimes touching the person. Dany’s movement made me recall her, so I wondered if she was harkening a Lady Olenna approach to consulting with Sansa. I know she didn’t see Olenna all those other years, but it still reminded me.

In her last conversation with Dany, Olenna said she outsmarted all the men. Sansa has been playing the Westerosi game longer, and it reflects at this moment that Sansa seems to say to Dany, ‘I’ve outlasted many men *and* women, and I’m still here—I won’t be outplayed by you. So what about the North?’

...I hope that makes sense.","Daenerys extended sort of an olive branch to Sansa, but with the intention that once the battle was over, Daenerys would be recognized as queen.

What Sansa said about the North taking back their throne and never giving it up again said that she'd never recognize Daenerys as her queen. That's when Daenerys withdrew her hand. Olive branch gone, offer to make nice, rescinded.

When the battle is over, the two women will not be allies. Either Daenerys will have to take the North by force, or she'll have to bargain away a portion of her kingdom to get the support she wants to win the rest of it.

Does she absolutely need the North? Depends on how badly her forces are decimated, post-battle. Does she have more of the Mad King in her than we realize? Her decisions may not always be rational. The withdrawal of the hand says it's not likely to be friendly...","Sansa was playing along until the North question. Then she wasn't letting Dany get away without an answer. Dany had to yank her hand away.

Dany didn't answer because of course she will try to force the North to bend the knee to her. Sansa not letting up is telling Dany that the North won't go that easily.

In other words once the big war is over there could be another war between the North and Dany.

If they all live that long.","When I saw the close up of her removing her hand, it made me wonder if this was the final scene she filmed - there was that article that talked about her final scene filmed was a close up of her hand.","i think denny is fucking selfish all she thinks of is sitting on the iron throne , that's a small example that she wouldn't give it to jon sno easily , i think something huge will happen between them something unexpected \~!",Right on. Sansas a beast! She should stand in the end with Snow :),"Makes sense to me. That's how I read it. To be honest, the whole, thing seemed contrived on the part of Daenerys. It seemed a bit forced.. ""Let me show that I am authentic by reaching over and putting my hand on yours in a gesture of solidarity that could also be misinterpreted as a passive-aggressive display of dominance."" My read on it is that was how Emily Clarke chose to play it. Like she was trying to show it as being awkward..",Those were Sansa's words but Jon already gave up his title to her. I saw it more like Sansa letting her know we can be friendly and Jon may trust you buy he's a guy and you know how men are. But for the rest of the North you have to earn our trust. So what are you going to do about it.,no don't tell me that !!,"Her entire life has been about that fucking throne. She was sold for it, her husband died for it, she suffered for it. All she is and will be has been for the throne. Hell Yeah she is selfish. And why should she give it up to that cunt? He didnt work a day in his life for it.","I know, I’m secretly Team Sansa at the end, but after all he’s accomplished for the entire realm, my gut tells me that Jon would make the better leader of Westeros. Sansa would make the ultimate leader of the North.

After she sees the dead, I think she’ll understand why it was so important to stand behind Jon.","I suppose different people can see different things. I simply assumed when Sansa said the North would never give up their throne, it meant that the North would never give up their throne. 

&#x200B;

That would be a good reason for Daenerys to withdraw her hand.",last scene filmed doesn't mean last scene!! :),">Her entire life has been about that fucking throne. She was sold for it, her husband died for it, she suffered for it. All she is and will be has been for the throne. Hell Yeah she is selfish. And why should she give it up to that cunt?

cause he is the rightful king of the seven kingdoms","Rightful Heir??? Im laughing. The throne isnt won by ""rightful heirs"", it it taken by whoever has the power to take it. The Targaryen's conquered westerors by force, Robert took their throne by force, Cersei took the throne from him by force for her children and then took it for herself by force. Danaerys has the army, the dragons and is unburnable. Fuck Jon/Aemon or whoever the fuck he is.","i think u forgot that danny is fighting for it cause she thought it belongs to her , and the army she gathered think the same not because she is fucking strong or shit ,, so now after she knew she isn't the rightful heir will she be okay with tha t i highly doubt that","[Mother of Dragons!](https://www.patreon.com/posts/26396887)

I originally did this back in 2017 (gotta find my sketch pad around here somewhere). I think I was going thru withdrawals that the show was going off till 2019 and did this during my idle time.

Was cleaning out my cloud storage, I'm over my limit, and came across it and thought I'd share it.

And in her head the choices she makes should be acceptable to everyone. Helping free the slaves most likely wasn’t any move towards actually helping people but a tactic to gaining trust and praise from the people. Throughout the show we can see her being narcissistic and self absorbed, I think as soon as she got a taste of real power it went to her head so now in her head everything she does is perfectly within her right and moral. She wants everyone to look at her and see nothing but the perfect queen, because in her head she is the perfect queen. But that’s just not reality. If she truly cared about being a good queen she would have stayed in the east and ruled over the Dothraki or something. But she came west because at the end of the day all she wants is the iron throne and doesn’t care what it takes to get it.",It makes so much sense. That was such a dumb move on her part.,"It's very hypocritical. Now that you mention it, she and Jaime are just alike, seeing as how they both did what they felt needed to be done during war time and think that what they did benefits the greater good.","She's following the path of her father. Selfish, and power hungry.",I thought this same exact thing when I watched it,She probably views Jaime as the reason why her family was disposed and every hardship she ever had to go through is a result of his actions so naturally after coming face to face with him she's kind of pissed at him,She showed so much promise in the beginning.,"She does what she thinks will benefit most everyone, except when it doesn't benefit *her.*",I think we are seeing the start of Dany the bad guy breaker of chains and burner of families. Will be very interesting to see how this all pans out. Remember all our villains in this show are now most of our favourites only right that a couple of favourites go the other way.,"I have to add that this father she speaks of torchered and killed Jon’s grandfather and uncle. Here she mourns him in front of Jon. 

While...Speaking against the man that stopped her insane father from doing similar to the whole kingdom (or at least most of Kingslanding) as if the only victim here is her murderous father.","I know this isn’t the point of the post... but seriously, does anyone worth mentioning in the story have a living father at this point?!","Some has to kill Dany. I vote Arya, the one person she hasn’t come across yet. Sansa should rule with Tyrion as her hand. Jon Snow like Ned Stark is a good person, but also like poor Ned is not suited for the game of thrones...sort of a dumb dumb. Bran is just fuking weird. Tormond and Giants and Mother’s milk Rock!","Yes, there was a bit of a double standard. But that's the brilliance of the show - you catch yourself taking sides and being tribal,unjustly.","That piss me off too. Dany put Jamie on for killing her father,over looking the fact that her father just killed Ned Stark father, and brother ,and she herself  had executed Sam's father, and brother without so much as a trial.",She's a Mad Queen,Is dany losing her mind just like her dad?,Dany is an asshole and only cares about the iron throne and ruling everyone!,She really isn't.,"dany is an asshole, selfish bitch that was promised","I agree and made a similar comment elsewhere here. To rule on the Iron Throne you need a good and long introduction when you enter a room. Adding ""breaker of chains"" to that introduction really fills out the resume.",I’m not saying she shouldn’t be but the way she treats people who have done the exact same stuff as she has. I think the reactions of the two different characters speak volumes of their personalities and character.,I’m gonna go with a tentative but resounding no. GRRM obviously has some daddy issues.,The Night King...,"No, she isn’t. At least not yet. She’s done a lot of good. She just acts like an entitled little bitch. Burning the Tarlys was unnecessary but it’s not worse than what almost everyone else in the series have done. She could have used her dragons and her armies to reclaim the iron throne as soon as she came to Westeros but she didn’t. She’s not mad, just very autistic about this “rightful heir”-thing.","That's not true at all, if it were she would have come to Westeros and claimed the throne the moment she took control of the Unsullied. Instead, she stayed in Essos for about 5 years, liberating 3 slave cities. 

Then she got to Westeros and instead of killing Cersei and taking the throne, she calls a temporary truce and goes north to save Jon and the North. She has the Unsullied and the Dothraki and [had] three dragons. She could have taken the throne, let the Walkers destroy the North and cleaned up the rest like Cersei is planning on doing. 

Killing the Tarleys is probably the worst thing she's done and she gave them a choice first.

I'm not saying she's perfect, no-one in this story is, but she accepts advice from people who know better, she learns and she grows and she does care about the common people, not just the throne. 

Regarding killing Sam's brother and Dad and Jamie killing her dad, yes it is somewhat hypocritical but there are a lot of differences. The first being, like I said, she gave them a choice. There was no need for Dickon to step up and die with his dad, that was totally his doing. The other being, she grew up with stories of this horrible man that killed her father and what his family did to the rest of her family. She hasn't had Sam's mom and sister raped and smashed against a wall. She's only recently accepted that her dad was actually terrible (but the rest of her family weren't, and they still died in horrible ways) so it would be weird as fuck if she just welcomed Jamie with open arms without mentioning their grim connection.","yeah I guess, Sam went running to Jon for help so that's pretty spot on lol","The thing with how the show is portraying her right now. I have to wonder is some of it them manipulating us into taking a certain perspective in order to ""surprise us"" later with some twist or turn. Are they feints and redirections the directors are putting together. They don't call them ""directors"" for nothing after all. Yes, they are directing the show, but they are also directing the audience in a way...","Does she care about the common people, liberate slaves, etc. because it's right? Or is a strategic political move to help her keep the throne when/if she obtains it?",She needed way more than the unsullied to obtain the throne,"The way I see it, it could go either way. Maybe she devolves into madness or maybe watching the relationships between the Starks and the other Northernes will have her realize that love, friendship, family and loyalty is more important than holding power. That living is about more than titles and the Iron Throne. It’s hard to say because we haven’t seen much of Daenerys personality beyond that as a ruler.","What has liberating slaves in Essos got to do with the Iron Throne? She got her armies, the Unsullied and the Dothraki, by force. Sure, she gave the Unsullied a choice to leave and this was liberating them but she didn't have to do that, she'd already killed their master, she could have just taken them all. 

The Dotharki *took* slaves and they follow her because of her power, they don't care that she does good things.

When Gendry bought the news that the gang were stuck on a rock, did she have to fly North to save them? Not at all, in fact, letting the King in the North and his men die would have made it easier for her to take the North. 

She definitely wants the throne, that's her end goal no doubt, but not everything she does is for that purpose, she has deviated many times.","Like three dragons and a 16,000 Dothraki? And an alliance with High Garden, Dorne and the Iron Born? She didn't make those alliances because she freed slaves, she made those alliances through a mutual hate of Cersei.","Freeing slaves is part of her hype. So is introduced as ""... , breaker of chains, ...""

&#x200B;

Saving the King in the North could be a good way to be popular in the North.","If game of thrones taught me anything.  No alliance is reliable enough for assumption lol.    Boats can sink, disease can spread and god knows what else.  I mean, it looks good on paper.  But the variables are too random!","This would make sense if Westeros was a democracy and voted for their ruler, but they're not. Monarchs take or inherit thrones. She's not going to spend 5 years liberating slaves in a land Westerosies don't care about for a few extra brownie points with people who have no say over who sits on the throne. 

And again, saving the King in the North might make her slightly more popular with the Northerners, but it's a huge gamble for a small pay off, she lost one of her children and how has it turned out for her? They don't like her. She didn't risk all that for favours.","Plus she liked Jon which is only one of the reason why she decided to save him, the other is that she needed Jon to get the  North on her side.",Yeah that kinda went tits up huh xD,It isnt a democracy but a loved king can reign better than a hated king and his decisions will be more likely accepted by other lords and the citizens,I agree going to save them was a bad move. She should have had the Iron Throne by force already and wrapped this thing up in Season 7. But then again I am looking forward to Season 8 :),Lol yup!,I don't disagree but unfortunately love isn't the way to win a crown you didn't inherit in this world (otherwise Renly would be king!) and I think that all that effort she put into Essos has very little to do with her getting the Iron Throne. The love she may receive from lords and citizens is just sort of a bonus (but she hasn't actually got any of that love! They just see a foreign Queen! That's what I mean that the risk was far greater than the almost none existent reward),"He describes pretty good what i mean

https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bham5g/dead_dads/elrjyo8?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",I like this theory,"As far as I understand it, not just any person can become a 3ER. Bloodraven had been reaching out to people for years, in hopes that one would have the ability to become the next 3ER, and Bran was the one who had the ability to do so.","I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

- [/r/u_avalanchewrit] [Have a read and tell me what you think.](https://www.reddit.com/r/u_avalanchewrit/comments/bh9lkb/have_a_read_and_tell_me_what_you_think/)

&nbsp;*^(If you follow any of the above links, please respect the rules of reddit and don't vote in the other threads.) ^\([Info](/r/TotesMessenger) ^/ ^[Contact](/message/compose?to=/r/TotesMessenger))*","But Tyrion sat down to chat with Bran, and Tyrion has the most POV in the story. Doesn’t it make more sense that Bran started the “transfer process” with Tyrion and his “big brain”, not Sam?","Isn’t part of being the three eyed raven also that he is a worg or have I misunderstood that. Both Night King and bran have the same powers, both can worg both can see past and future I feel a battle between the two of them will take place in the minds of the two rather than on a battlefield",I also have a theory. I think this next episode will result in a massive lose for the living leaving only a few of the main characters alive one of them being Bran. Bran then has to somehow travel back in time using his powers obviously and worg into one of the characters present at the time of the night kings creation. Trying to convince the children of the Forrest that it’s a bad idea,"Well. I like the theory that Tyrion is GRRM. He has had contact with almost every character or at least third hand knows their story. He sat down with Bran for a while. What was the purpose of that scene? If memories are to go forward, the Song of Ice and Fire must be written. I think Tyrion is the candidate and I also think that means he survives Winterfell tonight to carry Bran’s story forward. That would mean he also knows about Jon being a Targaryen and how the last Night King was killed.",Can I get a share? :3,Desparate times?,"I'd watch that video I posted. Bloodraven needed to find someone with magical abilities,  from a magical bloodline, which is why Bran become the next 3ER.","I still don't believe that's how that works. 

Here's a video that talks about it:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oEqnDAbCfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oEqnDAbCfE) 

Skip to 16:40 in the video. In the 1st book, the 3ER had been trying to reach out to others to have them ""wake"" their magic, so that they could hopefully become the next 3ER. As mentioned in the video, numerous people failed. Bran was successful, which is why he became the next 3ER.","I can meet you halfway there, so let's see now, he still has the mark, so it's either the NK dies or someone who cannot be tracked gets the powers. Sound?","I don't see D&D completely disregarding the lore of the books by having Bran give his powers to someone such as Sam, who has never shown any magical abilities whatsoever, and whose family doesn't come from a magical bloodline (Ii'm not 100% positive on the bloodline).

I think the NK will be neutralized one way or another, ie he's killed or a pact of some kind is made that gets the WWs to go back north (I think it's the former and not the latter).","I've never had a problem with recaps, but being fullscreen is always glitchy for me. I've sent in a couple of reports, hopefully they fix it soon so we can watch the last season in peace.",On hbo go you press down and the next episode will be there to choose. May be the same on hbo now?,Just stop watching when it gets to the recap?,Anytime I try to watch it it lags really bad.,"Sure, but since I’m binge watching, what I’m trying to do is get to the next episode without all the hurdles. It’s quite strange to me that there isn’t simply a next episode option anywhere and that the autoplay doesn’t go there either.",I see I see. Yeah I agree it's annoying for binge watching purposes. NOW doesn't have the greatest format.,Does the next episode link pop up on the bottom right if you hover over the play button? I still have to click it and put it up to full screen (and scroll through to the beginning of the episode...)

I’m not in any way trying to say that you couldn’t easily wrap the story up and make it seem to yourself that it makes sense. The thing is that the distribution of time and overall emphasis were illogical. The writers should’ve been aware that e.g. having the Long Night play out somewhere mid-season would completely undermine its impact on the story. In addition to that, I think that Drogon destroying King’s Landing took approximately the same amount of time and it wasn’t even that necessary. Now I’m just speaking my mind and I’m not saying that my opinion is necessarily correct, but in my view - showing off all the CGI was a tactical move for the writers to lessen their own workload.\nCreating art is always a two-way street and the reception plays an important role just like the creation itself.\nI loved these characters like they were my own but in the end I felt nothing. Is it because I have no sense of logic and deduction? Perhaps, but I doubt it. It simply didn’t feel natural enough for a cathartic reaction that we had all expected. Hence the discontent, hence the outcry.']}","{'eq4vpqh': [1, 'Dany grew up fleeing from people that would have brutally murdered her.  She was a tool and a pawn, and sold off to Drogo, where she learned to be ruthless and speak with authority.  The Dothraki didn’t listen to her until she asserted dominance over them.  And when they all abandoned her because Drogo was injured, she was told it was because they followed power.  The slaver that she bought the Unsullied from didn’t take her seriously because she was a woman.  Nor did the slavers in Mereen, or the Khalasar.  In each instance she only came out on top because she asserted every ounce of dominance she had.\n\nThe seven kingdoms was an entirely different culture.  Power isn’t given to the strongest there, it’s given to those who call in favors.  Where Dany was from, executing prisoners quickly was a gift, because the alternative was slavery or torture.  Nothing she did before burning King’s Landing indicated madness, she was just following the customs she’d been taught.  In her experience, showing mercy had always caused problems later.  Executing the Tarly’s was not out of the ordinary by any means.  \n\nThe sparks of madness only appeared in late last season, when she met Jon, where she let her jealousy take hold.  That was disappointing because we are to believe that it was because Jon leaving her, when the relationship was so rushed it wasn’t at all believable.\n\nI don’t mind the Tyrion/ chair scene, because as you said, it shows his eagerness to be serious and do everything right, which was then completely destroyed by the humorless-sitcom like banter about the practicality of whore houses.\n\nThe scene with Bronn confronting Jaime and Tyrion had no value whatsoever to the plot.  It wouldn’t have been weird to see him next in the council room.  That time could have been so much better spent by showing Dany’s sanity crumbling, or Jaime oscillating between Briene and Cersi, or Jon and Dany interacting, or Sanasa and Arya’s reaction to learning Jon was never their brother.

His only emotions were self righteousness and jealousy, just as Dany was in the end.  It was all very “the ends justify the means” for both of them.  I think if Viserys has always been as unstable as he was he died, he couldn’t possibly made it as far as he did.\n\nIf we hadn’t seen Dany’s character develop so much over 8 seasons, she also would have been a very one dimensional villain.  Many people are upset that Dany’s character arc was destroyed by how she ended up, but I think her insanity was inevitable and that the actress behaving just as Viserys had brought her arc to a satisfying close.  I wish there had been more progression, instead of just flipping a switch from “sane” to “insane”.  When I first heard the “mad queen” theories I wanted it to not be true, because I *did* like Dany’s character so much, but now that I’ve seen the ending I can’t imagine it ending any other way.\n\nI would argue that Ramsay was also insane.

How do you deal with ramifications of the NK being defeated if NK death is last episode. You\'re basically asking for another season if youre insisting in NK\'s defeat being last episode. \n\nDrogon destroying King\'s Landing was to make Dany\'s decision to turn heel more acceptable. We had been shielded from seeing Dany\'s victims perspective, hence why a large number of people didnt think it was believable, but she randomly crucified 100 slavers, pulled a pretty Lannister-y double-cross when she ""trades"" Drogon for the Unsullied, or when she chose to kill random sons of mereen. She has shown a tendency to think in black-white terms, and it was  frequently the counsel of more level-headed characters that allowed her to see more shades of gray. And her obsession with everyone bending the knee was developed in parallel with her falling in love with Jon Snow. This did not happen over the course of 3 episodes, but we were distracted with Jonarys when it was happening. \n\nWhen Mad Queen first happened, i thought it was underdeveloped, but i thought it was pretty clear in next episode when they showed the courtyard full of Dothraki/Unsullied, that she had rightly inferred that she lacked the political support in Westeros to accomplish the regime change she envisioned, and she resorted to the same approach she always had: bend the knee or die.  So part of it was an emotional outburst/rage, but i think a big part of it was cold political calculation. Her typical approach of play savior, have everyone love you, be given free reign to dictate terms clearly failed this time around due to popularity of jon snow, arya. I personally think the emotional instability part of losing Jorah/Missandei weakened the character arc, or at best distracted from the truer motivation. It has creeped me the fuck out since she first started calling the dragons her children. The Starks have as close a relationship with their direwolves as Dany does with her dragons, and not one of them refers to them as their children/siblings. Dany has always inspired mixed feelings in me. As has Arya to be honest, but she sorted it out, Dany didnt. Each character has a number of other characters you can try to draw parallels with, and you come away with interesting observations of those characters. I think Dany comparing to Stannis for ""I deserve the throne"" and Arya for ""vengeance is mine,"" tyrion/varys for ""we can make a better world,"" and the Lannisters/Tyrells/anyone in Westeros for ""politics are always cutthroat,"" give the fullest picture of her. Like Stannis, her belief in her destiny drove her to commit pretty terrible atrocities. Her desire for vengeance was less consuming than arya\'s, and indeed, arya was the more death-obsessed one until she reunites with her family, achieves broad recognition as savior of westeros, two things Dany is denied _despite_ having contributed far more to the war effort. Hell, i subscribe to the Dany was a victim of Sansa\'s/the North\'s distrust as much as her own internal characteristics. I dont believe Dany goes Mad Queen if anyone in Westeros shows her a modicum of appreciation for saving everyone\'s asses, the people of Westeros _are_ different than those in Essos, and i think that plays a huge role. Ultimately, it\'s her sense of entitlement- a trait best demonstrated by cersei- that leads her to burn down king\'s landing the way that cersei blows up the sept. Like Cersei, she vowed numerous times to destroy anyone that got in the way of her attaining power. The difference is the Lannisters have insight into the fact they are selfinterested elitist assholes- and paradoxically- this awareness redeems their psychological state. But Dany isnt really a monster, is she? She has a compassion for the common person that Cersei distinctly lacks, and her inability to balance her ruthless ambition with her kind heart is why she gets twisted. She needs to be a good person in her own eyes (while Lannisters have numerous times described themselves as monsters), and so she develops what is ultimately a shallow rationalization that she is doing what she\'s doing to ""save everyone."" This lie she believes herself is why she is both a genuinely kind person and also a horrible monster. \n\nThe reason Dany as a villain works is because the viewer also believes in her pre-ordained destiny as savior, accomplished almost entirely by the music that plays whenever she was destroying her enemies. Dany is an amazing character, far from thinking her character arc was ruined by season 8, i think she\'s one of the most complex female characters ever written. \n\n\nAnyway, despite everything, i am mostly sympathetic to the complaints people have, it\'s just that those things didnt keep me from loving it. Ive rewatched season 8 episodes at a much higher rate than i have prior seasons, i honestly loved it\n\n\nIm sorry you felt nothing. I cried for Cersei/Jamie, Jon having to kill Dany, the Hound dadding Arya. And full blown wept for Theon, Jorah, Lyanna. I wept for Brienne preserving Jamie\'s legacy. These are all complex, flawed characters, and attempts to ""find a moral""/ message are doomed to be unsatisfying.  I am more than okay connecting the dots myself, the fans have demonstrated for more than 8 years ability to generate hypotheses/theories that are frankly as entertaining as the show itself. I dont know why suddenly we as a community have lost that ability entirely; we could piece together Mad Queen was going to happen, R+ L = J, but we cant fathom that Euron was hiding behind a fucking tall cliff. \n\nThere are lots of loose ends, and Dany\'s saga is over, but like, you know theyre making more spinoff shows, books, you dont think theyre going to be addressed?']}",{},{},"{'epbcf5l': [1, ""That might be true.

But what I’m pointing my finger at is the fact that this season turned into all-action when the rest of the show focused more on premeditation and the circumstances that drove certain characters to do what they thought was right or necessary. The second episode of the season was, to my mind, the last that featured any nicely executed dialogue which used to be abundant in the beginning of the show. I loved the point of view when Drogon burned down King’s Landing, I simply thought it to be unnecessary to take up so much time, especially when there could’ve been many other scenes that would’ve kept the storyline going by showing some characters’ lucid thoughts. If it weren’t for beautiful shots and incredible acting, most of the scenes that weren’t completely action-related would’ve been too cringey to even watch. \nHeck, they even had to use devices as old as time to give out a sense of finished story, including Tyrion (almost) breaking the fourth wall whilst talking to Jon, Samwell and ASOIAF and that awkward time-skip during which everything got magically wrapped up and fixed.  \nYeah, Dany always had a unique sense of justice, but it still is too huge a leap even for her to snap and kill the innocents after losing a good portion of her army to defend them just because she didn’t feel loved. I’m not saying it’s not enough of a motivation - it damn sure is - but it would’ve made more sense if those who actually took part in it were primarily affected, not the random innocents. I hoped to see her try to reign justly but face obstacles every step of the way because, let’s face it, peace doesn’t last (as Olenna perfectly said it in her soliloquy) and the people of Westeros would always see her as a foreign invader. That would’ve been a valid turning point for her since they would no longer be so innocent in her eyes. So much of it was left out that would’ve made the show beautiful and relatable on many levels when it comes to contemporary history. \nEach family represented a certain point of view, and their views were portrayed in that manner that however foregrounded, they had to be modified because they no longer proved to work. Some individual stories had a happy ending, some didn’t, just like it was meant to happen, but the simplicity which prevailed made me not buy it. Otherwise the philosophy, though cynical and nihilist, is pretty simple - cross the line, evolve and ascend, stay blindsided by your beliefs and they’ll crumble upon you. \nAlso, we as a community would be able to fathom Euron’s fleet ambushing and taking down Rhaegal if it hadn’t been till last season that we were even faced with the mortality of fully grown dragons. Yeah, they’re not indestructible, they do get hurt, but the only time before that that a dragon was actually killed with one perfect shot was when the NK took Viserion down. But that was different, we had to consider all the magic going around the NK and White Walkers and his supernatural strength. And there wasn’t one time that Euron (only speaking about the show Euron, I’m aware of all the differences in the book) was actually portrayed as someone with that kind of aptitude. Of course, we can say that anything should be expected (this is a dragon show ffs), but that particular act doesn’t exactly follow any principle of coherence, IMO. \nWe could go on pointing out the plot holes which were numerous, making jokes about Tyrion’s cock references and memes about Starbucks cups, but when the dust has settled, we will all eventually come to terms with the show the way it is and hopefully continue to address the main ideas and motifs that were the ones to make it great in the first place.']}","{'epdrvuh': [1, ""Hell no.

The Hound tells them to give him their wine as well.  \n>  \n>Beric, Arya, & the Hound sail across the God’s Eye to the Isle of Faces in the center of the lake. When they reach the island, the Hound and Beric Light the way with their swords through the trees.  \n>  \n>Arya can sense they are not alone on the island. Something is watching them from the shadows.  \n>  \n>Arya finds Jon’s corpse. She rushes toward him. He’s cold as ice. She cries.  \n>  \n>Ser Beric looks at the Hound. “Bring him back, Clegane.”  \n>  \n>“Arya looks up at the Hound. “Sandor, please. Help him.”  \n>  \n>The Hound drains all the wine in his bota bag and kneels over Jon’s body. He holds his hands over Jon’s heart and begrudgingly performs the Last Kiss, breathing life back into Jon Snow.  \n>  \n>Jon gasps as he awakens (again).  \n>  \n>Ser Beric laughs. “You’re getting good at that Clegane.”  \n>  \n>The Hound wipes his mouth. “Fuck the Lord of Light.”  \n>  \n>Arya holds Jon as he struggles to comprehend where he is and what’s happened. (You got killed again for being too noble, you dumb asshole).  \n>  \n>“Arya... Wait... Where’s... Where’s Dany?”  \n>  \n>“She killed you,” says Arya.  \n>  \n>Jon tries to stand but he can’t. (Relax guy, you were just murdered for the second time).  \n>  \n>They make camp on the island to give Jon time to recover from his wounds. Arya, Beric, The Hound, & Jon huddle around a fire.  \n>  \n>“Dany is Azor Ahai,” says Jon. “She stabbed me through the heart to forge the sword Lightbringer in blood. She’s the one that the prophecies promised.”  \n>  \n>“Perhaps she’s not the only one,” says Ser Beric.  \n>  \n>Jon shakes his head. “It’s not me, Beric. It never was.”  \n>  \n>“The Lord of Light brought you back again, didn’t he? Just like he brought me back over and over. There must be a reason.”  \n>  \n>“I’m not Azor Ahai! Hell! Daenerys took Longclaw. I don’t even have a sword.”  \n>  \n>“Yes you do,” says Ser Beric. The fire engulfing his sword goes out. He steps forward and offers the blade to Jon. “May she be like lightning in your hands.”  \n>  \n>Jon looks confused. Arya helps Jon rise to his feet to accept the sword. He clutches his chest in pain.  \n>  \n>Beric gets down on his knees and peels apart his tunic, exposing his scarred bare chest.  \n>  \n>“You want me to kill you?”  \n>  \n>“Why not? You’d be doing me a favor. Time and time again, the Lord has brought me back, and every time I become less and less of the man I was. You can be the light to end the darkness, Jon Snow. The Lord of Light commands it.”  \n>  \n>“You and your goddamn Lord of Light,” says the Hound. “If you do this, Beric, I won’t bring you back.”  \n>  \n>“No, Clegane. I don’t plan to come back this time. Let me die a meaningful death.”  \n>  \n>Jon hesitates. “I can’t.”  \n>  \n>Beric’s not joking. He grabs the sword in Jon’s hands and puts the tip against his sternum. “Please Jon. You’re not killing Beric Dondarrion, just his scarecrow. Do it. For Westeros.”  \n>  \n>The last words appeal to Jon’s unflinching duty to protect the Seven Kingdoms. Jon howls and plunges the sword through Beric’s chest, forging it in blood. Beric dies with a smile on his face.  \n>  \n>When Jon pulls the sword out of Beric, he discovers it glows fiery red. The steel erupts in flames in Jon’s grip.  \n>  \n>(THAT’S RIGHT! THERE ARE 2 AZOR AHAIS. That’s 2 more than what we got this season).  \n>  \n>Jon, Arya, and the Hound cross the lake and disembark the fishing boat. The Hound and Jon use their swords to light the boat on fire holding Beric’s body. His floating pyre drifts off into the God’s Eye as everyone reclaims their horses. They ride east to rendezvous with Ser Davos, Tormund, and their armies as they camp before the march on King’s Landing.  \n>  \n>Ser Davos and the Northerners bend the knee before Jon Snow, Aegon Targaeryan, Azor Ahai, The Lord of Light. Ser Davos slaps Jon on the shoulder, “You are everything I ever hoped Stanis Baratheon would become.”  \n>  \n>Tormund greets Jon with a hug. “Snow. Stark. Targaeryan. Ahai. I don’t know what to call you!”  \n>  \n>“Jon will do.”  \n>  \n>It’s been days since any of the Iron Born saw Euron, and it’s starting to stink. They’re sailing east aimlessly back toward King’s Landing. Cersei finally exits Euron’s Captain’s quarters, dragging Missendei in chains. A huddle of Iron Born await her, asking what happened to Euron, demanding answers. She pulls a Captain Phillips and tells them “Look at me... I am the Captain now.” This doesn’t go over well, and a few of the Iron Born loyal to Euron charge Cersei. The Mountain cuts them all in half. That smoothes things over pretty quick.  \n>  \n>The remaining crew bends the knee. Cersei relishes their submission. Her crew asks, “Where do we set sail?”  \n>  \n>“Bravos. The dead may have no use for all the gold in King’s Landing, but the Iron Bank does.”  \n>  \n>Cersei smiles when the men set about obeying her orders. At last, she’s back in control (She thinks).  \n>  \n>We hear the roar of a dragon in the night. (Oh shit). Cersei turns to see Missendei staring off at the horizon.  \n>  \n>Missendei smiles and whispers a single word under her breath. “Dracarys.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bshj4g/spoilers_very_long_and_detailed_fan_rewrite_of/)\n\n[E5 Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bshj4g/spoilers_very_long_and_detailed_fan_rewrite_of/eonac0p?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\n[E5 Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bshj4g/spoilers_very_long_and_detailed_fan_rewrite_of/eonaght?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\n\n[E5 Conclusion & E6](https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bshj4g/spoilers_very_long_and_detailed_fan_rewrite_of/eonahhc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)'], 'eouupc7': [1, 'This is supposedly better.\n\nlol']}","{'eonkqaf': [0, ""If you can't take more than two seconds to respond with criticism, then maybe you shouldn't respond at all... ~~there are other subreddits more suited to your style.~~""]}",{},"{'eouuodd': [1, 'Uh huh.']}","{'eonaght': [1, '# Episode 5 Continued\n\n>Drogon and Rhaegal dive bomb the Iron Fleet and LIGHT SHIT UP!  \n>  \n>Cersei has nowhere left to run. She takes shelter behind the Mountain as the masts catch on fire.  \n>  \n>Meanwhile, Daenerys is riding Drogon, shouting “Dracarys” until she’s hoarse in the throat. Her dragons absolutely decimate the Iron Fleet.  \n>  \n>The Mountain is exploded off the goddamn flagship. Cersei watches the juggernaut cartwheel into the water. (Now she KNOWS she’s fucked.)  \n>  \n>Missendei seizes the opportunity to jump overboard. Daenerys sees her friend make the leap of faith.  \n>  \n>The Mother of Dragons commands Rhaegal to swoop down close to the ship to scoop up Missandei out of the water. Rhaegal obeys and Missandei is saved.  \n>  \n>Then BAM a scorpion bolt sails right through Rhaegal’s neck. The dragon still spews blood and falls (with Missendei) into the sea and disappears. (OH SHIT!)  \n>  \n>The Mother of Dragons is horrified as she watches one of her children disappear underwater, dragging with it her most trusted advisor.  \n>  \n>She looks to see who fired the shot and sees Cersei behind the Scorpion. (Bitch, no you didn’t!)  \n>  \n>Cersei: Bitch. Yes I did.  \n>  \n>Daenerys charges Cersei head on. Both women scream at each other.  \n>  \n>Blue fire breaks up the fight as the Night King swoops down on Viserion, sending Drogon veering off course. Cersei throws herself off the boat and splashes into the sea before Euron’s flagship, Silence, explodes in blue flames.  \n>  \n>Daenerys and the Night King begin a dance with their dragons.  \n>  \n>Tyrion is watching the whole battle go down from a distance as his boat sails from Dragonstone to King’s Landing with Bronn and Greyworm and more Unsullied to meet up with the Northern/Wildlings/Dothraki.  \n>  \n>Tyrion is welcomed on the shore by Jon Snow, holding a flaming sword. Arya and the Hound stand with him. Tryrion is shocked to see Jon alive and still leading the United northern and Dothraki and Unsullied and Wilding armies under Daenerys’ banner.  \n>  \n>Jon says. “I do not fight for Daenerys. I fight for the living.”  \n>  \n>Bran watches the dragons fight from the balcony of Dragonstone, but he’s omniscient and knows the real hype is all about CLEGANEBOWL (four air horns sound in the distance).  \n>  \n>The Mountain rescues Cersei in the water and helps her swim toward the shore on his back. When they wash up on the beaches below King’s Landing. Arya and Sandor Clegane wait for them.  \n>  \n>Sandor draws his sword. He tells Arya, “Stay back. You can have Cersei once I’m through.”  \n>  \n>CLEGANEBOWL commences. Four air horns sound. The Hound’s sword—Lights—On—Fire! He raises his flaming sword up against his big brother, who still stands knee deep in the surf, guarding Cersei on her knees. Cersei is still choking up water when Sandor attacks, slowly chipping away at his brother’s armor to reveal the monster he’s become.  \n>  \n>“Yeah. That’s you. That’s who you’ve always been.”  \n>  \n>The Hound rushes the Mountain and their swords clash.  \n>  \n>Daenerys chases after the Night King’s dragon. Drogon can outmaneuver Viserion, but the Night King plays dirty and chucks an ice spear that nearly takes off Dany’s head. Daenerys slides off her dragon and free falls over King’s Landing before Drogon catches her on his back.  \n>  \n>The dragons get tangled, snapping and lashing, plummeting to the ground.  \n>  \n>Meanwhile, Jon leads the free armies against the dead at the gates of King’s Landing, wielding a flaming sword. Ser Davos is at his left. Tormund is at his right. Tyrion watches the charge from a safe distance.  \n>  \n>The Northern and Dothraki cavalry charge against the wights, White Walkers, and zombie elephants outside the gates of King’s Landing.  \n>  \n>Greyworm takes down an elephant with his spear. (That still only counts as one).  \n>  \n>Tormund kills the White Walker leader of the Golden Company.  \n>  \n>Back to CLEGANEBOWL, the Mountain will NOT go down. Sandor manages to stab his older brother several times through the chest with his flaming sword, but the Mountain is basically fucking invincible. (It makes no logical sense but the HYPE IS REAL) The Mountain choke slams the Hound (straight to hell) into the water, extinguishing his sword. (Somewhere Jim Ross shouts MY GOD HE JUST BROKE THAT MAN IN HALF!) The Mountain grabs Sandor’s sword and snaps it, then stabs Sandor with a shard in the shoulder. Then he starts to drown his little brother. (It’s eerily similar to him forcing his face into the fire).  \n>  \n>Arya sees Cersei crawling away on the beach, but decides to intervene to save Sandor. She rushes forward, pulls that incredible catapult leap move she knows and plants her Valyrian steal dagger in the Mountain’s head.  \n>  \n>The Mountain throws Arya off and pulls the blade out of his own head. Then he starts coming after Arya. (He’s basically Jason Vorhees at this point)  \n>  \n>Arya gets spooked and flees, scrambling up the rock steps to the cliffs of King’s Landing. The Mountain climbs after her.  \n>  \n>The Hound is still spitting up water. He can see that Arya is in mortal peril.  \n>  \n>Drogon hits Viserion with dragon fire.  \n>  \n>The Night King falls off Viserion into the middle of the battle outside the gates of King’s Landing.  \n>  \n>Tyrion watches as Drogon showers the Knight King in flames, roasting him (alive/dead).  \n>  \n>The Night King emerges from the flames unscathed. He smirks up at Daenerys, still immune to dragon fire.  \n>  \n>He isn’t smirking long. Tormund and Jon Snow are running up on Viserion with a flaming sword. Tormund distracts the dragon with a screaming competition as Jon slices the dragon with the blade and the beast SHATTERS right before Tormund gets torched.  \n>  \n>Jon and Tormund share a laugh. They can’t believe they killed a FUCKING dragon.  \n>  \n>The Night King throws a spear that kills Tormund. Jon cries out for his best friend and charges the Night King. They duel.  \n>  \n>Daenerys is stunned to see Jon Snow is alive. It throws her off her A-game. She finds herself watching, not participating. She dismounts her dragon and draws Lightbringer.  \n>  \n>Arya has her back to the cliffs and there’s nowhere left to run. The Mountain is closing in. Arya thrusts out with her sword, needle. The Mountain bends the blade.  \n>  \n>He grabs Arya’s skull and begins to SQUEEZE. (Oh God no! He’s about to gouge out this little girl’s eyeballs).  \n>  \n>That’s when Sandor Fucking Clegane comes barreling forward and tackles his older brother off the cliffs. They fall together. The Mountains head smashes on the rocks below. He doesn’t get up.

Her eyes are bloody, but she can still see.  \n>  \n>Jon is on his back, fighting off the Night King when Daenerys charges into battle, but she’s a novice with a sword. The Night King knocks Lightbringer out of her hands and towers over Daenerys, preparing to kill her. At last, Jon sticks the Night King through the chest with his flaming sword.  \n>  \n>The Night King shatters. The zombie elephants shatter. All the armies of the dead break into ice, leaving King’s Landing a torched ashy ghost town.  \n>  \n>Rather than confront / congratulate Jon, Daenerys gets up and races to Drogon. She takes flight and rides her dragon to be the first to the Red Keep.  \n>  \n>Jon watches her go. He drops his flaming sword. He doesn’t want the throne. He’s never wanted it. He leaves with Ser Davos and all the victorious Northern / Wildlings, while the Unsullied / Dothraki march into King’s Landing after Daenerys.  \n>  \n>Cersei crawls along the beach. Her hands reach out in front of her, grouping at the sand. She touches a pair of boots and looks up. She sees Jaime looking down.  \n>  \n>Cersei cries and reaches up to her brother.

But perhaps Bran sees a greater plan for Jon.  Now the Three-Eyed Raven, who had strong ties to the Children of the Forest, is it possible Bran sent Jon back to the North knowing that he will someday be turned into the next Night\'s King?  Of course this would only be possible if some of the CotF still remain, but it would make sense that the CotF would want to re-introduce another Night\'s King to restore balance and prevent man from consuming what remains of their world.\n\nJon\'s story is already very close to that of the original Night\'s King, being the Lord Commander of the Night\'s Watch and having fallen in love with a queen who\'s skin was (coincidentally) ""as white as the moon"".  Jon, a warrior ""who knows no fear"", closely matches the description of the original Nights King before the Night King was turned.\n\nI think it would make sense that the CotF would devise a plan utilizing perhaps their greatest advantage over men, time.  The CotF live to be hundreds of years old, while any man would be lucky to see a full century - let alone half a century given the average lifespan of the show\'s characters.  Since the CotF live such long lives, perhaps whatever plan they originally put forth when they created the Night King was not expected to finish manifesting for hundreds, or even thousands of years.\n\nIt\'s also not clear whether or not Bran (the Three-Eyed Raven) is actually capable of seeing the future.  In the show Bran experienced many past events, but we never witnessed any future events.  Perhaps this is because Bran actually can\'t see the future, but instead knows the cyclical past.  And because (if) the timeline is truly cyclical, then it follows that Bran\'s ability to see the past also enables him to predict the future.  This would also give Bran an interest in preserving the cyclical timeline by aiding in the creation of the next Night King.\n\nIt would be interesting if amongst all the scheming of men, there was a greater scheme set forth by the CotF to preserve what\'s left of the pre-Westeros world - before the First Men arrived and pillaged their world.\n\nThe theme of cyclicality also seems to be somewhat prominent in the show; the best example being the emphasis on seasons (Winter is coming!).  Much of the history seems to be associated with the seasons, and seasons as we know come and go in cycles.\n\nIt\'s all unlikely this is the intended direction of the writers/author, but it would make for an interesting \'sprequel\', continuing where the story left off while also exploring the origins of the Night\'s King.']}","{'eoci54g': [19, 'Maybe we are suppose to assume that the watchmen respawned, like the dothraki and unsullied in patch 8.5'], 'eocg6ia': [5, ""Not all the watchmen are dead.

Yes, the seeds were definitely there, however, there was also a period where it seemed she had grown past her worst instincts, of domination, and revenge.\n\nI am rewatching the series right now, and given how close we are to recent events, the seeds were planted very well in the early seasons. The problem is that there was also a period of time in the later seasons, let's say from when she fled Meereen on Drogon, to when she arrives in Winterfell with Jon. During this time we see her become a more benevolent leader, someone who appears able to work with others, and work for the greater good. Heck, she comes across as such a genuinely good leader that people in IRL want to name their babies after even.\n\nBut then, all of a sudden, beginning with the Battle of Winterfell, the pendulum swings wildly back again, to where she was emotionally during the period of time between losing her dragons to the warlocks of Qarth, and her struggles attempting to rule Meereen. Again her need to dominate and control take center stage. But the problem is that we are not shown the motivation, we are asked to simply accept it. To me, this is like a mathematician asking us to accept a scientific theory with no proof. It simply doesn't work.\n\nBefore she fled Meereen, and began her odyssey of transformation, we absolutely saw evidence that she could be cruel and irrational. For example, taking all the heads of the great families of Meereen into the dragon crypt and randomly burning one of them to death for something he may not even have been guilty of.\n\nVulture Online actually has an article that talks about this same topic that you mentioned, and explores it in some detail:  [https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-daenerys-mad-queen-trope.html](https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/game-of-thrones-daenerys-mad-queen-trope.html)""], 'enyymox': [3, ""I've read the opinion that her descent was gradual, she might've either been dissuaded or lost her supporters (except by fear).  \n\nI can understand that pos.

Yes, the straws that finally broke the camel's back came fast and hard in the past few episodes, but that's also by design, since spacing out the losses of her loved ones only gives her more time in between to recover mentally. Losing Jorah, Missandei, Viserion, Rhaegal, the love of Jon all in such quick succession was exactly the catalyst to make her lose her fucking mind. In fact, had they stretched out the tragedy across multiple seasons, not only would her descent be less steep and thus less out of control, but also far more predictable.

This is because the writers have used one device over and over and over, in resolving swordfights, and in two battles. \n\nThe fight would go from bad to worse for the hero(es), until it looks like all is lost, and then the person/army who you\'d been misdirected to forget about, suddenly steps in and saves the day. The did it in Blackwater, in the battle of the Bastards, and in lots of one-on-one swordfights. Arya, the spunky little master assassin was groomed as the one to save the day at the last second by killing the NK, with her little Valyrian Steel dagger: the perfect assassin weapon for any NK who happens to be about...\n\nI guess we could suppose that Sansa liked Littlefinger, but I never saw it that way. When she had to deal with Joffrey, she was an immature child, and Littlefinger was the only one she could (naively) look to as a protector. After marriage to Ramsay Bolton, she grew up fast, and saw Littlefinger as someone who could teach her to read and manipulate people, which could really protect her. I don\'t think she ever liked Littlefinger, but she now has a lot of him in her.\n\nTyrion is smart, but he can\'t read minds, though I suspect he\'s fooled himself into thinking he could, or at least judge people\'s motives better than he reasonably could. His string of bad decisions leads to a crisis of confidence, which will play out in his arc. \n\nThe conversation with Varys was particularly interesting. I\'ve seen the plot device used many times in other stories, and the one who advocates rebellion (Varys) tends to chicken out, while the one who adamantly insists on remaining loyal tends to be the one who makes a painful, snap-decision to turn on their leader, in a moment of crisis. I\'ve mentioned this elsewhere here too: it was done beautifully in ""The Caine Mutiny,"" and lots of other places. I strongly suspect that Tyrion will turn on Dany, as the Mad Queen really emerges.\n\nDany has gone through a long series of successes, tempered with smaller setbacks, until she arrived in Westeros with an unstoppable force. She\'s had no doubt that she\'d win it all. Now, it\'s starting to fall apart. Her claim to the throne has been shaken. Ep 3 has decimated her armies. Ep 4 has shown that her dragons are not as invincible as she\'d assumed. Her faith has been severely shaken, and I expect it to continue in Ep 5. if I\'m right, she\'ll eventually crack.\n\nI agree with you on Bran... his full purpose seemed to be to reassure Jaime, and to render Theon comfortable and happy to die...'], 'en6eh8c': [2, 'You are so right, since arriving in Westeros Daenerys is not the same character.

This show, and the books, are based on the internecine struggles of a global superpower in the late middle ages. These were some of the most advanced military minds, some of the greatest tacticians in history. And yet Daenerys has no guards or lookouts manning the near approach to Dragonstone to warn her in case of an attack?\n\nIf it was just one mistake like this then I could excuse it, but its not, its just a series of really stupid tactical errors that no global power could be given the latitude to make, because they would be driven from power if they did.']}",{},"{'en4qpqg': [3, 'Could be, could be.']}","{'en4qz3q': [0, ""That makes sense...

Because Dany had a lot of other stuff goin\' on at the time, we may not have paid it a lot of attention.\n\nDany\'s come a long way since she could legitimately call herself ""Breaker of Chains."" There was a time when she cared about freeing subjugated peoples, and they loved her for it. The masses crowded behind her, and she\'s picked up something that to some of us approaches a god-complex.\n\nShe\'s developed into a proud, self-entitled brat, who thinks that a kingdom simply belongs to her, though the people in her ""kingdom"" would beg to differ. The people she\'s encountered in Westeros don\'t need their chains broken; they were already free. In fact, as far as they\'re concerned, this foreign b#$%h has come to put chains on them, by imposing herself on them as a queen they never wanted. She has become to the people of Westeros the exact opposite of what she once was in Essos.\n\nShe continually whines that these people don\'t like her, as she\'s too naive to understand that she earned the people\'s admiration in Essos, but is doing everything possible to drive these new folks away.\n\nOne of her more pathetic moments was her patting herself on the back for her kind act to Gendry, thinking she actually knew how to deal with these new people. It was an echo of her ""Breaker of Chains"" days, but there aren\'t that many chains to be broken in this new land. She was dismayed to see her act almost immediately forgotten as so many people expressed their loyalty to Jon, who also doesn\'t know how to deal with these people, but he naturally came by it, in the same way Dany naturally came by being able to deal with the people of Essos.\n\nJon and Dany are mirror images, in some ways. Each is a natural leader of crowds of people who are also mirror images of one another. Thing is, Jon is in his element; Dany is a fish out of water.\n\nDany has no feel for military strategy, so her lack of it needn\'t surprise us. In some ways, she\'s as naive as Sansa was, in her pre-Bolton days. (I\'d suspect that Sansa recognizes her naivete, and despises her for it...) She\'s stumbled on the ways to lead one people, her dragons gave her brute-force power when she needed it, and that\'s sufficed, up \\`till now.

The motivations are missing, the moments of reflection and self-awareness, its all wrong. \n\nI would have preferred the story arc of her and Jon to be more passionate, more shakespearean, but alas that was not to be. What they had/have was very shallow. Which is really sad to me, because they are both anointed with sacred magic, Jon being raised from death, and Daenerys. I understand that the Weiss and Benioff want us to believe that Dany loves Jon, but I don't see it. And I don't know what they wanted us to think about Jon's feelings for her. \n\nFor me, the greatest of all endings to their story arc would have been if they left this plane of existence together, sacrificing themselves for each other, and for Westeros. And moving on together to a new realm, either as night king and queen, or some other place beyond the realm of the living. As things stand now, I cannot see anything other than a very conventional ending to this story. This is what saddens me the most, it was building towards something Wagnerian, something Tolkien, and the wind just kind of collapsed out of the sails. \n\n<-- all of this is just my little opinion of course, I know people who find the series to be very compelling in its final season.

The YouTube clip will be helpful in this. If you\'ll compare it to the scorpion Euron used in ep 4, you may notice that they\'re not the same weapons at all. The one Bronn used was aimed by hand, and was a little over half the size of Euron\'s, which needed a team of people to aim it, while Euron simply sat in an attached seat and fired the weapon.\n\nBronn\'s weapon was only partially effective. It wounded the dragon, but was destroyed when Dany attacked it. Euron\'s weapon was lethal to the dragon, and Dany couldn\'t get close enough to counterattack. Curiously, I think that once Euron fired his bolt and missed was the one chance Dany had to crisp him, before the weapon could be reloaded. She missed her chance. Not sure, though.\n\nNow, even the limited effectiveness of Bronn\'s weapon should have had everyone wary that the age of using dragons as an unstoppable weapon was about to close. But Dany didn\'t do it, and from everyone\'s reaction to ep 4, the audience didn\'t, either. Qyburn updated his scorpion, and Dany\'s remaining dragon is all but neutralized, now. Perhaps Dany will die in one final game-of-chicken, in which she and Euron kill one another.\n\nDany should have recognized from Bronn\'s weapon that the game had changed radically. Since most of the audience missed that too, perhaps we can\'t be too hard on her. If all of her dragon experience was that of invincibility, she might become blind to the fact that she was suddenly very vulnerable.\n\n> Any keep or castle, regardless of where it sat, if it was occupied, would be protected and guarded. It doesn\'t matter if its on the sea or not... To leave it unattended would be to invite exactly this type of disaster. \n\nI can see where you\'re coming from, but I\'m not sure this would have made any difference. Again, they were attacked by sea, so any attendants, if they were guarding the island, may or may not have been aware that there were extra ships where they shouldn\'t be. If they did, these people seem to lack any kind of signalling mechanism to alert someone in the air, and even if they could do that, it comes back to the fact that they weren\'t expecting a dragon-killer weapon. So even if they saw it, that unexpected extra fleet would have been seen as inconsequential: to be investigated and possibly destroyed at their convenience.\n\nThe lethal upgraded scorpion changed everything.']}","{'en5bb44': [1, 'I don\'t buy that this was ""a new type of weapon they had no idea existed""... the similarities between what she faced in S7, and what Euron used against her far outweigh the differences.

The books and show are largely based upon military and intelligence practices that were in use during the late middle ages. What we are talking about here is defense 101.

I really don\'t know the answer to that question. But I do know that no amount of arguing that the scene follows any kind of understandable logic is going to convince me. \n\nThere is one argument that makes sense, but unfortunately Benioff and Weiss cannot use it. In the books, Euron is equipped with dark magic, including a dragon horn that is used to control the behavior of dragons. But book Euron is much different than series Euron, so D&D can\'t use that argument.']}","{'en5ovb1': [1, 'All your points are well taken, and there\'s much there to consider.

And in fact, Benioff said it in the BTS interview, ""she just kind of forgot about it..."" LOL\n\nNo prob; I wasn\'t trying to sell anything. To explain my point, let\'s start with the fact that Dany is not, and will probably never be, a military tactician. Her successes have been based on inspiring loyalty from the commonfolk, having lots of luck, and having dragons. That\'s all. She\'s developed something close to a god-complex, and is absolutely sure she\'s bound for glorious victories.\n\nI was also amused by Benioff\'s ""she just kind of forgot about it,"" but I know from experience that an idle answer in an interview can come across as other than you wanted. While it\'s possible he truly meant that she forgot, I rejected the goofy-interpretation and saw it as Dany\'s willful-forgetfulness: a denial that she could possibly lose. (I could be wrong...)\n\nAnd speaking of interpretation, we probably don\'t need to over-parse what I was saying, either. Dany, again, is not a military tactician, and did not recognize a real threat, because it didn\'t have real consequences. The V2.0 scorpion was a total game changer, and Dany doesn\'t seem to have had any idea it was coming or might be coming. Since the audience has, by and large, reacted the same way, I\'m not surprised that Dany overlooked the obvious. Many of us did not.\n\n>You wouldn\'t be in power if you didn\'t have these basic measures in place, because lawlessness and chaos was so prevalent that to leave yourself exposed in that way would mean you\'d lost whatever it is you had to protect. \n\nThis is largely true, but we can\'t make a law out of it. Dany\'s power came from luck, admiration, and dragons, period. Dany\'s troubles come from the fact that she\'s not as lucky in Westeros, almost no one admires her in Westeros, and they figure out how to kill dragons in Westeros. (And she\'s lost a huge chunk of her army in an unplanned-for fight.) As a result, your statement is coming true, just a little later than you were expecting. Dany\'s power is collapsing, and the last two episodes may finally start showing some real story...\n\n> Why they would have chosen to go this route is anyone\'s guess. \n\nSince I qualify as an ""anyone,"" I\'m guessing that they just want to wrap up the story and do something else.

She did it because it was right and even if Sansa wants the North to be independent doesn’t mean she gets to be a bitch and go against Jon’s word to Daenerys. Cuz really he was named King of the North and he bent the knee to save the North and all mankind really. Sansa has always been jealous that he would be warden and then they also named him King of the North, because she has always wanted to rule. She’s not just being protective of Jon she is really protecting her rule. She doesn’t want to lose her power she has gotten. She craves it now. \n\nYes she learned a lot but she is using the same tricks she despised about them. Her gut feeling is that there is another women trying to impose on her power she has over the North. Not saying she doesn’t care about Jon or the North but she wants the power. That’s why she didn’t keep Jon’s secret. She knew that it would spread. She took time to see how it would benefit herself like Little finger and Cersei would have done and then blabbed. She is becoming like those in the capital her family never wanted to be like. And for what Daenerys did for Gendry, sure it may have been manipulative to an extent, but really it was a strategical. That’s what you do when giving out titles as a Queen or King. You want allies.\n\nI mean really the Throne is up for grabs, I guess, but from how it works in the GoT world it is hers and she wants to take it back. I mean she started out wanting it for the right reason, but her journey and especially recently has been pretty messed up. I mean I can understand why she’s losing it but now is the time she has the choice to have it affect her so negatively that she becomes the Mad Queen or not. Which she prob will go full Targaryen or if not will end up dying. But Sansa didn’t know any of that. Now the fact Arya said something to Jon is what I feel would make it have an impact to at least look at things more weary like for Jon. Arya only ever cared about her family and her and Jon had a deep bond. Sansa always wanted to be a lady and rule. I mean she is great at it, not saying she isn’t, but I also think that’s were her mind is on, just like Daenerys and just like Little Finger and Cersei.

Because he\'s a *Baratheon.* This is the house that took the throne from the Targs. Of course she\'s being manipulative. Not to an extent.

It’s what bitchy girls do, and that’s how Sansa has always been, bitchy. \n\nYes she wants to keep an eye on Gendry as well, who wouldn’t. I don’t think it was manipulation really. Or it was really bad manipulation as any one could see why she gave him the title. One he did totally earn it, but two she wants allies and she wants to make sure she has eyes on him for being the bastard son of the usurper.
