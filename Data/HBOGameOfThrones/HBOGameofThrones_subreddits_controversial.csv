1,741mr8,Jaime Lannister Literally Did NOTHING Wrong,"I'm being dead serious here. All he has ever done was to protect Cersei, his family, or the realm. I don't think I need to convince you at this point that killing the mad king was not only justified, but morally required of Jaime. He saved thousands by doing this. Now you guys may want to criticize him for his relationship with Cersei. But can you truly blame him for it? He can't choose whom he loves. Ask yourselves, if you found out your wife, or girlfriend was actually your sister, would you break up? No! You love her and even something like that won't extinguish your love for her. As for pushing Bran (I can already hear the moral outrage), what would you do in that situation? Bran was very likely to tell his father and his father would tell Robert Baratheon-who would kill Jaime, Cersei, and their kids and force Tywin to have to go to war with the crown. It was one kid vs his own kids and once again, the realm. A lot of people like to say that Jaime recently turned good, but I argue that he always was good.",35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/741mr8/jaime_lannister_literally_did_nothing_wrong/,2017-10-03 20:43:14

8,bo1p0z,[SPOILERS] WHY IS EVERY CASUAL HATING ON DANERYS?,"I don't understand why so many people are hating on dany this episode? Saying she's turned full mad queen, like Cersei's didn't blow up the pope (and hundreds of other innocents) in church? Danerys' rage is totally understandable. It was made clear that no one loves her, Jon doesn't love her. She is aware that everyone fears her. So after the rejection she got from Jon, she literally says fine fear it is. Now think about it, Cersei didn't show dany any mercy, she ordered her dragons to be killed (I have no fucking idea how Rhaegal died like a little bitch - the showrunners are cunts) and ordered the execution of missande, so to Dany it became personal. It wasn't just about reclaiming the 7 kingdoms it was also about destroying all her enemies that have personally attack her. That's why Varys got toasted at the beginning of the episode. I haven't read all the books (in the process of going through them now, but in the show danerys and cersei's characters were supposed to be mirrored, except dany was being put in check by her advisors, and cersei eventually had no one to put her in check. Mind you the way they killed off Cersei and Jamie was fucking pathetic. All the actors are doing fantastic jobs but the fucking writers man. You can definitely tell the show is ahead of the books now.",14,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bo1p0z/spoilers_why_is_every_casual_hating_on_danerys/,2019-05-13 14:21:41

14,3bw8nk,"[All spoilers] My season 6 theory hopefully my theory is welcome here, kept getting removed on the other sub reddit","disclaimer: This theory is heavily influenced by the idea that Mel will bring Jon back to life
 I apologise in advance for spelling errors 
This theory applies to the show and not the books! I
 will later edit in what i think will happen to Danny not really sure what will happen there yet.
 I think there is a chance that part or parts of my theory will be correct but the chances of it being so are slim
 Are we sitting nicely? Well here we go then

Mel resurrects Jon shortly before the Nights Watch are to burn him, after revealing that he is alive, Thorne now LC is shocked - Jon doesn't want anything to do with the Night's watch any more and promises not to take revenge if they release him from his vows, they do and davos, Jon and Mel leave together. Tension between Davos and Mel are high because of Stannis, Jon tries not to take sides but actuality ends up helping Mel and not rejecting her romantic advances because he is thankful she brought him back. Davos still respects Jon and agrees to help as long as he can take revenge for Stannis, Davos has the first part of there revenge plan already ready, either having the order, or knowing the order is probs at Stannis last camp site that would make Jon, a legitimised Stark. Cut a long story short Jon is legitimised. Davos wants to go find Stannis's body to bury it. Jon sees his old home with Bolton Banners, they are unable to find Stannis, camera pans to a decapitated body leaning on a tree confirming to viewer Stannis is dead. (This part probs doesnt need to happen). Jon goes to the wildling's for support to his claim of winterfell, they agree Tormund saying some shit like ""if i can't have Mance as my ruler, then you are the closest second i would have"". due to the wildlings already receiving abusive from the Night's Watch and Boltons. The closest holdfast to where they are is the Last Hearth and Jon and crew (Davos and Mel) decide they need to go there to gain Umber support as they respect strength and bravery and a simple envoy would not be enough, they dont enjoy Bolton rule and they all think at hte very least they would not turn over a Stark to the Boltons. Jon goes to the Last Hearth, declarers himself true Lord of Winterfell and the North, Small Jon Umber now lord of the Last Hearth laughs saying there is someone you should meet. BOOM! Rickon meets Jon again, the two reconcile and agree rid the North of the Boltons. Small John explains he was keeping Rickon a secret to marry to his daughter when they both came of age then conquer the north for them. Jon and Small John send ravens out asking for support, sending Davos to Karthold and White Harbour to gain there support as it will be vital. Howland reed is the first to respond and travels with his men to the Last Hearth, explaining he would fight for the Starks till the end and hoping to find Jojen and his sis (can't remember her name) further North. THE Karthstarks ally themselves with the Boltons (due to Robb killing there lord in S3 cant remember his name) and capture Davos, but not before Davos can convince White Harbour for there support, who when arriving in the Last Hearth tell Jon about Davos.

Meanwhile with Brienne and Pod and Ramsay 

Brienne kill Stannis (he is dead deal with it!) and the two noticed the lit candle, when trying to break into Winterfell they notice footprints leading away. Pod suggests that Sansa and whoever she was with are going to the wall to see Jon who is LC (not knowing about hte events of last season) Ramsey also following the tracks is thinking hte same thing. Brienna and Pod run it some of Ramsay's men who they kill. Ramsey deciedes they should track them down and kill them, they somehow capture Pod to lure out Brienne who is predictably lured out, she kills all of Ramsay's men and wounds Ramsay herself before he can escape, Brienne frees Podric before dying of her wounds, she gives Pod Oathkeeper asking him to keep her oath for her. Pod agrees and sets out to follow the tracks. He hears the story of the new Northern Rebellion led by Jon and Rickon he deciedes that he should go there to look for Sansa. Ramsay again thinks the same thing and tries to with ""Twenty good men"" kidnapp Sansa - this fails and Ramsay is held captive by Small John

meanwhile with Sansa and Reek
 Sansa wants to go North to the wall, Reek wants to go to the Iron Islands. the two argue but then Sansa being smart deciedes they should go to the Iron Islands, as there is not guarantee Jon would/even could protect her and the iron islands were for not at least out of Ramsay's reach but trick people into thinking they should go to the wall. Reek and her go north narrowly avoiding Ramsay's men and ironically Pod and Brienne, before arriving at Bear Island. The bad ass 12 year old Mormant who said the North only knows one king whose name is stark, expalians to Sansa what Jon is doing, and that her and her men are going there, Sansa agrees to go with her as long as Theon who has stopped calling himself Reek can go back to the Iron Islands. Sansa and co join Jon at the Last Hearth After being safely in the hands of Euron Grey-joy, Theon wants to go home, however Euron and the Grey-joy fleet take the undefeneded Bear Island and start there invasion of the North, Theon is fucking mad murders Euron when he is sleeping and escapes trying to find his way to the Last Hearth - his fate from hear on is unknown.

 Ed takes up the role as primary wall character for one episode, just enough to show the white walkers are attacking the wall, Ed dies in the attack and thosands of wights make it through before they stop the onslaught. Only Olly survives (cause fuck olly) 

Back to Jon

The Boltons amass there forces just outside the Last Hearth, out numbering the Stark Forces but not by much (e.g 200-300 men), Small John decides a seige would destroy the momentum of hte rebellion and they need to face them on the field. Jon is unconvinced but agrees when a number of hte other lords think it is a good idea. The Stark forces are beaten on the field losing half there number, due to being to focused on attack and Roose having some sort of pro plot-armour strategic plan and a man advantage, they retreat back to the last Hearth, Pod who has swore fealty to Jon dies from his wounds within the Last Hearth, but not before Jon can grant him his wish and knight him - Pod also gives him oathkeeper explaining that it is techniquely his sword because its made from Ice. Jon leaves Podric in his room and morns him and the dead with the others, they lost small John in the fighting and only Howland reed remains to advice Jon and Rickon. Jon deciedes they must negoite a surrender so Howland Reed and the other men can go home, not matter hte price, Sansa and Rickon will be smuggled out. Sansa ruins this at the last minute by murdering there one barganining chip Ramsay for what he did to Theon. Podric becomes Wight and they have to kill him again and start burning the bodies just after doing this, the wights from the wall attack nad kill the Bolton army, Roose included, the season ends the Stark storyline by showing the Last Hearth now under seige by an army of Wights and white Walkers.

Meanwhile with Sam and Gilly

Sam goes to Oldtown not before stopping past his old home (cant remember the Name) he is jeered at by his father and brother, Sam snapps saying he killed a Thenn and a white Walker and his brother has done nothing, his brother says he is lying. Randal believes Sam, the two bond a little bit - sam doesnt hate him as much. Randal gives Sam food and protection to old town also saying gilly can stay there where it is saver. Sam agrees. Sam does Maester training, when asked to specilise, he remebers about Long Claw at the wall, he wants to learn about hte smitthing of valaryean steal and he learns about a smith who could recast the stuff at KL, he goes there at speaks to the man about him, when leaving hte smith he is cornered by a charter we have not seen in while urging him not to go there, explaining he is three times the smith, sam explains why he is there, the two exchange names and sams part of the season ends with this stranger to sam going ""my name is Gendry""

LF & Roose Time: 
LF with his army march north, hiding there movements. Baelish's spies tell him about Jon - and is actuality LF who beats the Karthstarks to telling him about Jon's new army. He encourages Roose to march saying that the Knights of the vale will join him at the Last Hearth for the siege, as many Northern houses are flocking to support the new Stark cause just havent arrived at the Last Hearth yet. The Knight's of vale moving with these lessers houses would make the Bolton Job easier and demoralise Jon's army when they are greatly out numbered. He encourages Roose to keep Sansa alive still claiming she is the key to holding hte North but is an expendable loss if needs be. Roose heeds his advice and marches north, there is little option, either Jon raises a huge army and takes winterfell or the rebellion can be nipped in the bud early, also Ramsay is his only living Earth Walda and his child die during Child birth, speculation over weather or not Ramsay kills Walda. Roose however isn't quite as silly as LF thinks, he agrees to marry another Frey Women in exchange for Frey reinforcements to hold Winterfell - who arrive there quicker than Baelish does. LF lay's siege to Winterfell defended by the Frey's and the garrison Roose left - word doesn't reach roose till its too late however Word does get to Lord Walder, he takes this as a declaration of War and now the Riverlands are at war the vale - this complicates LF's plan a little, he splits his army in too, half going North under the pretense help Jon and mainly secure Sansa under Royce (or how ever you say his name's command) the other half under baelish to take the Riverlands. Baelish receives local support from the Riverlands claiming he will restore a tully leadership plus is the Lord of Harrenhall - The riverlords rebel agaist Lord Walder and the rebellious Lords and the knights of the vale take the twins murdering Walder frey and his children, they hang them from the top of the twins. Little Finger now marches north again to meet Sansa, claiming he is to swear fealty to the Northern Rebellion however the viewer does think he will swear fealty however are doubtful about him actulley keeping his oath. Roose is presumably killed by the white walkers at hte Last Hearth 
KL and Dorne
 The sand snakes disappear into hiding. Jamie arrives home to show Cersi dead Mrycella, Cersi and Jamie have a fight and stop there incest flings. Clegane Bowl happens and Robert Strong wins, however before this the only person who Tommen will allow to speak to him is Kevan as whilst Cersi was in jail the two bounded, Kevan goes on to explain that Margery and Loras in prison is most likely Cersi's work - he suggests that perhaps Robert Strong should not fight for Cersi. However Tommen disagrees with just allowing his mother to die, but feels she should have nothing more to do with the crown and if Robert Strong is to win Cersi is to be sent to Casterly Rock. Robert Strong wins, Cersi is sent to Casterly Rock where she plots and schemes for hte rest of hte season with Kaybern (wrong spelling i know) and Robert Strong. Loras and Margery lose in there trial - Tommen loses his shit - says he is disarming faith militant they rebel and save margery but Loras dies in the situation, Tommen and Margery develop a strange relationship growing both closer and more distant. Tommen begins to resent Cersi blaming her for Loras's death. Dorne are handed an ultimatum - to find the sand snakes and have them or Doran will be branded a traitor and his son will be killed as revenge for Mrycella. Doran can't find the sand snakes who are gone into hiding (thank god we don't get to see them much) Doran can't defuse the situation and sees the only hope in supporting another's claim to the iron throne, War is declared on Dorne, who are able to hold off the Lannister/Tryrell/now back in the fold stormlands assualt but barely. Doran contacts and swear's fealty to Danny, who is coming to Westeros and landing in the riverlands according to her messages. (##hype) I think there would be more emphasise and interaction between charters in particular before his capture, mel and Jon's romantic relations and Davos.

meanwhile with bran and shit:
Bran practises his wargining/green seeying skills

some cheeky S7 predictions based on this theory - bran senses his sibling (or sees them) in danger when warging, he and the children of hte forest save those at the Last Hearth. - Danny finally attacks Westeros. Jorah meets Jon and demands Long Claw back, Jon is fine to oblige - wanting to take oathKeeper as it was technique Ice a sword he always wanted - Dhario = Benjen? - Jon's wants Lord Eddard to be his father but starts to doubt it/ - Jon's rebellion is reinforced by the arrival of the brother hood without banners claiming Jon and the Lord of lights chosen - Sam and Gendry learn how to make Valrian steel, much excitement - Jon's rebellion is stuck between advancing southern forces and the white walkers - Margery gets Pregnant Cersi uses this as an excuse to return claiming to see her grandchild - Tommen dies as a result of Cersi's scheming. Cersi hear broken kills herself - Tyrell's pretty much rule seven kingdoms - Jorah's grey scale worsens and he dies - one of danny's dragon's dies fighting white walkers and we get an ice dragon (we then get a Drogon v Ice dragon fight) - Doran gets some respite as Lannister and Tyrell forces move north to deal with Danny and also Jon's rebellion - possible marriage between Danny and Jon for Danny to gain Northern support - a red wedding esc situation? (e.g shock death of a few main characters who we all know and love)

29,2utsjl,Series-watching guide for the squeamish? (Details inside),"Hi, all- first off, I apologize if this kind of post isn't allowed here, I'm new. I've heard a lot about GoT and have been meaning to watch it, but I'd put it off due to being busy with school. However, I was recently assigned a project in my college class that requires me to research the show by watching it. Perfect opportunity, right? Well... for a variety of reasons, I'm pretty squeamish when it comes to sex & violence. I tend to look away when there's a lot of gore or nude acts on screen. I've heard that there is a fair amount of both in GoT, which makes completing the assignment difficult. Are there any viewing guides or episode breakdowns that I could read to let me know when in the series these sorts of things take place? For instance, it'd be great if I could know in advance when to fast forward through a very bloody scene. Or, would I just be better off reading the books?  
  
I know this probably sounds rather silly (I will admit, I'm a rather silly person) but if something like this did exist, I would be greatly appreciative. Thank you for reading.

31,28w62n,Should I watch GOT?,"Obviously everyone here and everywhere else loves the show, but I watched the first episode and never really got into it. I was wondering if it was just the first episode, and things get better.

The first episode had incest, murder, child murder to protect the secret of incest, lots of unnecessary nudity and no clear protagonist. And from what I've seen elsewhere, there's rape and the death of beloved characters waiting ahead. All of this just seems really depressing, and really throws me off. 

That last scene of the kid getting thrown off the tower is what stopped me from continuing the series a few months ago. But seeing all the hype, I've thought about giving it another go and hoping that things get better and that the positive outweighs the negative.

58,bu1p8c,[SPOILERS] Dear Everyone Who Hated the Game of Thrones Finale,"I didn’t hate the ending to Game of Thrones. I didn’t love how everything happened. But I don’t disagree with the outcome.

Let me start by saying the show WAS rushed. This could’ve been seasons longer — not just episodes longer. Some things remain unclear. For that, I too have frustrations. It definitely wasn’t perfect (see: Starbucks cup and water bottle). Most fans’ pain points are focused on the fact that things weren’t “explained.” I can see that. But I’m also the psycho who kind of likes the fact that things weren’t spelled out perfectly. Some things were open to our own interpretation.

Since Sunday night, I’ve seen angry texts, tweets and posts questioning things that happened (or didn’t happen)—including questions that I thought there were clear answers to. So, right or wrong, I wanted to give some insight from someone who didn’t absolutely hate the ending.

&#x200B;

**“Dany fought for 8 seasons and became one of our favorite characters for absolutely nothing.”**   
No. Dany fought for 8 seasons to get to where she is today so that we could fall in love with her character. Just like Jon fell in love with her. The writers wanted us to respect all the good she has done in this world. They wanted us to WANT her on the throne — so that we could feel as much emotion as we did when she died. We were supposed to be just as torn as Jon was.

&#x200B;

**“Why would there be a Night’s Watch if the white walkers are gone?”**   
There isn’t. The show ended with all of the wildlings leaving the wall behind them. Jon is king of the free folk. Brandon put him in the “true north” where he belongs.

&#x200B;

**“Jon being a Targaryen doesn’t matter.”**   
A). In a show where power and family names rule all of Westeros, Jon didn’t want it. He never wanted any of it. The one true heir to the iron throne was the very person who wanted it least. That’s essentially what the entire show is about. He had to secretly be someone with power to make that message clear to viewers.   


B). Dany finding out Jon was Targaryen was the tipping point in going mad. She realized she could never be loved as a leader like he is… even though he pledged his allegiance.

&#x200B;

**“What happened to the prophecy?!”** 

Azor Ahai killed his love to save the world. Jon was brought back to life to kill Dany, the woman he loved, to save the entire world from destruction.

&#x200B;

**“So there were no green eyes?”** 

Little Finger had green eyes. For people complaining that Arya didn’t kill Cersei, I don’t think there’s anything more cliche than her saying for 6 seasons she’s going to kill the queen… and having it play out perfectly. I’ll take realistic over predictable.

&#x200B;

**“Bran said: I’m the three-eyed raven now. I can’t be Lord of Winterfell. Now he’s suddenly saying: What do you think I came all the way here for?”**   
Bran says this when the entire world is against them. He says this before they wiped out the entire army of the dead and before they took down Cersei and King’s Landing. Obviously a LOT has changed since then. Just because he says “what do you think I came all the way here for” also does not mean he necessarily “wants” it. He is saying he understands that this is his purpose, and he’s ready to fill it.

&#x200B;

**“Tyrion is a literal prisoner. How is he determining the fate of who rules?”**   
As a side note, I hated this little circle pow-wow they all had. Not who they chose, but HOW they chose could’ve been better. BUT. There is not currently a ruler or anyone in power because the queen died. Tyrion was the hand of the queen. He has power by default and the least people can do is listen.

&#x200B;

**“How does Bran have the best story out of everyone?!”**   
I don’t think this is meant to be taken so literally. Bran is the world’s memory. He represents all people in the realm. He has the best story because he has ALL the stories.

&#x200B;

**“How do you pick Brandon Stark — someone who sat there doing absolutely nothing all series — for the throne.”** 

And here is my aha moment: I think this is literally the point of the entire show.

Since the beginning we are conditioned to believe that it’s about the lengths people will go to sit on the iron throne. But over the course of 8 seasons, we see what power, greed and selfishness can do in the hands of the wrong people. Even some of our favorite characters. Because of this, we slowly start learning that the throne is not actually all it’s cracked up to be. In fact, the throne itself is the problem. Hence Drogon burning it. We also learn that maybe the best rulers are the ones who don’t want to rule. And this journey of what we thought was always a quest for power, suddenly becomes far more than that: it becomes a search for purpose. This turn of events is called irony. And the show has ALWAYS been about irony.

**An unwanted bastard being the true heir to the iron throne.**  
**A rejected imp becoming hand of the queen.**   
**Dany becoming the father she swore she’d never become.**   
**Cersei’s precious “red keep that has never fallen” being what crumbles and kills her.**   
**Arya, who has assumed other identities all her life, sailing away under a huge Stark banner.**   
**Bran, the one person to never care about greed, power or ruling, being the ONE person to have it all in the end.**  
 **A show about the importance of a throne actually being about its undeniable pitfalls.**

Call me crazy. But to me, there’s nothing more fitting than this ending.

Sure, the predictable, happy-go-lucky, Jon-and-Dany-rule-together sounds great. But that’s NOT Game of Thrones. It’s never been. And don’t get me wrong—all of our fan theories are more than entertaining. But just because they didn’t happen, doesn’t give the show any less of an awe factor.

“The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.” That’s what it’s always been about: the Starks.

Was it perfect? Not in the slightest. Could they have done more? Yes. Do I think there were things left unexplained? Of course. But I think it’s so impressive what they’ve done with this story since the beginning. A character I would go to war for might be someone you would kill. The ending I’ve been pulling for might be the opposite of what you hoped to see. The writers allowed us to connect with different characters, feel different emotions, want different things… all from the same show. Regardless of what we agree and disagree on… This has been so fun to follow for the past 8 seasons.

I hope fans can eventually get the bad taste of this last season out of their mouths. I also hope fans find what they’re looking for in GRRM’s book, which we now know will be slightly different than the show. But despite its imperfections, I’ll be appreciating everything Game of Thrones has given us in the meantime: one hell of a good story.

If she were left back at the Wall, she would have been finished by the scoundrel crew of the Night's Watch. Even if they'd continued along the journey and Ramsay hadn't burned their stock, her sacrifice would have been necessary to wade through the snow. If Stannis was adamant about not making such a sacrifice, all of them, Shireen included, would have been left to starve and die out there wig there being no point to the whole effort. My guess is hat she may die in some way in the book, perhaps when/if the Wall falls.

67,6uyphb,"Connection between Rhaegar, Jon and Night King","Raegar and Lyanna's sexual relationship resulted in the birth of Jon Snow. However, he is taken by Ned Stark at the request of Lyanna. Rhaegar was killed by Robert Baratheon in a combat but neither the combat nor his corpse is shown throughout the show. We also know by the descriptions given by Viserys and Barriston Selmy that Rhaegar was a strong fighter and couldn't easily be killed. This all points out that he might still be alive.
The Night King takes away new born boys and turns them into whitewalkers. But why only new born boys? It's because he himself never got to be a father to Lyanna's son and he didn't even get a glimpse of his own child(Jon). In Se7 Ep6, he(R) even gets his own dragon.
We also see that the Night Watch holds Bran's hand during one of his visions and Bran soon says- ""I need to talk to Jon."" According to his powers, he can get to know everything about a person by simply touching him. Therefore, when Night King touches Bran, he(bran) gets to know the whole truth about Jon's birth.
Also, Jon coincidentally sees the Night King taking away a baby boy and said""I saw who took them."" Now, Little Sam is the only child rescued and Jon had a big part in saving him and Gilly. 
Lastly, the look that the Night King gives to Jon during their battle (Whitewalkers vs wildlings and winterfell) is quite noticeable.

Later, after Robert is mauled by the boar, Ned is transcribing Robert's will. Robert tells him to write that Ned will be protector of the realm until ""my son Joffrey comes of age"", but Ned writes ""rightful heir"".  because he knows that Jon Snow is Robert’s son and the rightful heir.

69,4m4c1b,Daario/ Euron/ Victarion theory!! Dragon fire hot!!,I think that Victarion Greyjoy is actually Daario Naharis. Euron sent Victarion to Dany to scout her out and to get a feel of how she is. Now this season we are introduced to Euron. Since season 6 began we have already seen all of Danys ships burnt which means they will need a new fleet to travel to Westeros. Daario also made that comment about needing a thousand ships which he knew his brother Euron had. They are probably funding the harpies as well to expedite Danys move out of Meereen and on her way to Westeros. We still haven't been introduced to dragon binder but DD have not always played things by the books. Euron I think does have dragon binder and plans on having Daario/Victarion blow the horn to trick him because it is supposed to cause death when blown. And because it is Euron he would then take control of the dragons and become a conqueror in his own. It would make for an amazing Dany story arc for next season seeing her fight with out the help of any dragons and it would make Euron the main antagonist if Ramsey dies this season (which I don't think will happen). Showing Daario to actually be Victarion will make fans happy for everyone already believes that Daario is someone else in disguise anyway and it would tie in the Greyjoys with Danys story beautifully. No one knows what Victarion looks like except maybe Varys who has not been on screen with Daario all season or last season. And when Yara and Theon meet up with Dany to warn her/ join her maybe one of them will recognize that Daario is actually Victarion. This is a great theory and I hope it comes true..,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/4m4c1b/daario_euron_victarion_theory_dragon_fire_hot/,2016-06-02 03:54:12

He was explaining the real castle used to portray winterfell has 40' tall walls but in the show they are described at 80' ... so that means when we see a 6' tall person in the show they are really 12' tall 🤗 so armies can actually march twice the speed we would anticipate.

And I have a lot of comments to these ""fans"", but remembered [what Kit said](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27129141/kit-harington-game-of-thrones-critics-fans/?fbclid=IwAR2yybm-RAcDSsQ2M1GuBS857KXkkAQKF5rwlTljkC8VihXAyOm1hj6uqGs) before S08 started airing.

**So yeah, FUCK the critics or these ""fans""**. I love this show from the very beginning, and there is something in GoT that you can't din in any other movie, tv show, or book. The characters and story, the world building, lore, and more.

*Advice: If you really are a fan of the show, I suggest you just sit back and watch it, accept it, and absorb it until the last episode. or else you're gonna have a shitty time and ruin the experience.*

87,39jumk,[S5 Spoilers] Idk about this season...,"I love Game of Thrones, but personally for me this season has been shaky at best. I'm not a book reader, but I do read post episode discussions that go over lore and book detail, but don't spoil future events. The show is departing more from the books and making more stuff up this season. I feared that would lower the quality of the show and writing and my fears have been confirmed. 

I can't for the life of me understand why they would include horrible characters like the Sand Snakes and cut the many cooler characters they could have included. I've found the entire Jamie/Bronn/Sand Snake arc to be just terrible. There have been a fair amount of just badly directed scenes. The Unsullied are just about the worst fighting force in Essos apparently. I don't think the way they changed the Faith Militant has worked well or the gay crusade. There has been some terrible CGI. HBO has billions of dollars. Why can't they get good looking CGI? Characters have acted out of character in my opinion a lot this season. That's what I'm the most unhappy about. Also, there have been some examples of extremely convenient things happening that are very cliché and Hollywood-like (Sam with the Direwolf and the Drogon rescue as two examples).

The thing I'm most upset about is what Stannis did in the last episode. I wasn't shocked because the foreshadowing in that episode was extremely obvious. I knew what was coming and it just made me annoyed at the show writers. For the entire show Stannis has been a loving father and his wife has been a cruel mother. Especially this season and literally the episode just before he was disgusted by the idea of sacrificing his daughter. Then all of a sudden he changes his mind, he switches roles with his wife (opposites day?), and he kills his daughter. Yes, he sacrificed others, but they were not his daughter who he clearly demonstrated his love for in many scenes and since her birth. Stannis in the books must be a lot different and/or portrayed a lot differently (like unsympathetically) because for show Stannis it felt completely out of character to me. A couple other things about it that don't make sense are that he killed his only heir from a barren wife and the fact that he withstood a siege and starvation and disease for a year at Storm's End yet quickly decided to kill his daughter to end similar circumstances. What this really feels like to me is another Shae type situation which the show writers handled poorly in the end.

125,7387zz,Castration (emasculation) on GOT,"Theon, Lord Varys, and Greyworm all are physically emasculated (their penis and testes were cut off) eunuchs, but it doesn't seem to have changed their appearance much, or made them look at all androgynous on the surface. Well, except for Varys, but definitely not Theon and Greyworm. 

Theon was physically emasculated on the show by Ramsay Bolton when he was around 19-20 on the show, meaning that the shaft of his penis AND his testes were hacked off, except it happened later in life after he went through puberty, so it makes more sense why he doesn't appear that androgynous and more masculine. Still, he's an exceptional case. 

Theon can still grow a  straggly looking beard, besides the limp, he seems to have decent muscle tone and be in a lot better shape since he escaped from Ramsay in spite of the fact that it happened to him on the show's timeline nearly four years ago, I guess, he's just an exceptional case, who got lucky to not have too many physical changes to his body after getting cut, which is rare without HRT. However, it makes more sense as to why he appears more masculine since he was cut in his adulthood. 

Grey Worm was  physically emasculated (his penis and testes) were cut before puberty, though. All of the Unsullied army were, so it makes absolutely no logically consistent biological sense that they would not be much taller, higher voiced, and thicker chested. It makes no sense that they would make a good army because the significant depletion of testosterone would slow them down.

Meanwhile,  Varys was a child when he was physically emasculated, and his testosterone depletion is much more obvious, He's on the chubby side, and smooth skinned. Although his voice should logically be higher pitched, he's probably the closest thing to what a real life eunuch in the medieval era would look like on the show. 

However, this is GOT, so when has anything ever made any realistic sense in terms of the laws of nature and human biology? Bran fell 50 feet from a tower, and still survived in the first season. Dragons fucking exist! Characters, who died, can be resurrected. If eunuchs can still be in good shape, have a strong sex drive, be muscular, and grow gristly beards without HRT in the medieval era, then I don't question the laws of nature, or biology anymore. I actually really like Missandei and Grey Worm's relationship, Theon is my favorite character on the show, and metaphorically speaking, he has had more balls and humility now than he did back in S2 before they were cut, and Lord Varys is great because of all his hilarious snide comments.

Daario goes on at length about using daggers to take down larger opponents, and in an especially threatening manners towards Hizdahr. Daggers are the weapon of choice of the Harpy. And if you view Hizdahr as being in a sense ""larger"" than Daario by birthright, since Hizdahr is a nobleman and Daario was a former sellsword - this could be some serious trolling and foreshadowing of the coming Harpy attack on Hizdahr. This all seems like compelling evidence pointing to Daario as the leader of the Sons of the Harpy.

134,4oobkf,[S06E09] Think this week's episode will be fun? Not according to computer science.,"(The spoiler below mentions events up to S06 E08, which was last week.)
There's an old riddle invented by computer scientists that can be perfectly applied to the next episode of Game of Thrones. 

The castle at Winterfell needs liberating, and there are two armies in the area that want to have a crack at it. Sansa Stark leads a small army from the north. Littlefinger, another small army from the south. If an individual army attacks the castle on its own, or they attack one at a time, they're too small and will be destroyed by Ramsay Bolton, (62 Psycho-Mormonts notwithstanding). But if both armies attack at the same time, they'll overwhelm the castle and win. 

As you know, all communication in the Game of Thrones universe is done by raven, some of whom are bound to be shot down in flight, so the sender can't be sure the receiver will get the message. Neither army will move unless they're sure that the other army will join them.

So how many messages need to be passed back and forth to ensure a successful attack?

eg, Sansa sends a raven that says 'Attack at 9:00am tomorrow. Are you in?' and waits for a reply. She won't attack until she knows Littlefinger will be there too. Littlefinger responds '9:00am tomorrow sounds good to me! Let me know you got this message.' But he won't attack either until he knows that Sansa got his reply, just in case Sansa thinks that Littlefinger didn't get her first message and stays put. Sansa replies 'Got your message. 9:00am is on!' But won't attack either until Littlefinger replies, because she knows Littlefinger won't attack unless he's sure Sansa got his first message. And so on to infinity. Which would make next week's episode rather long. 

So it's more likely that they'll just attack while undermanned, and be cut to pieces like one of Lady Crane's ex-boyfriends. In other words, according to computer science, this week's episode might not be all that fun.

This riddle is also called The Byzantine Generals problem, devised by computer scientists in the 70s, and now applies to all sorts of things from Bitcoin to torrenting. Can you figure out how to get the generals to attack before the heat death of the universe? (Which, given the title of episode 10, may be sooner than we think).",3,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/4oobkf/s06e09_think_this_weeks_episode_will_be_fun_not/,2016-06-18 16:29:41

Margaery was feeding him the pie and Olenna made some ominous references to killing people at weddings, but what could the Tyrells have to gain from Tommen (sp?) taking the throne instead of Margaery/Joffrey's future child? Nope.

Then Margaery said something, and I realized... What if the stupid asshole just choked on some pie?

151,6vys7v,Chaos Theory: Why LF is ultimately the most noble man?,"A little study on the internet will tell is about the Chaos theory of mathematics which is focused on the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. One of significant aspects of this theory is the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems — a response popularly referred to as the butterfly effect — rendering long-term prediction of their behavior impossible in general. The theory was summarized by Edward Lorenz. 

Again LADDER also refers to stages of a process or stepwise reaching to an outcome. And every step maximizes the possibilities out desired outcome.

So why talk of mathematics or physics in GOT. Well, I believe the statement CHAOS IS A LADDER is not just a statement but an indication that everytime there is a change in reality, there is a butterfly effect taking the realm towards a bigger havoc. Further he says ""many who try to climb fail, the fall breaks them.""  Indicating in each step taken further on the ladder magnifies the destruction. 

Now who can change reality? Bran Stark of Winterfell or rather...Bran Starks of Winterfell. (Refer the One Bran is them  all) It's Bran the Builder who ensured the wall to secure return. So each time Bran is born, he makes one change with intentions to better but only to lead towards mayhem.

Like a WW can be killed by Valerian (Damascus) steel blade, the Knight King can be killed by the blade with a ladder mark (if u remember Catspaw, it has ladder pattern) to stop the Chaos. 

The bitter-sweet end will be all of us realizing that LF was not the ultimate villain. Yes, he had his vices but don't we all. His intentions were to stop the ladder. Arrest the Chaos. But irony is, Chaos is unpredictable and probably he will not be able to predict his execution in S7E7. 
 
It is not GRRMs style to paint a character in complete black or whilte then why has Petyr Baelish been all dark? We have been fooled to suppose that Ned Stark was the most noble man in Westeros, but we saw his story of killing Ser Arthur Dayne to be flawed. He will fool us again by making us hate LF all the while he lives.

162,btagt5,[SPOILERS] I signed the rewrite petition. Here’s why and how I thought the season could be better. #2,"Episode 4 and 5

If Episode 3 was a betrayal by plot structure, than these episodes are a betrayal by character development. That’s not to say that I don’t think the characters went in viable directions per say. 

Daenerys turning into her father as the Mad Queen was interesting and different in a good way. Flipping the script to have Cersei become the victim and Daenerys as the villain is another interesting idea but the execution was poor. More specifically, there wasn’t enough build up to this switch. In fact, there was basically none. 

Now, some people might point to the number of times Daenerys has executed somebody by dragon fire, or the number of killing sprees she’s backed as early signs of her cruelty; and I agree with you. Nobody said she was perfect or a pushover, but her cruelty and mercilessness has always been for a purpose. 

One singular purpose, in fact, that has defined her character since she was first introduced: Empowerment. Every move she has made has either empowered herself, others, or eliminated an obstacle to universal empowerment. The Breaker of Chains values life, and she wants all of it to be treated equally. 

We’ve seen her waver, but she’s always stayed true to this singular focal point. This also happens to be the development strategy that has built up every major character in this show. 

Don’t believe me? Let’s go through some of the characters. Sansa has been about growing out of naivety. In season one, she was basically a princess, totally oblivious about the real world. Circumstances in the show, however, have (rather brutally) forced her to grow up and now we have the fierce don’t-touch-me-or-I’ll-feed-you-to-your-own-dogs Sansa we all know and love. 

Jaime has been about redemption. First, it was overcoming his title as the back stabbing King-slayer, and later it was about making up for all the harm he did while he was at Cersei’s side. 

Arya has been about finding your own path. She was supposed to be a lady, but she wanted to be a warrior. She was supposed to help take care of Winterfell after Ned died, but she wanted revenge and became an assassin. Men are supposed to court her but she tells them to shut up and lie down.

Characters embodying simple and predictable mantras are placed into chaotic circumstances to see how they respond. It’s a great strategy, but what’s critical to making it work is that while the circumstances may change rapidly, the characters must change slowly. The entertainment and realism comes from us being able to watch characters slowly evolve as their understanding of their mantra changes. 

In episode 3, Daenerys embodied her mantra more than she ever has before. She literally empowered all life in Westeros with her army to fight against death itself. 

Seven whole seasons were dedicated to this achievement. 

Two episodes later, though, she is the antithesis of universal empowerment, burning tens of thousands of innocent people to death to achieve her own selfish ends. Now, it’s not like this couldn’t happen, but you can’t change the core of a character in two episodes and expect it to be believable. 

“But Sand, two of her best friends and her dragon died!” You’re right, Missandei, Jorah, and Rhaegal did die, rather cruel deaths at that, but let’s think about what Daenerys has been through. 

When we first met her, her entire family, except for her brother, had been slaughtered. That same brother regularly abused her before selling her off as an unwilling bride. Unsurprisingly, she was raped as an unwilling bride, but still managed to find love for her rapist. Then, shocker! He almost died too! In an effort to save his life she lost her unborn child, only to have to kill her now borderline comatose husband herself; and that’s just one season. Your telling me all of that didn’t knock her off her focal point, but in the span of two episodes the death of two friends and a dragon will? That doesn’t seem right.

Cersei faces the same issue. We’ve been primed, slowly and meticulously, to understand that Cersei is a force to be reckoned with. An unstoppable typhoon of political intrigue that only shows mercy for her children. But in the span of just ONE episode (really more like half of it) we’re supposed to suddenly feel sympathetic toward her and think that she’s a victim? I’d wager I wasn’t the only one rooting for the caved in ceiling when she met her end. 

Worse yet, it’s not just these two whose character development took a wild turn. I think that almost every character in this episode reverted to the worst forms of themselves. Jaime was on the road to redemption! He’d found a relationship with a nice, non-psychotic woman! And then he leaves her to go back to Cersei and die together with her? The single most corrupting force in his life?! 

Speaking of that lovely non-psychotic woman why’d they have to treat Brienne like that? She was Sir Brienne of Tarth at long last. The title that every man in patriarchal Westeros told her she could never have. She had proven, without a doubt, that no man could hold her back. 

At least, until the end of episode 4, when she finally trusts a guy and then he stomps down her confidence and leaves her crying. Never mind the fact that she’s one of the strongest fighters in Westeros, and was a commanding officer in the fight against death itself. Her man is gone! Now she has nothing!

I mean, they really put down powerful woman in these episodes, and on a whim it seems. Daenerys was the most powerful person on the planet, the defender of all life! Now, she’s emotionally unstable and insane? Cersei was the second most powerful person on the planet and she died suddenly overcome with emotion. Totally helpless as she pleaded for a man not to let her baby die, because obviously she can’t do anything herself right? She’s just the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Missandei was arguably the third most powerful woman (woman, not person, because I think Tyrion has more authority than her) on the planet and she died back in chains. Way to show women their place guys! 

Oh wait… it’s 2019. 

Now, I’m not saying this was the intention of the writers, (I highly doubt that it was) but considering that every other instance of misogyny has been associated with a villain and then eliminated cruelly by a powerful woman, it’s a little off-putting.

Moral of the story here is that even if you have a cool idea to spice up a story you can’t just bend characters into it and think that it’ll work out. You gotta respect character development and TAKE IT SLOW, otherwise the story just won’t make sense.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/btagt5/spoilers_i_signed_the_rewrite_petition_heres_why/,2019-05-26 21:16:54

177,4rgmv9,GoT Speculation: Beyond S06E10 [SPOILERS],"Where do you think the series will go? Now that we're in unknown territory with the show advancing past the books, what is in store for our beloved characters?

Some points to discuss: Jorah, after finding a cure for Greyscale just in time (will he or won't he?), will have to fight Gregor Clegane at some point? Or will Sandor have to fight him? Cersei won't be sitting on that throne for long.

On the one hand you've got the two supernatural defenders of their Queens, but on the other hand, there's the Death vs Life metaphor should Gregor fight Sandor.

Will Jon hand over the North to Sansa? Does Sansa even want it? Will Jon become the new villain? If he takes the North, does that make him a hypocrite, a villain, or both?

What's up with the women taking over? Is that the end game? Will women rule?

Cersei's prophecy came true? She will be Queen, all of her children will die. Maybe the prophecy refers to now that she is actually Queen and not simply the wife of the King or the Queen Mother? The younger more beautiful Queen wasn't Margery but Daenerys? Who's going to kill her? Daenerys? Greyworm? Tyrion? I mean, she's got to die, right?

What about the Citadel? The Maester made a point about ""no women or children"" pretty venomously.

Was Jaime and Cersei's moment at the end of S06E10 to acknowledge the death of Tommen, or was that look terror that he'd have to kill her? Or that he made a huge mistake by leaving or by loving her?

There are so many questions. What are your thoughts about the loose ends this season?

180,4p83wz,[S6E9] Still Memorable Days Later,"It's 2 days later, and I'm still basking in the afterglow of this episode. The things that are still with me, in no particular order:


* Jon was using a Bear Island shield during his final attack on Ramsay.

* Dany appears to have total control over the dragons.

* The other two dragons are *finally* free!

* The banter between Dany and Yara was top-level. Makes me want to see a convo between Dany, Yara, Tyrion, Petyr, Varys, Lady Mormont, and the Queen of Thorns. Like a dinner party 😅

* Tyrion's plan against the masters was brilliant. I'm glad Dany still takes his advice.

* The whole scene with the masters, before and after Dany flies off on Drogon, was fucking brilliant (I'm American, but I love the way the British use that word 😄).

* 1000XP for the single-stroke double kill!

* Dany and the dragons attacking the ships was outfuckingstanding!

* I'm shipping Daenyara and hoping Missandei gets to join in once in a while.

* The iron fleet taking its rightful place as the official navy of Westeros.

* Queens rule!

* Ramsay was a terrific, yet cold-blooded, military strategist.

* Sansa did exactly what Ramsay did: Sacrificed her own men in order to trap Ramsay's forces.

* Sansa was a terrific, yet cold-blooded, military strategist.

* Davos found the stag! Somebody's in trouble!

* Jon really is a damn good swordsman.

* Ramsay really was a damn good archer.

* Sansa having Ramsay locked in the kennel with his dogs was brilliant (there goes that word again). She ruthlessly dispatched her enemy with poise and class. I started off hating her in the first five seasons. This season, I'm #TeamSansa

* I suffocated along with Jon.

* Petyr just earned Sansa's hand in marriage. IJS

* Lady Mormont staring Ramsay down was epic.

181,4np9sa,(Question) Using HBO GoT imagery,"I've tried contacting HBO directly for this query, but I feel like I'm getting copy/paste answers, and they take weeks to get back to me, so I thought I'd try my luck here.
 
Basically I want know whether or not I'm allowed to use HBO's Game of Thrones imagery on my own website.

I plan on creating a GoT character directory website, where it will list all characters that appear on the show, accompanied by some basic information and an image of them.  I'm intending on crediting HBO for the images, and the website is no source of income at all - it's purely a fan made, informational site.

HBO did get back to initially with a generic 'no' answer, but I'm wondering how websites like the GoT Wiki are able to use these images?

Any help or information would be greatly appreciated.

201,boc0h5,[spoilers] This Sucks,"So, obviously I have a few dozen issues with this episode—but, the conclusion is that it, in its purest essence, destroyed years of work and buildup. If you have been a book-reader from Day One, you’ve just had some three-plus decades blown to kingdom come.

After thinking it all through, I think the largest, most egregious, most inimitable unforgivable sin is what they did to conclude Jaime’s arc. I refer you to the fan-made video below called Oathbreaker. It is one of those lovely, cinematic complication pieces featuring great moments and lines, set to some touchingly emotional score by a Explosions-In-The-Sky-type rising score.

It concludes with Ser Jaime’s line about how the pages of the Kingsguard Book still have blank space enough and time enough to be filled with his great deeds.

I think we all sincerely believed this. His ultimate heel-turn back to Cersei is just . . . I don’t even know what to call it other than treason of character and story. It is so purely and insufferably wrong, I sincerely don’t know what to even feel at this moment in time.

I’m not a book-reader myself. But, I am steeped deeply in the lore and background of ASoIaF, in just about every way. And, I am appalled.

No prophecy-fulfillment; no resurrection of morality; no goodness shown; not even any bad-ass-ery. Just a meaningless and truly unnecessary fight with Euron and then a death-by-falling-rubble.

He didn’t kill Cersei. He didn’t stop her evil ways. He didn’t even try to talk about turning over a new leaf. He just hugged her as they died.

It was astoundingly rushed and forced, and of course entirely wrong for the character. Even Cersei deserved a better ending than a few thousand pounds of bricks cascading on her.

A few other relative-to-that-awfulness gripes: A. Why in the holy seven fucks was Davos 1. complicit in breaking out Jaime; and 2. at the vanguard of the attack?! He has repeatedly announced his incompetence with a sword and in battle—other than in a strategic, field general manner. And, he’s on the front lines??

B. Why did Dany suddenly figure out the cheat codes for Drogon \ dragon combat? I’ve reference before that it just didn’t seem that dragons were actually all that fantastic of weapons—as we’ve seen two die by spears. Heck, the second was literally killed by just a guy. On a boat. But, now b/c of rage (?), Dany can just pull off this perfectly scripted and executed attack pattern?

C. Why bother doing the hoop-jumping of evening out the opposing sides forces to “roughly equal” just to have the Lannister side annihilated within mere minutes?? The Golden Company got a nearly comedic send-off. There could’ve been a rimshot when Homeless Harry gets harpooned by Grey Worm. (Also, why did half a dozen Dothraki ride past without decapitating him? It’s not as if GW had a personal vendetta against Harry Strickland, and therefore made that kill meaningful to him, personally.)

D. Speaking of GW, why did he throw a spear at the surrendering army? I understand his rage and anger. But, did he discuss this with his queen beforehand? I was under the impression that if the city was falling and the opposing forces surrendering (with the bells tolling), the idea was then a peaceful ending. And, it was just Dany’s rage \ madness that sent her on the killing spree.

Did GW just act independently? Or, was this plotted out in advance?

E. Speaking of the surrender and whatnot: Why in the fucking fuck did the erstwhile-decent and good soldiers of the North and the ultra-disciplined Unsullied decide to slaughter innocents?! And rape and pillage?? The Unsullied obviously have no use for the former—and hardly the latter.

Why oh f’ing why did these guys suddenly just turn into the worst persons on Planetos?!! It makes literally zero sense. Is it b/c Dany did? Well, she literally was killing plenty of her own by the end—which also is galling and makes zero sense.

F. Why didn’t Dany fly straightaway to the giant bullseye-painted tower that was holding her ultimate enemy as soon as she had the chance??

I could go through the alphabet and alphanumerics until it looks like the mythical end of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet . . . . issues such as how absurd The Mountain looked (like a somehow worse version of an old Hulk movie); what TM’s abilities and limits are; why they had to use yet-another reused thing with the eye\skull-crush. Arya not being allowed to quietly assassinate the queen. The cleverest and sneakiest man in the show’s history not even attempting to mount a defense against treason; why Tyrion wasn’t also burned; why Jon wasn’t also. Why did Arya suddenly become a bumbling dummy who was no better at escaping or hiding than anyone else? Why every single person—especially soldiers on both sides—didn’t immediately flee the city upon seeing the deliberately performed carpet-bombing, block by block? Why didn’t Sandor kill Cersei? Why did Q’Byrn (sic, I’m sure—and I just don’t care enough any longer) have his story arc end with a comic Pratt fall? Why haven’t we received any payoff to any of the singular theories and prophecies???!!

Why oh fucking why, why, why, why, why?!!??!!!!?!

Fuck this show. Fuck this show so bad. Sigh. I am so sorry we have to deal with this nuclear winter that is coming. Hey: A new slug-line for the show!!

217,1fuh07,[Theory/Spoilers S03E09] Roslin Frey,"I have a theory that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere yet. If it has been discussed elsewhere I apologize.

**Roslin is *not* Walder Frey's daughter.**

* As we saw in the lineup, Lord Frey has no other daughter who looks half as decent (apologies to the Ladies Frey)
* Walder owes Robb and his house nothing. Why then would he give away his most beautiful daughter? He may be conniving, but he's certainly not stupid and it is obvious from the beginning that he couldn't care less about the wellbeing of his family. In his eyes, Roslin would have been his greatest asset next to The Twins.
* No one had ever mentioned Roslin before Frey's proposal. You'd think *someone* would have noticed her in her twenty-odd years and she would be the talk of the seven kingdoms. Again, it's possible that Frey would have kept her hidden away as a future bargaining chip.

>*""If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into the meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.""*  
> - Melisandre

- Frey needed to keep the groom and the Northmen happy. Up to this point he had been more than kind, and more kind than usual, providing food and accommodations for the whole of Robb's army. Had the veil revealed one of Frey's average daughters the reception would have been a dreary affair with less wine a'flowing, and Robb and Co. wouldn't have been off their guard. 

So who is Roslin (if that is her real name)?

* Frey took/bought her.
* A volunteer from one of Frey's vassals who did not want their house caught up in the war.
* A gift of Tywin Lannister; (a) because Walder responds well to pretty girls, or (b) for exactly the purpose of being used in the ambush.

I have to admit, I hate the Lannsiters -  except Tyrion (and Tywin - in the beginning) - and I really like(d) all the Starks and all the Tyrells.
(Poor, poor Sansa... :'( )
But Cercei lives on and on and messes more and more things up.
Really, she's insane!
So, as we have experienced before, nearly all our beloved ones (and some cruel characters, finally) are dead, so, maybe we should start to like Cercei and she will die soon... At least like her for a short while (until she's finally gone! You know, I'll cheer, if it's up time!!)",13,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/3fp0ii/maybe_we_should_start_to_like_cercei_to_get_rid/,2015-08-04 05:38:28

235,bkeide,"The Long Night - What COULD have been, but never was.","I am not gonna rant about that shitty episode. There's plenty of that elsewhere. I am gonna share an alternative scenario i thought off in 1 hour, and let you compare it to the one we got.

&#x200B;

A few Dothraki are chosen and given torches, then sent against the enemy to determine the distance between themselves and the wights. Then the humans use the catapults, using projectiles with flamable material not only to kill, but also to provide some sort of light on the battlefield to counter the darkness. The area is slightly lit by moonlight, but not really enough to provide sufficient vision for the troops.

The Knight King decides to send thin waves of wights. Only human wights, not great nor low in numbers and quite spread out. The humans counter the incoming attack by forming groups and using long spears that can actually kill something at quite a distance (like the sarissa weapon, of Alexander the Great).

After realizing they are able to take on the wights, the humans are embolded and their morale is raised, so they sort of spread out of their tighly packed formations and slaying wights left and right. But regardless, the wights are numerous so John or Daenerys flies in to aid the land troops with dragon fire.

But John is worried. Something is wrong, it doesn't feel right. The Night King is nowhere to be seen, same for his dragon. So he takes off to get a look from above and figure out what's going on. He sees the White Walkers in the distance, but not the NK. And the White Walkers are sticking close to the woods. Why is that, he wonders.

As the humans are winning the fight against the wights John hears them as they begin to cheer and boast and celebrate, while at the same time he notices the Walkers giving the signal for the second phase of the assault to begin. This is the true death wave. Countless wights charging into battle, catching the troops off guard and begin to overwhelm them, slamming into their shields and weapons, piling up on them, like a tsunami smashes on the shore. The humans panick, they can't regroup, they retreat to basic instinct survival and their formations fall apart (except for the Unsullied).

They fall back within the castle, while the Dothraki provide cover. The space within Winterfell is too small for their cavalry to work effectively, so thats the only thing they can do now.

Daenerys lights up the trenches. The wight army freezes right before them. That gives the humans a time to regroup and regain their footing. Meanwhile John and Danny take the chance and begin blasting the standing wight army. So then the Night King brings forth the cold mist. This mist covers everything. It greatly reduces the area of vision for the troops, and snuffs out the trenches. The humans no longer see what's before them. John and Danny are lost within the mist so they travel upwards. They encounter the Night King there. He gives John a light smirk, before he plunges right down into the mist and gets lost again. John wants to follow him but Danny tells him its too dangerous, not only is he new to the whole dragon riding business, but he can't do anything within the mist either.

Right at that moment, the NK approaches from below like a shark (with the dragon obviously) and engages with John in dragon combat. Danny dives in as well to try and help somehow, blinded by emotion at that point.

The Night King decides to break the mist cloud, just so he can toy with John and helps him by aiding his field of vision. As the dragons go at each other, the NK's dragon manages a crucial hit on John's dragon, but John's dragon manages to shove his nails in the neck wound of the NK's dragon.

Meanwhile the dead on the ground, the giants have entered the gates. The dead that climb the walls can be held off to a certain extend but now a major strike against their defenses has been managed. The Unsullied position themselves and now they can handle the dead somewhat better now that they can't spread and circle around them. However the giants still remain. Arya takes out a few of them with the bow.

With the mist now gone, Daenerys can clearly see John, and charges on the Night King's dragon. The 2 dragons collide, and the Night King loses his grip and falls on the ground. John's dragon manages to disentangle himself but the jolt throws John off as well, who lands on top of the NK's dragon. There, he takes his chance and plunges his sword in the dragon, effectively killing it. He then begins to fall.

Johns lands on top of the now actually dead dragon, somewhat hurt, bleeding from a stab wound he got as he landed on one of the dragon's scales (or horns? whatever these things are called). Its not a lethal wound, but not easily overlooked either. He is a few meters infront in front of the gate. Behind him, he can see the wights going through the gate. Before him, he sees the White Walkers slowly approaching what is even closer to him, a rising Knight King. Before John can make a decision, Danny shows up and attempts to destroy the Night King. But from within the flames, an iced spear shoots out, and barely misses the heart of the dragon, rendering him out of commission and taking off as he whales in pain, only to crash on the other side of Winterfell.

So John is right there with the NK. The Walkers still have some way to cover. Snow pulls his sword and engages with the NK, who also pulls his weapon. But he is no match for the NK, especially with his wound. His attacks are easily parried, the NK seems to be an elegant, swift and precise fighter. He falls on the ground, and as the NK prepares for the final blow, Ghost shows up and tackles the NK, breaking his focus away from John, buying him some time to put some distance between the two. Then the NK kills Ghost. The Direwolf is now dead. The Walkers have reached NK and they all look at Snow crawling away from them while on his back. Then the NK begins to raise his arms, assuming a T-pose as he reanimates all the fallen soldiers. And just as John thinks he is doomed, his dragon appears damaged and bleeding. It's actually Bran warging in the dragon. But the dragon is heavily hurt and can't do much. So he just picks John and carries him to a relatively safe place.

And that's where the episode cuts. He doesn't fuckin >!die to Arya in less than a minute!<.",1,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bkeide/the_long_night_what_could_have_been_but_never_was/,2019-05-04 02:43:30

253,36qbra,The real problem with season 5 no one seems to be talking about.,"OK, we all know that the Water Garden/Rape/inquisition story lines are stretched and nonsensical at this time. However, I am not bothered by them as much because I can suspend disbelief. The real issue with this season is that there in no chemistry based, suspenseful dialogue that makes the series so great. 

Remember Robert talking to Ned, reminiscing about the old days? You just knew these guys were going to live until the end of the series.

Tywin chatting with Arya at Harrenhall, not knowing her identity? I was sometimes on the edge of my seat, praying she did not get found out.

Remember Tyrion and Cersei going back and forth? Unreal chemistry, humor and oneupsmanship. Every scene was bad assed.

Remember Jamie and Brienne, going back and forth from enemies to sworn and bonded allies? Great transitional dialogue and redemption.

The Rob Stark strategy discussions with Catlyn? The heartbreak when they watched each other dying?

The slow realization that things really were going to get worse for Theon from the hands of Ramsey.

Jon Snow becoming a man and and bonding with his brothers on the wall, while hiding his feelings for his true love?

The evil Joffrey mentally breaking down, and unknowingly building up, Sansa Starks metal capacity.

This season has no awesome, powerful dialogue and intense chemistry like the first 4 seasons. Hopefully it gets better from here. Feel free to share your favorite conversation. For some reason, I really loved the one between Cersei and Robert, when they are talking about the Dothraki invasion, and it turned to them talking about there failed marriage in a mutually respectfull way. It is one of 2 times in the whole series that Cersei shows actual signs of humanity.

272,29mis2,"[Alliance Speculation] [Season 5] This would be absolutely shocking/dastardly, and that's why I think it will happen.","When we leave off in the season finale of Season 4, new challengers to the Iron Throne are arriving. 

We have the Boltons, the Tyrells, and Littlefinger all seeming to eye the throne. 

We have seen the brutality of the Boltons, the betrayal of the Tyrells, and the cunning of Littlefinger and Sansa. 

Now, Roose Bolton seems to be very fond of conquering the North. We get too see that touching moment where he decides to name his son Ramsay Snow a Bolton. I suspect this is merely so that he may command troops in his name, which is bad news for Ramsay. If he isn't killed by a conniving Theon, he will most likely be meeting a particularly unfortunate ending at the hands of his own father. I am of the opinion that Roose will use his son, and dispose of him when necessary, thereby owning him and subsequently disowning him (that would be cool to see his world fall apart, wouldn't it?).

There's more to why I'm writing this. My speculation is that the Boltons, and all of their brutality, will align with none other than the *Tyrell Family* to take the Iron Throne. If not because of their strategic benefits, but if only because it would shock us; that a family such as the Tyrells would ever associate with the Boltons (*knowing what we know about them*). It is no secret that Roose will sell his loyalty to the highest bidder, which would undoubtedly be the Tyrells. 

Littlefinger and Sansa should be mobilizing Robyn Arryn and the Vale to action. The only question is: with whom does Littlefinger align? My bet? The Lannisters. It would be par for the course for Littlefinger to manipulate them into needing him. 

Well anyway, most of this speculation came from (of course) not reading the books or any speculative articles on the internet. I just see an incredible opportunity for GRRM and HBO to send our stomachs into knots when Lord Bolton and Olenna Tyrell shake hands.

TL;DR: A classics professor at The University of Texas at Austin and author of *You Win or You Die: The Ancient World of Game of Thrones* shares some key themes that could help predict the who ends up on the Iron Throne. The Classics won’t predict exactly what happens next in “Game of Thrones,” but according to the professor, classical texts offer a number of suggestions for the structure of the series and how it might unfold. Six theories: 

* The outskirts of the empire could be key for victory.
* Whoever controls the food supply might end up on the Iron Throne.
* Victory might only be temporary.
* Daenerys Targaryen could be the true hero.
* Jon Snow going south is probably not a good idea.
* The Wall will probably remain even after the battle with the White Walkers.

From [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/05/27/why-game-of-thrones-needs-more-sex-scenes/):

**Why ‘Game of Thrones’ needs more sex scenes**

By Alyssa Rosenberg

**WARNING: SPOILERS UP TO S04E09**

>During this “Game of Thrones”-free weekend, I found myself thinking about the most recent episode of HBO’s fantasy epic.
GAME OF THRONES season 4: Emilia Clarke. photo: HBO
Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen. (Photo: HBO)

>Halfway through “Mockingbird,” Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) solves a problem that has been nagging at her since the beginning of the season. Daario Naharis (Michiel Huisman), the hunky mercenary who joined her entourage last season and has been pursuing her since, shows up yet again to profess his love. Amused, and maybe a little irritated, Dany tells Daario: “Do what you do best. Take off your clothes.” He obliges, dropping trou and doing a tiny bit to counterbalance “Game of Thrones” roster of naked ladies. End scene.

>I suppose I should have been relieved that the show had demonstrated a little bit of restraint, given that “Game of Thrones” has never met a brothel scene or a disemboweling that the showrunners decide is better left off-screen. But the uncharacteristically chaste decision to skip over the love scene right to Daario’s departure from Dany’s chambers the next morning was actually a mistake. Maybe “Game of Thrones,” a program that features so much coitus during monologues that the critic Myles McNutt coined the term “sexposition” to describe it, needs more sex scenes.

>Of course, by sex scenes, I mean something very specific. I am not referring to people having intercourse who happen to be in the frame while something else actually related to the core plot happens in the foreground. I am not calling for more scenes where significant male characters lounge around in brothels, checking out the naked merchandise, or hang out in hot tubs with prostitutes who are there to jiggle appealingly and flatter their clients’ egos.

>I definitely do not want to watch more rape scenes on a show that has made its point about the sexual climates of both Westeros and Essos. And I badly hope that the folks in charge of “Game of Thrones” have learned to communicate more clearly with their directors than they did with Alex Graves, who earlier this season thought he had directed a sex scene with complicated power dynamics when many of his viewers saw an unambiguous sexual assault.

>Instead I wonder if “Game of Thrones” needs more sequences in which grown-up couples enthusiastically consent to mutually pleasurable sex.

>As tragically as it ended, the affair between Night’s Watch brother Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and wildling warrior Ygritte (Rose Leslie) was often sweet and sexy, and it was a blessed relief from the relentless misery on “Game of Thrones.” Depicting sexual assault repeatedly is one way to demonstrate that a society is deformed by its monstrous sexual culture and gender norms. But “Game of Thrones” could also get to that same point by examining the ways in which healthier relationships fail to thrive or are killed off by institutions or social pressure.

>Similarly, Ned Stark’s (Sean Bean) death felt like a genuine and enormous loss not just because it subverted genre conventions, nor because he was a straightforward hero, but because he had a family he actually loved. Ned had a wife (Michelle Fairley) whose bed and counsel he seemed to share gladly, and children who adored him. His death was tragic not simply because it was the end of a life, but because in a season, we saw what that life consisted of and what it was worth.

>“Game of Thrones” and the George R.R. Martin novels the show is based on are deeply committed to upsetting the conventions of fairy tales. Happy endings — at least, predictable ones — could upset that core project. But better, more emotionally rooted sex for the characters, and more kind gestures like the wolf Hot Pie (Ben Hawkey) baked for Brienne of Tarth (Gwendoline Christie) to give to his long-lost friend Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) can still be consistent with the story “Game of Thrones” is telling.

>Sometimes, simple friendship, generosity and deep affection can be more miraculous than any vanquished witch or rescued kingdom. And when even those small virtues fail, their loss reminds us of the human stakes that often get obscured by fantastical stories. Dany’s dragons are a miracle. But so is her continued hope for pleasure, and maybe even love.",12,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/282q5z/dumbest_game_of_thrones_article_ive_seen_yet_why/,2014-06-13 23:24:50

322,7l5dgl,Please help some students: What do you think about a Game of Thrones themed Café?,"We, students of media and communication studies from Germany, are planning a hypothetical game-of-thrones-themed café for a business-seminar. In this café you would be served got-like drinks and meals in an ambiance adjusted to the series. Furthermore there would be the opportunity to watch episodes with your friends.
To justify and expand our idea, we have a few questions to you, the game of thrones fans.

-	First of all, we need to know: would you want something like a café in game-of-thrones-style where you also can watch the series? Do you think this concept would attract a lot of fans?
-	What should the café look like? Are there any specific things for the decoration you would think are essential? What should the work clothes look like?
-	What drinks and small dishes would you like to try (e.g. Sansa‘s lemon pies)?

325,bn4yfn,[Spoilers] I haven't really been watching since Season 4,"I've still been following the show, watching odd episodes, but I stopped consistently watching it in season 4.

Part of it was not having a lot of time, so it didn't make the cut. But I also stopped implicitly trusting the rollercoaster the writers were taking me on. This is a matter of opinion of course, but for me that feeling was creeping in the whole season, but was cemented by the scene where Olly kills Ygritte in ""The Watchers on the Wall"".

The whole tearing them apart on opposite sides of a war for survival was good drama. But the way it happened, and in particular the character of Olly, felt cheap and unrealistic, more a form of punchy sadism than even malicious tragedy. I don't really know why it stood out at the time, but it just seemed out of place to me.

Later I read this quote from the wiki:
> Writer's assistant Dave Hill... suggested to Benioff and Weiss that Olly join the Night's Watch, because he had nowhere else to go, and to kill Ygritte during the Battle of Castle Black for dramatic sense. Benioff and Weiss were so impressed with this suggestion that they promoted Hill to write an episode script in Season 5

And it confirmed that I'd gotten off the ride about where I could handle it.

I bring this up because the scene in the recent episode where one of the dragons died gave me the same impression, but seemed 10x more garish. Tragedy aside, the immediate impression was that it broke step with the drama. It felt cheap.

I don't know why exactly I want to share it, I've been fans of franchises before where studio appointed writers, maybe meant to counter-balance the influence of the creator, take the franchise towards their own vision when they get control. It seems like any time you're creating stories in ""someone else's universe"", it becomes easy to take for granted how much the integrity of the original ideas built that world, and how deviations with a short term payoff ultimately hurt the overall narrative.

Anyways it's been said before. But as an older fan kind of coming back for the finale, it's a little bit bitter, but at the same time something that we've seen building for a few seasons. There's a lot of good left though so I'll still keep on it.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bn4yfn/spoilers_i_havent_really_been_watching_since/,2019-05-11 02:48:33

327,bk6fyn,Night King,"Spoilers ahead

Now this seems really and I mean really far fetched but if you read the whole thing you would understand 

On season 4 the “night king” goes to his fortress where he takes one of cratered baby but as we know the night king is quite smart and after watching ep 3 of season 8 I was wondering why would he compromise himself that much just kill bran stark and so it would make some sense if the real Night king was still at the fortress commanding the “night king” 

Anyway just a thought but most of my predictions have come true besides a couple

337,4pyl7z,[No Spoilers] (no spoilers) Season Finale Lannister theory it's a biggie #GOTs #GameOfThrones,"So I subscribe to the theory that we aren't shown things for no reason. What I mean by that is every scene for a greal show such as Game Of Thrones carries meaning in one way or another. Nothing is wasted and for those paying attention you get rewarded. So last week's preview of this week's finale showed amongst other things. A scene where Walder Frey is toasting in what looks like his hall yes the very same hall where the red wedding happened. As he toasts he says ""the Freys and the Lannisters send their regards."" Why show this scene? Previews of upcoming episodes are meant to entice fans. This scene snuck in doesn't really seem like much or it means something if your paying attention. I believe the Freys are going to do it all over again. I believe Jaime and the Lannister army will be slaughtered by the hands of Walder Frey and his forces. Red Wedding part deux, why? First of all the Freys aren't really beholden to anyone they have already done the worst thing possible in betraying the Starks. When you don't learn from history you are doomed to repeat it. Why in the world would anyone with an army ever let there guard down and celebrate with the Frays!?! I wouldn't be caught DEAD (pun intended) in that hall with that band & with those Freys. Motive you ask? Sure the Freys are open for hire and who better than the Tyrells to cut a deal to off the Army and Jaime. Leaving Cersi in the worst possible of situations to the delight of lady Olenna. After all she's already killed Cersis son Joffery and hates them with everything she has. This would leave the Lannisters with no army, no leader, no money and no power....would love to hear any comments thanks",7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/4pyl7z/no_spoilers_no_spoilers_season_finale_lannister/,2016-06-26 20:53:56

368,2b6qjz,Season 5 predictions?,"What are your predictions to what will happen in Season 5?

Mine are:

1. Tyrion Lannister is headed for the Wall. Why not meet up with Jon Snow and Stannis Baratheon? He just betrayed the Lannisters in the worst way possible, so it makes sense he’d head to people he might be of service to.

2. I know this is wishful thinking, but if Arya boarded a ship across the Narrow Sea, maybe she will….meet Daenarys? PLEASE? That would be so badass.

3. What’s fascinating about the end of this season is that, essentially, it’s really just Stannis and Tommen left. With Stannis at the Wall, I don’t think there’s going to be a huge quest for the Iron Throne, so I think Cersei is going to settle in as Regent to rule from King’s Landing.

4. WHERE THE FUCK IS RICKON. The forgotten Stark! How hilarious would it be if by the end of the show all the Starks are dead and Rickon just reappears and becomes king in the north. Okay, an actual prediction: We’ll find out where he is and what he’s been doing.

5. WE WILL SEE J’AQEN H’GHAR AGAIN. CALLING IT.

6. Oh, and Sandor Clegane obviously didn’t die. CALLING THAT, TOO.

7. Mance Rayder and the other wildlings will escape from captivity.

8. Hi, Jaime. Can we have a moment? I hated you. I did! And something happened during these last few seasons, and I find myself unbearably fascinated by your character. There’s a clear division between you and your sister, and I think you’ll exploit that, eventually betraying her, too. See, the Lannisters will finally fall apart after what they did to the Starks because sometimes, retribution takes a long time to happen.

9. GENDRY WHERE ARE YOU?

10. Samwell will lose his virginity to Gilly. I’m sort of feeling them as a couple?

377,2742lo,[S04E08] Too macabre?,"I love Game Of Thrones, as we do all, because it's raw and gritty. But I think maybe the last episode, in particular, when Oberyn's teeth get knocked out only to follow by his head exploding while he screams horribly might have been too much.

It's not so much that they killed him (which I expected when he started being really cocky, that just wouldn't happen in GoT with him winning afterwards), but the way they killed him. It felt way too macabre and horrific, downright depressing even.

Maybe it's because I've always had a fear of broken teeth, or... I don't know... just felt too much. Hearing the teeth bounce off the floor. Seeing his broken face smashed while he screamed.

388,29p77d,[Spoilers All / Speculation] What I think we'll see next season.,"Remember that scene where Jamie and Tyrion are discussing different types of deaths? The only one we hear but haven't seen is suicide. I think we have three likely candidates, based on the shit they've had to endure and feelings of hopelessness or powerlessness they're experiencing: Cersei, Jorah, and Jon. Jon will probably keep fighting out of a sense of duty if anything else, and Jorah seems to be in a forsaken spot but Tyrion and Varys are sailing east (I assume, maybe south) so they might be meeting up with him eventually. My money is on Cersei, literally everything is gone wrong for her and now it's her vs Margery and Ollena. I don't think she's smart enough to avoid further ego-punishing defeat. 

When Melisandre went to take Gendry from Thoros, she said to Arya (paraphrasing) ""I see darkness in your eyes. Blue eyes, brown eyes, green eyes-eyes you'll shut forever."" The darkness could be her drive to become a faceless (wo)man, with the different eye colors foreshadowing the faces she'll take. ""Eyes you'll shut forever"" could refer to the people she'll come to kill, but I think it might refer to her eyes, prophecy generally being misleading. I think Arya will come to die performing her work as an assassin, ""I see darkness in your eyes... eyes you'll shut forever."" No guess as to if she'll end up killing her targets or not. ""We will meet again"" is ominous, too. Perhaps Arya adds Melisandre to her list at some point for some reason, and dies trying to kill her?

Up North, I think Stannis will make the wise decision and work with the Wildlings to fight the White Walkers, bringing them below the wall. I imagine this will bring him into conflict with the Boltons. On one hand, Roose did kill the man he used blood magic to put a curse on, but Roose is pledged to Tommen so they'll probably be hostile to one another. Now, I hate to go too meta here and I do very much hate to say it but Stannis has stronger plot armor than Roose, so I imagine we'll see Roose die. Ramsey will be lord of the North, but will die to Theon/Reek. Stannis would possibly legitimize Jon Snow as a Stark, since he is a king, and maybe he has the authority to annul his Night's Watch vows.

Finally, I imagine Dany will get herself into no-win situations and sit around in Mireen.

409,bquosx,[SPOILERS] [S8E6] Sansa,"Besides the obvious poorly executed plot, I found issue with the way they treated Sansa at the end of the show. She was, at the very least, a factor in what happened to Danny. She showed Danny that the north would never love or follow her and she spilled Jon's secret, both of which helped to push Danny over the edge. Despite this, Jon seems to forgive her, even though she shows almost no remorse for her actions. On top of that, she seems power hungry and is the only person not to recognize Bran as the king, saying that she wants to rule over the north independently. Seems like if they would have chosen her to rule she would have been on board with it. IDK, her character towards the end of the show just bugged me.

410,b63389,The Highlights from the Bonus Material (not a spin-off) for GoT (HBO's interactive w/the cast for Live Action),"The highlights of the backstory with the main characters- who reprised their roles with voice acting- is at the end if you just genuinely prefer video, and want to skip ahead.

But this is more than that. This is a story of one misunderstanding, that deprived an entire fan base of the VR tour of a lifetime, with the actors and characters they love.

 I've been in the industry for 25 years (in addition to the degree) so I notice some things that normies don't. Like the fact that HBO crashed TellTale, and neither's marketing group made the save by explaining to fans that Game of Thrones was playable bonus material.   GoT wasn't a stand alone, or a spin-off. It was written with HBO, meant to offer fans (the sort of people who want fly out to visit the LotR set) a virtual tour.

 A behind the scenes look at what it was like to be \*there\* during the Great War.  It wasn't meant to give the player the gratuitous satisfaction of dropping Ramsay, or telling off Cersei. You literally couldn't change anything at all. It gave HBO fans a chance to talk to the characters they loved, in a world that was an addiction.  You can tour the Met, the Louvre- or Westeros,  experiencing the powerlessness of great events, sweeping you away. 

But unless you genuinely enjoyed the TV series, you were frustrated and didn't know why.  For instance- why can't you kill the Boltons? It's something gamers expect- but it isn't part of the premise. Watch it from a new perspective if you'd like:

411,6o5rii,My personnal Game of Thrones Theories,"Before reading this, these are personnal theories with only private interpretation, there is no reality or actual fact behind what is going to be said bellow. To my mind there is no spoil, I am new in the community so please excuse me if I didn't understand a rule. I try to write in respect of others without any spoil.

I have just recently openned a youtube channel on Game of Thrones in order tu publish some very personnal theories about the show - Among the theories I have, here a three : 

- Theory 1 : George R Martin said it himself, Game of Thrones is a mix between different periods of time and especially the war of the roses. When I see house Stark and the image in episode 1 when Ned discovers the little wolves close to their dead mother, I think of Romulus and Remus. The twin brothers were being fed and protected by a she wolf. They then grew to build rome before one decided to kill the other one. In a sense Jon and Sansa, siblings(officially and they were metaphorically fed by the same wolf) retook Winterfell and are rebuilding the north aren't they? Will one end up killing the other one?

- Theory 2 : The White Walkers are, I think more complex than they seem to be. There is no such thing as a 100percent evil person in game of thrones. When you go back in time, there was initially a pact between the first men and the children of the forest, magical beings. Why couldn't there have been a pact between the first men and the walk walkers? The first men couldn't have built the wall in any case and the children of the forest do not possess ice magic. So the wall is no more than a regular border created but the white lords to set boundaries in respect to a pact. But If the wall is the result of a pact, why did men agreed to tell themselves a lie for generation till they forget it's a lie? Little Finger said it himself, lies are what keeps a realm together, like the thousand blades of Aegon on the iron throne. It was necessary for everyone to think the with walkers were a threat, a danger that could emerged back at any time for the realm to stick together.  However, we still need to know what is driving them to attack the living, some condition in the pact must have been broken or the white lords are merely driven by conquest just like regular men. In any case, everyone is expecting an alliance between Jon and Daenarys against the white walkers, but what if the real threat is Daenarys? Jon is literally a dance of ice and fire, he possesses both Targaryan and first men's blood along with the magic, he is the bridge between two worlds, he was the mediator between the widlings and the men south of the wall, why wouldn't he work on a new pact with the white lords and unite the living and the dead against the real threat, the mad queen? This would be the perfect bitter sweet ending announced by George R Martin.

- Theory 3 : As the tittle of the book implies, game of thrones is a dance of ice and fire and this makes us focus all of our attention of the ice, namely Jon and the fire, Daenarys. But we then forget that game of thrones is ... well a game. The whole entire series revolves around two main characteres, Little finger and Varys. Everything that basically happened in Game of Thrones since the beginning was due to them, they started and ended wars, plotted countless time, have spies everywhere. Ned was not clever enough and was too wise to be a player, Tywin and Olenna are experienced and powerful but that doesn't make them players. Jon and Daenarys have basically everything, the blood, dragons and wolves, but they are not players. Little finger and Varys are, they are constantly opposed to one another, constantly opposed, one is doing everything for ""the good of the realm"" and the other one believes that ""chaos is a lader"". They are playing and by the end of season 6, one is with Jon, the ice, the other one, with Daenarys, the fire, they are literally dancing a song(tales) of ice and fire and I believe all the theories we know about game of thrones should be reconsidered in light of this special bound between these two guys.

I am working on these theories along with others to post them on my new youtube channel with animated videos. My channel is new(36h) with very little views and subscribers so I could really use your help to click and check it out, perhaps even share it if you can. 
I already have 5 videos on it, however my first theory video is due tomorrow night and I will be uploading one everyday. 

I have put alot of work into it and I intend to continu doing so and also excuse my accent, I am french but I do my videos in English. Here is the link to my page :

418,4m4wwb,When will see Dorne again???!!!,"Dorne storyline has not been favorable to fans and has been the worst story arc last year (even though I didn't mind it). We saw them in the premiere episode this year and it was a big twist as both Prince Doran and Trystane died rather quickly. I thought by now we would see where them already by now but I am now led to believe we will not see them again till episode 10. I read an article from a Reddit user (who's name I can't remember) who has said to have seen all of the episodes. He has been right about every episode so far without giving away to many spoilers on deaths or how it will end. In the article the Reddit user said that Dorne will not appear again until the last episode this year but did not go into detail in what way they would be shown. My theory is that we will see them possibly in the very last scene or next to the last scene welcoming Dany to Dorne so that she can start her conquering. Dorne has always been loyal to the Targaryens and Ellaria herself said no weak men will ever rule Dorne foreshadowing the return of Dany and giving her the power over Dorne or at least creating an alliance with them. I think that one or two of the sand snakes will appear in Meereen and tell Dany to land her ships and army in Dorne so that they can prepare for a attack against kings landing so she could hopefully end up on the iron throne. I obviously think there will be turmoil along the way as it is in every alliance we've seen in the show but it will end Danys story for preparation for next season. It will be so cool for Dany to be greeted by Ellaria and welcome her and her people to Dorne. It will make Dorne so much more interesting for next season and will tie in the Greyjoys, Targaryens, and Dornish. The two weaker stories of this season and last will instantly get a boost with Danys story.

Also, to add a twist - treating the characters like conkers, the killer of a another killer has their score added to his own e.g. Sansa (10) kills Hot Pie (5) to gain 6 (Hot Pie, plus the previous victims of his gravy flecked rage)

Poison and assisted murder score or share points. If Arya (7) and Sansa (16) join forces to murder Loras (3) they'd both gain 4 each.

Are there any named characters who haven't contributed to someone's death?

(GRRM is certainly the greatest killer, but he is as capricious as fate and as merciless as time)

425,35l2pw,Westerosi Pool Party,"My girlfriend found a picture of Ned Stark getting ready for Summer, complete with swimming trunks, floaties and surfboard. This escalated to a discussion on the role ducks should play in Westeros and how Stannis is basically Walter from The Big Lebowski.

Eventually, we got to thinking about a giant Westerosi pool party, where everyone managed to show up in their swimming gear, with duckie floaties, perhaps with some ice cold bevs and pool noodles. 

So, friends, comrades... I ask if anyone out there has the necessary artistic skill to create such a masterpiece, to match this vision. If you do, I humbly beseech you to use your creative genius for the powers of GOOD! To lend life to this vision of the best damn pool party this side of the Narrow Sea, where it will probably only take 5 minutes to turn the whole thing into a bloodbath!

Oh, by the way, I have a really good feeling about that Robb Stark chap. I can't wait for him to rescue his Dad.

440,bshj4g,[Spoilers] VERY long and detailed fan re-write of S08 E1-5,"Firstly, this is not my re-write. I'm in a Facebook fan group, and someone said that they did a very detailed re-write of those episodes and said if anyone was interested, to email him and he would send it. After I read it, I asked the writer if they had a webpage I could share it from, rather than his original email, so that he could get more eyes on it, and he told me he did not, but that he would be ok with me posting it on his behalf on Reddit (he approved me giving his real name, but I'm not sure as to what the sub's rules are for that, so until I get clarification on that, I'm going to hold off.)  It took me the better part of 20 minutes to read through, and there are some points that I didn't agree with, but it was very worth it.   I also think there is too much material in the episode 2-5 rewrites for only 4 episodes, and it would have to be broken into 5 or 6 episodes, but that has been a common complaint about this season.  The only edits I made to this were a few misspellings that stuck out (""Cersie"" to ""Cersei"", ""Viscerion"" to ""Viserion"" etc.)  I'm going to send the link to the post to the original author, who is working on a novel of his own, to enjoy and and all feedback.

# Episode 1 stands BUT

>Cersei doesn’t sleep with Euron because A). he’s Euron, a dollar store Jack Sparrow. He seriously acts and looks like he works at the Hot Topic in King’s Landing. As a whole, this character (as portrayed up to Episode 5 in Season 8 is basically a Jersey Shore cast member. As a writer, I will try to make him a Geoffrey / Ramsay level sicko, but drowning once clearly made him dumber than Hodor (who’s death I also promise to actually make mean something). B). that sub-plot about Cersei’s pregnancy never amounted to anything anyway (Bish stared out a window the whole season).  
>  
>I repeat. Euron does not smash in this episode.  
>  
>Cersei is not that ho. Oh, AND she gets her damn elephants when the Golden Company comes to Kings Landing.

&#x200B;

# Episode 2:

>Everything stands BUT  
>  
>Gendry outfits the Northern army with dragon glass weapons. He also presents Daenerys with armor for her dragons. In return, Daenerys publicly honors Gendry by making him the rightful Lord of Storm’s End.  
>  
>Tyrion, Jorah, & Varys all note how clever she is, slowly winning over the love of the Houses of Westeros.  
>  
>“I don’t have the love of the Starks,” says Daenerys.  
>  
>“But my Queen, what about Jon Snow?”  
>  
>Daenerys looks up and locks eyes with Sansa. She’s watching from the walls of the Winterfell castle like Littlefinger used to.  
>  
>Later that night, Arya makes love to Gendry (best night ever), and Gendry proposes to her afterward. “I’m a Lord now. If we survive the night. Will you marry me?” Arya kisses him but refuses. They share the same sweet moment where she tells him that she will never be a Lady.  
>  
>Podrick still sings a song like Pippin from ROTK, but the lyrics talk about Brandon the Builder who built the Wall to keep out the armies of the dead. After the song, Tyrion abruptly gets up and leaves the room.  
>  
>Jaime looks after him, “Where are you going? There’s still more wine.”  
>  
>Tyrion says that there’s someone he needs to talk to. He finds Bran in the Godswood, sitting under the weirwood tree. He comments on the Stark boy’s swagged out wheelchair and how it’s more elaborately crafted than the saddle Tyrion designed years ago. Bran is on that good weed, talking about how he likes to go back in time and watch people in history make big, baller moves.  
>  
>Tyrion sighs. “If I had that power I’d spend all my time watching old people fuck. Well... not old people. You know what I mean.”  
>  
>“That is why you do not have such power.”  
>  
>“Glad to see the Three Eyed Raven has a sense of humor.”  
>  
>“Why are you here, Tyrion?”  
>  
>“Oh, so you can’t read minds. I wasn’t sure.”  
>  
>“I only see into the past. Not the present or future.”  
>  
>“But you can change the past. Can’t you, Brandon?”  
>  
>... Bran gets real quiet.  
>  
>“Out of all the Starks I’ve reconnected with here at Winterfell, I’ve found you the most fascinating to observe. The way you just sit there, staring off into the distance. At first I assumed you were waiting for my brother at the gates, but even after you saw him, you just kept sitting there. Then I realized, you’re not really here, are you?”  
>  
>“It’s not a matter of where I am. It’s when I am.”  
>  
>“You went back in time and ordered the North to build the wall, didn’t you? The stories they tell about Brandon the Builder. That was you.”  
>  
>Bran’s dead ass quiet.  
>  
>“How?”  
>  
>“Deep down I knew it was me from the first time Old Nan read me that story.”  
>  
>“You wrote yourself into history.” Tyrion gets right in Bran’s face now. “Show me. I want to see what you see. Now. While there’s still time.”  
>  
>“Why?”  
>  
>“Because with my mind and your eyes we might just be able to survive the night.”  
>  
>Bran offers his hand. “What do you wish to see?”  
>  
>“Every time a dragon helped a Targaeryan win a war in Westeros.”  
>  
>Tyrion holds onto Bran. Their eyes roll back.  
>  
>Roll Credits

# Episode 3:

>Tyrion and Bran stand together, watching the Burning of Harrenhal and the Field of Fire from the Isle of Faces across the Lake, the God’s Eye. 3 dragons, Balerion, Vhagar, and Meraxes soar over the city, burning it to the ground. The castle walls explode.  
>  
>Tyrion is astounded. “I read about this battle in books as a boy.”  
>  
>Tyrion and Bran talk about the destructive power of dragons... and Targaeryans.  
>  
>“They say every time a Targaeryan is born, the Gods flip a coin,” says Bran.  
>  
>Tyrion catches the hint that Bran is suspicious of Daenerys. He turns around.  
>  
>“I’m assuming you watched my Queen’s rise to power.”  
>  
>“I watched her order her brother’s death, burn her enemies, and crucify slave owners.”  
>  
>“Have you watched what my sister has done?”  
>  
>That shuts Bran the fuck up.  
>  
>“If we survive the night it will be because of Daenerys and her dragons. She’s using her power to save your family. Considering everything the other houses of Westeros have stolen from the Starks, I would expect more gratitude from you. I believe she can be the ruler King’s Landing deserves.”  
>  
>“You’ve been wrong before.”  
>  
>That shuts Tyrion the fuck up.  
>  
>“I have watched all the Targaeryans rule. Daenerys is no more a just ruler than her father was.”  
>  
>“She’s not mad.”  
>  
>Tyrion blinks and suddenly he’s inside the Red Keep. He and Bran stand beside the Iron Throne where Aerys II, the Mad King, sits.  
>  
>It’s an expansion of the scene of Bran’s vision from Season 6 Episode 6. Tyrion watches his brother, Jaimie climb the steps to the iron throne, carrying his sword.  
>  
>Tyrion soaks in the cruelty of Aerys II’s presence.  
>  
>“BURN THEM ALL!” the Mad King shouts repeatedly. Slow at first, then so fast the 3 words blend into one. “Burnemall! Burnemall! Burnall!” Jaime slays Aerys. The King falls dead silent at the feet of his guard.  
>  
>“Tyrion, we have to go now,” says Bran.  
>  
>“Why? What’s happening?”  
>  
>“They are coming,” says Bran.  
>  
>“Who? The dead? But we haven’t found an answer yet on how to defeat them. We need more time to watch more battles.”  
>  
>“Nothing from the past can prepare us for what’s coming. The Night King has never ridden a dragon before.”  
>  
>“What can we do to stop him?”  
>  
>“Use our dragons against his.”  
>  
>Tyrion gasps as he returns to Winterfell. Suddenly, he’s back in the Godswood, holding onto Bran. He turns to see Theon and the Iron Born enter the sacred grove.  
>  
>Bran tells Tyrion to go to the crypts with Sansa. When they survive the night, he will show him more.  
>  
>After Tyrion descends into the crypts, Episode 3 starts as is. Everything up to the Dothraki charge stands. (It’s dumb, but it stands because it was still an amazing visual).  
>  
>But Bran isn’t useless in episode 3 anymore. When he tells Theon, “I have to go now,” he wargs into Jon’s dragon, Rhaegal, to help him kill wights as Theon and the Iron Born draw their arrows to protect him.  
>  
>Daenerys still takes off on her dragon after the Dothraki charge is wiped out. She rushes into the fight aback Drogon and starts torching fields of wights.  
>  
>As Rhaegal, Bran burns the fields of the dead. Jon rides on the dragon’s back as the White Walkers command a wall of fog to roll in and block the dragon’s view of the battlefield. Jon anxiously awaits the Night King’s arrival.  
>  
>Melisandre still lights the fire in the trenches just in time, EXCEPT the dead don’t just fall on the fire afterward to create a body bridge. By the rules of the show, the dead light up like torches whenever they touch fire. The fire trenches get put out when the White Walkers arrive at the front lines. (Oh yeah. We USE the white walkers in fact, we’re drawing our attention to a new 2nd in command General with some distinguishing facial feature who serves the Night King. Then the dead swarm the walls of Winterfell.  
>  
>Edd still dies saving Sam when the dead pour over the castle walls. Sam realizes he is WAY in over his head and runs for the crypts. He can’t make it that far before he’s forced into the Winterfell library. He takes shelter under a table and cries. (What a fuck).  
>  
>Brienne and Podrick both die. (Sorry. Not sorry.)  
>  
>Podrick is first to go. Brienne can’t save him and gets herself cornered attempting to rescue her squire. She tries to get back to Jaime, but the wooden ladder between them breaks and she can’t climb to higher ground. Jaime reaches down with his golden hand to save her. Brienne reaches up for Jaime as the dead drag her down. A White Walker sticks her in the back. The wights stab her legs. It’s clear that if she keeps holding on to Jaime they will both die. With the last of her strength, Brienne lifts herself up to steal a kiss from Jaime. She unbuckles his gold hand and falls into a pit of dead. (She dies a virgin... but still... she dies a knight.)  
>  
>Everything with Tormund stands. (If we can buy anyone standing on a pile of bodies, killing wights, it’s Milkdrinker).  
>  
>Everything with Greyworm and the Unsullied army also stands.  
>  
>Inside the castle, the Hound still suffers PTSD during the battle. He’s looking at the dead and at the fire, back to the dead and back to the fire... He’s about to give up.  
>  
>Beric shouts for Clegane’s attention, waking him from his reverie. Clegane is frozen by the fire. He tells Beric to fuck off and turns to flee. He runs into Melisandre. The red woman touches his face lovingly and says, “You who were kissed by fire at such a young age. The Lord of Light has chosen you.” Melisandre kisses the Hound.  
>  
>He pushes the Red Lady away and raises his sword, realizing it’s now ON FIRE.  
>  
>The Hound nearly drops his sword, but he doesn’t. Sandor Fucking Clegane holds it firmly, staring into the flames.  
>  
>“He chose you long ago, Sandor.”  
>  
>Beric calls out for the Hound. The Hound turns to see Beric pointing to Arya and Gendry, surrounded by a swarm of dead in the courtyard.  
>  
>The dead Giant still busts through the front gates and kills / is killed by a screaming Lady Mormont. (We all liked that part. Did you know that little actress can breakdance???).  
>  
>Anyways, Arya fights like a savage. Gendry gets impaled by a White Walker at the height of the battle. (All Men Must Die). Then Arya goes wild and starts killing ALL the White Walkers with the weapon Gendry designed for her. She’s about to be overrun in a massive gang up when fucking Sandor Clegane and Beric charge in swinging flaming swords. The Hound and Arya fight back to back against the dead in the courtyard, but the moment of triumph doesn’t last long. The dead are EVERYWHERE. Beric still gets stabbed like 8 times before he goes down.  
>  
>Nymeria’s pack of direwolves charge through the gates, smashed open by that dead giant. The wolves tear through the dead around Arya, The Hound, & Ser Berrick. Ghost joins in the fun. (Because we definitely didn’t just forget about him in that first Dothraki charge for budgeting reasons).  
>  
>The Hound manages to escape inside the castle, dragging Beric’s bloody body with him. Arya retreats after them. She calls out Nymeria’s name, but the direwolf doesn’t have time for a goddamn family reunion.  
>  
>Arya, The Hound, & a nearly-dead Ser Beric find themselves in the same chamber as Melisandre. Ser Beric dies (again), but Melisandre reveals that the Hound can now share the Last Kiss of the Lord of Light to resurrect Ser Beric like he once watched Thoros do. The Hound begrudgingly uses his magic to resurrect Ser Beric (again).  
>  
>Melisandre tells them both that the Lord of Light is not finished with them. (CLEGANEBOWL AIR HORNS SOUND). She turns her eyes to Arya and says, “He isn’t finished with any of you.” Melisandre still shares the same prophecy with Arya about her taking brown eyes, green eyes, & blue eyes.  
>  
>“What do we say to the God of death?”  
>  
>“Not Today.” Arya runs off to the Godswood to protect her brother Bran.  
>  
>Bran (still controlling Jon’s dragon via warg) is burning the army of the dead. As he does, he can see more dead giants and crazy dead bears and shit coming. Winterfell cannot be saved. Bran knows they are fucked.  
>  
>He wargs out of the dragon and comes back to the Godswood to see exactly how fucked Theon currently is. He calls out to him.  
>  
>“I know all that you’ve lost, Theon. But you’re a good man. Deep down. You always have been. I always considered you my older brother. You’re a Stark.”  
>  
>Theon: I fucking love you, Bran.  
>  
>Theon dies like Boromir defending Bran. He fights like he’s got nothing to lose. Except his limbs. He fights valiantly, but there’s like 10 White Walkers, not to mention General Icicle Beard. Theon is shredded.  
>  
>The White Walkers step on/over Theon toward Bran. All seems hopeless until Arya still leaps out of thin air and sticks the White Walker General with the pointy end. She still pulls that nifty drop stab move. The White Walker General shatters and with him a generous portion of the dead, but NOT ALL.  
>  
>What remains of the direwolf pack rushes into the Godswood to defend Arya and Bran.  
>  
>Daenerys is still knocked off her dragon, dodging ice spears chucked by White Walkers. (Thank goodness Gendry made dragon armor!) When she falls to the ground, surrounded by the dead, she’s still defended by Jorah until his dying breath.  
>  
>Meanwhile, things aren’t looking good for the Stark children. Bran commands Jon’s dragon to land in the Godswood where Arya and the direwolves are fighting off a dozen White Walkers. BOSS MODE.  
>  
>Jon’s dragon burns the White Walkers, catching fire to the weirwood tree. (Fuck Jon).  
>  
>Nymeria gets swarmed by the dead and so does Ghost. (I’m crying writing this).  
>  
>Arya knows it’s time to go. She lifts Bran out of his wheelchair, but she can’t quite drag him up onto the dragon with her.  
>  
>The direwolves are dead. The dead are still coming. Jon and Arya can’t get Bran on the dragon.  
>  
>Suddenly, Jaime Lannister is there to help push Bran onto the dragon’s back. The act costs Jaime his life. He gets gutted by White Walkers and Wights.  
>  
>The dragon takes off. Arya cries as she watches her childhood go up in flames. Jon admits “Winterfell has fallen.”  
>  
>Bran can’t bear to watch the weirwood tree burn. His eyes roll back in his head as he starts convulsing. He cries out to Jon. “Burn them all! Burn them all! Burn them all!”  
>  
>In his distress, he’s jumping throughout history.  
>  
>We see flashes of dragons. Red flames. Bran watches the Mountain burn the Hound’s face in the fire as a child. Green flames. Bran’s standing on Stanis’ ships as they are swallowed by dragonfire. He’s shouting inside the temple of the Sept of Bailor as It’s swallowed in green dragonfire. He watches Shireen, Stanis’ daughter, burn alive, and suddenly he’s the one burning at the stake. We see flashes of the Mad King sitting on the throne, shouting “Burn them all! Burn them all! Burnemall! Burnall! Burnall! Burnall!” Now Bran is sitting in the throne. Jaimie Lannister draws his sword. The Valyrian steel ignites on fire. The sword is plunged through the chest of the Mad King / Bran... and Bran’s body goes limp in Arya’s arms on the dragon.  
>  
>Arya screams for Jon’s attention. Jon makes an emergency landing south of the castle. He and Arya help pull Bran off the dragon. Bran now appears to be in a coma.  
>  
>Daenerys and Drogon torch the castle and the army of the dead inside and around it. At this point, it’s fish in a barrel.  
>  
>Tormund and Greyworm take cover inside the castle chambers as the walls blow up around them.  
>  
>The Starks lose Winterfell, but all the White Walkers get burned and the army of the dead is incinerated... WAIT... but where the hell are the Night King and Viserion?  
>  
>Meanwhile, in King’s Landing, Cersei is still trying to dodge Euron’s dick like a bullet, but he’s threatening to take away his fleet if she doesn’t give him some kind of twisted satisfaction.  
>  
>Cersei tells Euron she has a gift for him and to go to her room and wait. She checks in on Ellaria Sand, the former lover of Oberyn Martell who she left alive in prison to watch her daughter’s body rot.  
>  
>Cersei frees Ellaria and gives her to Euron. Ellaria has seen much better days but Euron’s into how freaky Cersei is. The Queen watches Euron tear into poor Ellaria with a sadistic smile. (Remember, she DID kill her daughter).  
>  
>A knock at the door interrupts the sadistic sexfest. Euron yells for whoever’s knocking to fuck off. It’s Qyburn. The hand needs to speak with the Queen.  
>  
>Cersei opens the door a little. “What is it?”  
>  
>Qyburn has real fear in his eyes.

# Episode 4:

>Ash falls like Winter Snow over King’s Landing. The Lannister Army roasts under blue flames. It’s a war zone on the ground. The civilian casualties are MASSIVE. (Dragons of Mass Destruction).  
>  
>The Scorpion’s decorating the walls of King’s Landing fire bolts that manage to pierce the dragon’s chest and head, but what is dead can never die (RIP Theon).  
>  
>The Night King lands his dragon and kills Lannister soldiers, then resurrects them to fight on his side.  
>  
>Viserion crashes through the roof of the Red Keep at the steps below lands the Iron Throne. (Roaring like the T-Rex at the end of Jurassic Park).  
>  
>The Knight King kills every guard who challenges him on his way up the steps to take a seat as King of Westeros. (Oooo....SHIT)  
>  
>In the midst of the chaos of the Night King’s attack, Ellaria tackles Cersei and tries to strangle her. Qyburn dispatches the Mountain to cut off Ellaria’s head. (It’s a mercy kill really).  
>  
>Qyburn organizes a secret escape for Cersei and Euron by boat with the Mountain’s protection. Euron promises to safely ferry Cersei to his fleet and sail her back to the Iron Islands. She has no choice but to follow him and flee the city. When Euron’s back is turned, Qyburn slips a vile of poison into Cersei’s hands and whispers “Should things turn out for the worst, my Queen. Your passing will be painless.”  
>  
>Parts of the Red Keep crumble as Cersei escapes. She can’t believe what’s happening. The Mountain takes the brunt of a few falling rocks that nearly crush Cersei and Euron. Qyburn isn’t so lucky. A piece of the ceiling falls and smashes his head in like a melon. Cersei screams.  
>  
>Euron pushes off into the sea in a row boat with Cersei and the Mountain. From a safe distance, they watch the Night King resurrect the dead Lannister armies and Golden Company to fight for him. Everything that Jon Snow and Daenerys warned Cersei about—the threat she considered too distant or unrealistic to worry about—ends up taking away everything she had (even her goddamn elephants! YES. That’s right. I said there are now zombie elephants in the story).  
>  
>Sansa and the northern forces emerge from the crypts in the dawn to discover Winterfell in ashes. Everything is dead. The white snow is torched black.  
>  
>Gilly, carrying baby Sam, finds Sam dead in the library. (No amount of plot armor can save you fat boy).  
>  
>Jon finds Sam’s body and realizes he died on top of a book. Gilly (who can read the book because Sam taught her how) gives it to Jon and Ser Davos. The pages are soaked in blood and describe, Lightbringer, a flaming sword prophesied to kill the Night King in the hands of Azor Ahai, the Prince who was promised. Ser Davos is all too familiar with the prophecy considering his history with Stanis and the Red Woman. He fills Jon in on the details and Jon says he read about Azor Ahai’s prophecy in a book passed down to him by Maester Aemon. Jon understands the last message his friend was trying to pass on to him. Sam believed Jon was the Prince that was Promised and that Longclaw, Jon’s sword, will become Lightbringer.  
>  
>Tyrion walks outside to discover Jaime dead in the Godswood. He finds his body charred from the waist down, but the top half is still forehead kissable. (Good night, Sweet Prince). Arya tells Tyrion that Jaimie died saving Bran. Tyrion cries.  
>  
>Tyrion tells the Stark sisters. “I only had one brother. He was the only one in my family who didn’t treat me like a monster.”  
>  
>Arya and Sansa look at each other and hug.  
>  
>Tyrion notices Bran is still in a coma type state after the weirwood tree burned. Arya waits until Tyrion finishes mourning Jaimie and then approaches his body. (We don’t see it, but you just KNOW she takes his face).  
>  
>Jon mourns Ghost, Sam, & Edd. He cries and tells Tormund, “Every brother I ever had in the Night’s Watch is dead.” Tormund holds Jon. He tells him. “We are brothers now.”  
>  
>Arya mourns Nymeria and Gendry. It’s rare to see her cry, but she sheds tears for Gendry.  
>  
>Sansa mourns Theon. Tormund looses his goddamn mind over Breanne. He cradles the big woman in his arms and ugly cries for an hour.  
>  
>Daenerys mourns Jorah.  
>  
>The Hound and Ser Beric use their fire swords to light pyres for the bodies that weren’t burned by dragon fire.  
>  
>Melisandre tells Beric that this will be his last life. She tells the Hound that the Lord of Light requires more service from him. When the time comes, he must use his gift again.  
>  
>“What about you, my lady?” asks Beric.  
>  
>Melisandre takes off her collar and walks naked into the winds of winter. Ser Davos still watches with a smile from the parapet as she collapses and dies.  
>  
>Daenerys, Tyrion, Varys, Greyworm, & Misandei assess the damage to their side. (The loss is about the same as in the show. 3/4 of the Dothraki are gone and about 1/2 the Unsullied).  
>  
>Daenerys wants what is left of the Northern forces to join her armies and march on King’s Landing to defeat Cersei’s army and secure the throne.  
>  
>Sansa is still like “bish, my men just fought the dead. They’re tired. Most are dead. We need to rally with the Knights of the Vale, Riverrun, Highgarden. The dead pose a threat to them all. We don’t have to fight this war alone, Daenerys. We can regroup and rearm.”  
>  
>“And the army of the dead will grow again,” says Jon.  
>  
>“And we’ll beat them again,” says Sansa.  
>  
>“Says the girl who spent the whole battle taking shelter in her family’s crypts.” (Daenerys goes full Real Housewives of Westeros)  
>  
>“We don’t all have dragons to fight for us.” Sansa looks at Jon.  
>  
>Daenerys is having a hard time staying patient with Sansa. Tyrion and Varys notice her temper brewing.  
>  
>Ser Davos interrupts the council after Bran awakens from his coma. Bran is wheeled in and tells everyone that the Night King has taken King’s Landing and raised a new dead army to defend it.  
>  
>Jon’s like “Fuuuck! See?!?”  
>  
>Bran also informs everyone that Cersei escaped the capitol with Euron and the Iron Fleet.  
>  
>But not ALL the Iron Fleet.  
>  
>Everybody looks at Bran like “WTF is this kid on?”  
>  
>Tyrion is the only one who figures out what Bran’s alluding to. “Yara Greyjoy.”  
>  
>“Yara has retaken the Iron Islands,” says Bran. (See? He’s actually a SUPER USEFUL FUCKING CHARACTER)  
>  
>“Send a raven,” Sansa orders. “If she can meet our people at the coast, she can ferry them to the Iron Islands where the dead will never reach them again.”  
>  
>“So that’s your war strategy? Run away?” Daenerys is not having it.  
>  
>“They are women and children.”  
>  
>“What about the Iron Throne?” asks Daenerys.  
>  
>Sansa stares daggers at Daenerys. “To hell with the Iron Throne.”  
>  
>Honor bound to his queen, Jon Snow wants to rush to march south with his Queen’s remaining army of Dothraki and Unsullied. He enlists the Northern armies and Tormund + the Wildlings to fight the dead (again) and save Westeros from Winter. (Typical fucking Jon Snow).  
>  
>Jon Snow still swears loyalty to Daenerys, despite Sam and Bran’s revelation that he is the rightful Targaeryan heir to the Iron Throne. He still says he doesn’t want it. Daenerys still asks Jon to hide his true identity to his family. Jon still promises Daenerys to keep the information between them secret, but still confesses it anyway to his family in the torched Godswood. (Ugh).  
>  
>Jon to Bran: “Tell them.”  
>  
>Bran: “Jon fucked his aunt.”  
>  
>Arya and Sansa still swear to keep it a secret and Sansa still plans to tell everyone. (Sansa is the new Littlefinger, y’all).  
>  
>After the reveal, Sansa and Arya meet in private. They both agree that Jon is being played (they’re also both grossed out by the Aunt thing).  
>  
>“It’s not really true what you said in the Godswood,” says Sansa. “The 4 of us aren’t the last of the Starks. Jon is a Targaeryan and Bran is... something else. It’s us Arya, you and me. We are the last of the Starks.”  
>  
>Arya nods. “I don’t trust the Dragon Queen. Just like I didn’t trust Littlefinger.”  
>  
>“I don’t trust Jon.” Sansa just HAD to say it. “I don’t trust him to take care of himself in King’s Landing. Men in our family don’t fair well in that city.”  
>  
>“I’ll watch over Jon,” says Arya. “And his aunt.”  
>  
>“I don’t trust anyone but you,” Sansa admits.  
>  
>Arya bows. “My Queen.”  
>  
>Tyrion is drinking again. Bronn busts in with the crossbow that Qyburn gave to him on Cersei’s behalf. The same crossbow Tyrion used to kill his father. He points the weapon at Tyrion.  
>  
>Tyrion still offers to pay Bronn more than Cersei to keep him alive. Bronn still obliges the idea. Tyrion still floats the prospect of making Bronn the Lord of Highgarden, but he wants something from Bronn in return.  
>  
>Tyrion and Bran share more adventures through time. Bran shows Tyrion how the Knight King was made by the Children of the Forest. Tyrion asks Bran why he doesn’t intervene and prevent this whole mess from ever happening.  
>  
>Bran tells Tyrion that’s not how it works.  
>  
>“Well then how in seven hells did you get them to build the wall?”  
>  
>Tyrion opens his eyes. It’s now winter. He stands alone in the snow. He looks around and discovers a huddle of the First Men gathered around a cave wall. Bran stands apart from the huddle. His eyes are rolled into the back of his head.  
>  
>He’s warging into one of the First Men, controlling his movements as he carves frantically into the stone, surrounded by a huddle of other First Men.  
>  
>“Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!” The first man repeats the words under his breath as Bran speaks them aloud. Tyrion watches the mental connection of warging through time exhausts the First Man until he collapses into mumbles, shouting “Bildall! Bildall! Bildall” after drawing a huge rock carving of The Wall depicting a barrier between white Walkers and men to show his tribe members.  
>  
>“You can warg into men in the past,” notes Tyrion with disbelief.  
>  
>Bran’s eyes return to normal. “It comes with a cost.”  
>  
>Tyrion looks at the First Man thrashing on the floor like a fish out of water. “Bildall! Bildall! Bildall!”  
>  
>“I disable whoever I possess in the past. I drive them Mad,” says Bran.  
>  
>It takes Tyrion a second, but then he realizes what Bran is actually saying. He looks back at the First Man shouting “Bildall!” and says...  
>  
>“Burn them all. Burnemall. Burnall” He looks up at Bran in disbelief. “It was you.”  
>  
>Bran knows he fucked up. He won’t look Tyrion in the eyes.  
>  
>“So are the Targaeryans really mad? Or is it you?”  
>  
>“The moment appeared in my head when I asked Jon to burn Winterfell. I couldn’t help it.”  
>  
>“Considering all the power you have, you think you’d be of more help to the living. You still haven’t shown me how we can defeat the Night King.”  
>  
>At last, Bran breaks his silence. “There is a prophecy. Do you know the name Azor Ahai?”  
>  
>Tyrion nods. “The Prince who was Promised.”  
>  
>“It doesn’t have to be a prince,” says Bran. “The prophecy never implies gender. I remember looking up at the sky as a boy and seeing a red comet glow like a star in the sky. That was the night Daenerys was reborn from the fire with 3 dragons.”  
>  
>Tyrion gets mad chills. He knows EXACTLY where this is going now.  
>  
>Overcome by mounting impatience, Daenerys orders her forces (Greyworm, Missandei, & Varys) to sail for Dragonstone with her Unsullied armies to regroup and prepare for the siege of King’s Landing. She. wants. that. throne. bitch.  
>  
>Tyrion speaks with Daenerys after his vision quest with Bran. He explains to his Queen that it is in their interest to protect and shelter the Three Eyed Raven.  
>  
>Daenerys: uhh... Isn’t that weirdo a walking GPS for the Night King? (Oh poor choice of words Dany).  
>  
>“That’s why we must take care of him. The Three Eyed Raven is too precious to lose to the enemy. His gifts are incredible.”  
>  
>“The boy’s a cripple. How do you propose we keep him on the move, out of the enemy’s hands?”  
>  
>Tyrion smiles. You know this little mf is up to something.  
>  
>Bran Stark travels east in a horse carriage. Bronn holds the reigns, heading toward the coast.  
>  
>“Highgarden, you say?” says Daenerys.  
>  
>“A small price to pay for keeping the Three Eye Raven and myself alive.”  
>  
>“What does a Three Eyed Raven do?”  
>  
>“The Stark boy has shown me things. Things that can help me strategize on your behalf, to ensure you not only win the battle for King’s Landing, but the Great War.”  
>  
>“Tell me.”  
>  
>Tyrion asks If Daenerys has ever heard of the prophecy of Azor Ahai. She shakes her head.  
>  
>Tyrion recites the prophecy. “There will come a day after a long summer when the red stars bleed and the cold breathe of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire with a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.”  
>  
>Tyrion indicates that Daenerys COULD Be the Princess that was was Promised. “From smoke and salt you were born to make the world anew. You can triumph over darkness and bring about an unending summer if only you can forge Lightbringer and kill the Night King. If you make death bend the knee, you’ll bring peace to the Seven Kingdoms and be beloved by the people of Westeros. All those who die fighting for your cause shall be reborn.”  
>  
>Tyrion has Daenerys’ attention. “How does one become Azor Ahai?”  
>  
>“You need to forge a sword,” explains Tyrion.  
>  
>“I have two dragons,” says Daenerys. “I don’t need a sword.”  
>  
>Tyrion nods. “Yes, but the fulfillment of the prophecy requires something else you don’t have.”  
>  
>“And what is that?” asks Daenerys.  
>  
>“The Lord of Light’s blessing.”  
>  
>Before he leaves the North, Tyrion says goodbye to Sansa. She still tells Tyrion the secret of Jon’s lineage before he sails south to King’s Landing.  
>  
>Tyrion doesn’t swallow the news well. He starts drinking AS SOON as he finds out and lets it slip to Varys before the Spider sails south with the Unsullied to Dragonstone. Varys is sending out ravens all the way home.  
>  
>Meanwhile, Daenerys goes to Jon before the Northern armies ride south to Winterfell and asks for him to come with her. Jon asks where. Arya joins the conversation, observing Jon is getting suckered. Daenerys tells Jon and Arya that Tyrion has been vision-questing with Bran and now she knows a way to kill the Night King—a sword called Lightbringer. She knows how they can make it. Daenerys and Jon must travel to the God’s Eye together on their dragons. Jon is all about the mission. Arya is giving Jon the side eye. Jon dismisses Arya’s warning and tells Arya to ride south with the Northern armies, then meet him and Daenerys at the God’s Eye after they have Lightbringer.  
>  
>Jon leaves Tormund and Ser Davos in charge of overseeing the Northern army and Wildling’s march south to King’s Landing. The Targaeryans hop on their dragon’s and fly south towards the Riverlands.  
>  
>The Hound and Sansa share an intimate goodbye before the Hound leaves to ride south with Beric to King’s Landing. The Hound tells Sansa that she’s not the same little bird he once knew. He tells her that if she had left King’s Landing with him, then it would have all been different. She would have never been abused by Geoffrey, Littlefinger, or Ramsay. Sansa kisses Sandor Clegane on the cheek. She tells him “Do you know what the difference is between me and everyone else who wants the Iron Throne? I know how to move on. I let go of Geoffrey, I let go of Littlefinger, and I let go of Ramsay. What they did to me in the past does not define who I am today. I am not a victim. I’m a survivor.” (Sansa does NOT say that all the rape and abuse made her into the strong woman she is today. Frankly, that logic is revolting and shows how little the writer’s actually understand or value women).  
>  
>Sansa leaves with the women and children who survived the Battle of Winterfell to meet Yara’s boats on the west coast and see them off safely to the Iron Islands.  
>  
>Bran awaits Tyrion on a smuggling frigate. Bronn and a small crew prepare to disembark.  
>  
>“I’ve never left the North before,” says Bran.  
>  
>“It’s not so bad,” Arya answers, appearing suddenly among the crew members. “I sailed to Bravos once.”  
>  
>“I know. I’ve watched you grow up sister. I know I wasn’t there, but I’ve seen what you went through to become no one. The many face you’ve worn.”  
>  
>Arya’s insistent. “Vhalar Morgulus.”  
>  
>Bran looks at the horizon. “I won’t tell you where Cersei is.”  
>  
>“She killed our father, Bran.”  
>  
>“I know. I don’t want to lose you too.”  
>  
>“So you’d rather I ride south to fight the dead and die in a battle that was never mine to begin with? I don’t care about killing the Night King. That’s never been my fight. I want Cersei.”  
>  
>“And I hope you get her,” says Tyrion, arriving at the ship, clearly drunk. “For my sake and yours, and when you drive that needle through my dear old sissy’s heart, do tell her the Lannisters send their regards.”  
>  
>Arya stares at Tyrion. “You know her better than anyone.”  
>  
>“No. That would be Jaime.”  
>  
>“Jaime’s dead,” says Arya. Tyrion’s eyes gloss at the reminder. “Tell me where she’s going.”  
>  
>“To hell,” says Tyrion. He looks up at Bronn. “Are we ready to set sail?”  
>  
>“Tell me why I’m doing this again,” says Bronn.  
>  
>“When Daenerys is Queen. She will make you Lord of Highgarden.”  
>  
>“Right.” Bronn shrugs. “Where we sailing to?”  
>  
>“Nowhere sounds as good as anywhere” says Tyrion. He looks back at Arya, who looks severely put out. He shrugs.  
>  
>“If I was Cersei I would fall back to Dragonstone and snatch the island out from under Daenerys.” He toasts his glass to Arya. “Happy?”  
>  
>Arya steps off the boat onto the dock and climbs back on her horse.  
>  
>Meanwhile at sea, Varys is throwing out the spider signal to every major house in Westeros, revealing the truth of Jon Snow’s heritage. That’s when Euron’s Iron Fleet (who everyone assumed would have already dipped back to the Iron Islands) ambushes Danaery’s army at Dragonstone. Euron destroys the Dragon Queen’s ships. Cersei relishes it. (Switch Tyrion’s perspective with Varys.) Missandei is still captured by Euron and Cersei. Euron retreats to the Iron Islands. Everyone still washes up on Dragonstone BUT Euron never kills Rhaegal with that lucky shot from a mile away.  
>  
>Jon and Daenerys land their dragons on the Isle of Faces, inside the lake known as the God’s Eye. They leave their dragons and approach a grove of weirwood trees. (This forest is creep level 3000)  
>  
>The trees grow in a spiral pattern, similar to the Dragon sigil of the Targaeryan House and the spiral patterns that the dead took the time to nail to the wall with dead bodies in Castle Black.  
>  
>Jon sees tree and wall carvings of green men and green children.  
>  
>Jon asks Dany, “What is this place?”  
>  
>“Tyrion told me the Isle of Faces was where the pact between the Children of the Forest and the First Men was made. The War ended here. It is the most powerful vortex of magical energy in Westeros.”  
>  
>Jon examines all the faces carved and painted into the white weirwood trees long ago by the Children of the Forest.  
>  
>Daenerys confronts Jon about his betrayal. She knows he broke his promise, disobeyed his Queen, and told his family the truth about having Targaeryan blood, jeopardizing their entire future together. Sansa told Tyrion who told Daenerys.  
>  
>Jon draws his sword and offers it to Daenerys. “Let’s do what we came to do.” He swears he is still loyal to Daenerys. He swears he doesn’t want the throne. He only cares about defeating the dead.  
>  
>Jon bends the knee and holds up Longclaw. He stammers through an apology. Daenerys takes Jon’s sword, bows down and silences him with a long kiss, but Jon can’t hold the connection. (Too incesty). When he pulls away, Daenerys seizes the opportunity to pierce Jon through the heart with Longclaw, right through the chest. She chooses to be feared rather than loved in Westeros. She kills Jon because he’s a threat to her throne (NOT just because he rejects her sexually).  
>  
>Daenerys tells Jon that he was resurrected by the Lord of Light so that she could drive the sword through his living heart, just as Azor Ahai once did to his love, Nissa Nissa. A part of Jon’s soul merges with the sword to turn Longclaw into Lightbringer.  
>  
>The sword glows fiery red in Daenerys hands.  
>  
>“Your blood may be Targaeryan, but you are not a dragon.”  
>  
>Jon Snow falls at Daenerys feet and DIES (again). Daenerys leaves his body on the Isle of Faces and flies to Dragonstone with both her dragons.

Against Ramsay, the Stark side decided to keep on the defence because they had half the numbers as the Boltons. But when Rickon got killed, Jon Snow just forgot the whole plan and charged like an immortal God towards the enemy. Thanks to magically appearing Littlefinger they survived the slaughter and got to live. After the battle why didn't anyone question Jon Snow about this? Nobody gave a shit! Are all Northmen dumb?

476,1gdb6o,[Season 3 Spoilers] Jon Snow and Ned Stark's honor,"Something has been itching in my head the last couple of days. From what we've heard, Jon Snow was an infant Ned Stark brought home to Winterfell after Robert's rebellion. Jon was a baby Ned supposedly had gotten with woman outside his marriage, but we are never told who she was (are we?). 

Does this cheating fit with Ned Stark's sense of honor and dignity? He just doesn't seem like the guy who would cheat on his wife, even though he was not the one she was supposed to marry. I don't know. He did make mistakes in Season 1, so perhaps he made a few mistakes earlier too. Still... what if Jon Snow was not his son, but someone else's? It would have to be someone important that he wanted to protect and hide the identity of. A King's bastard, perhaps? Or someone from a family which was no longer allowed to live? Jon's not blonde, so I'm guessing it would be impossible for him to be Targaryen or Lannister.

Maybe I'm really reaching for something that isn't there. It just seems so misfitting with regards to Ned's character.",39,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/1gdb6o/season_3_spoilers_jon_snow_and_ned_starks_honor/,2013-06-15 03:02:16

I think it is pretty probable that they will show up again. My guesses are:

1) Dario will either betray Dany and leave Mareen, and maybe join in with some enemy of Dany. Or will get killed by the masters (i don't think they would just give up, since Dany with her armies and Dragons left)

2) Jorah will probably find the cure and come back. I saw some people saying that he will probably find his way to the Citadel and help Sam unlock the secrets of Valyrian stell. That could be true, what I know is that he is going to back by Dany's side and I think he will be half covered in greyscale.

485,36mzud,[S05E06] Why are critics/viewers so disgusted over the last scene?,"Seriously.

Dozens of characters have died from decapitation, torture or by being burned alive. Oberyn and Theon with arguably the worst cases. The show is full of incest, slavery and cannibalism. It was obviously not made for the sensitive types.

It was expected of psychopathic Ramsay to do a lot of fucked up shit. Nobody batted an eye when we found out Ramsay would slaughter past girlfriends if he got 'bored' of them (e.g. scene of that girl getting shot with a bow and mauled by his dogs).

But then suddenly this one scene crosses the line? What?

If people are complaining about this, then why not complain about the rape scene in Season 1? I mean, wasn't Daenerys technically raped by Khal Drogo? She obviously didn't want to marry/fuck him at the time, but she was forced. Did nobody find that rape scene a little odd?

490,bnlvif,[SPOILERS] Theory: John is Basically Already Dead,"I noticed in episode 4 when thormund pats Jon , Jon clutches his chest.  now that might be just because thormund is a big f***er. But the way they filmed it seemed deliberate. I think maybe the Lord of lights magic that was keeping Jon alive from his stab wounds will die out now that if the night king is dead. John has served his purpose. I don't think he'll die until after episode 5 but it is definitely a possibility he doesn't seem to have much stake in this fight with cersi. this could also be why ghost was sent back to the wall since that is and should be the actual resting place of Jon. Also rhaegal died and rhaegal was jons dragon. None of the Starks or the targaryens ""pets"" have died until there human either died or stopped being an honorable Stark/Targaryen. Obviously Jon is the definition of honor. I think John is a Dead Man walking and could literally die at any moment.  
Also Jon is with davos and davos would understand what is happening when Jon collapses. 
It's also possible that rhaegals death parallels jons where Jon's stab wounds slow him down on the battlefield and he gets killed.
