55,bxqei8,[NO SPOILERS] Director Jeanie Finlay on her ‘Game Of Thrones’ documentary ‘The Last Watch’,"I thought her comment about the petitions was graceful and on point. 

&#x200B;

“The petition for me just shows the fans care. And I feel like people should be able to express what they think about the show. So if you want to set up a petition go for it, or if you want to complain about the show go for it. *Game of Thrones* is about the show, but is also about the **community who love the show** and feel passionate about that. There’s also going to be strong opinions so I sort of think that it’s OK for people to express their passion, in whatever form that takes.”

### And I guess a little bit is people not wanting to say goodbye?

“It could be, it’s hard to say goodbye. If you love something it’s hard to let go, **and sometimes you’re meanest to the person you love the most!”**

77,bu1p8c,[SPOILERS] Dear Everyone Who Hated the Game of Thrones Finale,"I didn’t hate the ending to Game of Thrones. I didn’t love how everything happened. But I don’t disagree with the outcome.

Let me start by saying the show WAS rushed. This could’ve been seasons longer — not just episodes longer. Some things remain unclear. For that, I too have frustrations. It definitely wasn’t perfect (see: Starbucks cup and water bottle). Most fans’ pain points are focused on the fact that things weren’t “explained.” I can see that. But I’m also the psycho who kind of likes the fact that things weren’t spelled out perfectly. Some things were open to our own interpretation.

Since Sunday night, I’ve seen angry texts, tweets and posts questioning things that happened (or didn’t happen)—including questions that I thought there were clear answers to. So, right or wrong, I wanted to give some insight from someone who didn’t absolutely hate the ending.

&#x200B;

**“Dany fought for 8 seasons and became one of our favorite characters for absolutely nothing.”**   
No. Dany fought for 8 seasons to get to where she is today so that we could fall in love with her character. Just like Jon fell in love with her. The writers wanted us to respect all the good she has done in this world. They wanted us to WANT her on the throne — so that we could feel as much emotion as we did when she died. We were supposed to be just as torn as Jon was.

&#x200B;

**“Why would there be a Night’s Watch if the white walkers are gone?”**   
There isn’t. The show ended with all of the wildlings leaving the wall behind them. Jon is king of the free folk. Brandon put him in the “true north” where he belongs.

&#x200B;

**“Jon being a Targaryen doesn’t matter.”**   
A). In a show where power and family names rule all of Westeros, Jon didn’t want it. He never wanted any of it. The one true heir to the iron throne was the very person who wanted it least. That’s essentially what the entire show is about. He had to secretly be someone with power to make that message clear to viewers.   


B). Dany finding out Jon was Targaryen was the tipping point in going mad. She realized she could never be loved as a leader like he is… even though he pledged his allegiance.

&#x200B;

**“What happened to the prophecy?!”** 

Azor Ahai killed his love to save the world. Jon was brought back to life to kill Dany, the woman he loved, to save the entire world from destruction.

&#x200B;

**“So there were no green eyes?”** 

Little Finger had green eyes. For people complaining that Arya didn’t kill Cersei, I don’t think there’s anything more cliche than her saying for 6 seasons she’s going to kill the queen… and having it play out perfectly. I’ll take realistic over predictable.

&#x200B;

**“Bran said: I’m the three-eyed raven now. I can’t be Lord of Winterfell. Now he’s suddenly saying: What do you think I came all the way here for?”**   
Bran says this when the entire world is against them. He says this before they wiped out the entire army of the dead and before they took down Cersei and King’s Landing. Obviously a LOT has changed since then. Just because he says “what do you think I came all the way here for” also does not mean he necessarily “wants” it. He is saying he understands that this is his purpose, and he’s ready to fill it.

&#x200B;

**“Tyrion is a literal prisoner. How is he determining the fate of who rules?”**   
As a side note, I hated this little circle pow-wow they all had. Not who they chose, but HOW they chose could’ve been better. BUT. There is not currently a ruler or anyone in power because the queen died. Tyrion was the hand of the queen. He has power by default and the least people can do is listen.

&#x200B;

**“How does Bran have the best story out of everyone?!”**   
I don’t think this is meant to be taken so literally. Bran is the world’s memory. He represents all people in the realm. He has the best story because he has ALL the stories.

&#x200B;

**“How do you pick Brandon Stark — someone who sat there doing absolutely nothing all series — for the throne.”** 

And here is my aha moment: I think this is literally the point of the entire show.

Since the beginning we are conditioned to believe that it’s about the lengths people will go to sit on the iron throne. But over the course of 8 seasons, we see what power, greed and selfishness can do in the hands of the wrong people. Even some of our favorite characters. Because of this, we slowly start learning that the throne is not actually all it’s cracked up to be. In fact, the throne itself is the problem. Hence Drogon burning it. We also learn that maybe the best rulers are the ones who don’t want to rule. And this journey of what we thought was always a quest for power, suddenly becomes far more than that: it becomes a search for purpose. This turn of events is called irony. And the show has ALWAYS been about irony.

**An unwanted bastard being the true heir to the iron throne.**  
**A rejected imp becoming hand of the queen.**   
**Dany becoming the father she swore she’d never become.**   
**Cersei’s precious “red keep that has never fallen” being what crumbles and kills her.**   
**Arya, who has assumed other identities all her life, sailing away under a huge Stark banner.**   
**Bran, the one person to never care about greed, power or ruling, being the ONE person to have it all in the end.**  
 **A show about the importance of a throne actually being about its undeniable pitfalls.**

Call me crazy. But to me, there’s nothing more fitting than this ending.

Sure, the predictable, happy-go-lucky, Jon-and-Dany-rule-together sounds great. But that’s NOT Game of Thrones. It’s never been. And don’t get me wrong—all of our fan theories are more than entertaining. But just because they didn’t happen, doesn’t give the show any less of an awe factor.

“The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.” That’s what it’s always been about: the Starks.

Was it perfect? Not in the slightest. Could they have done more? Yes. Do I think there were things left unexplained? Of course. But I think it’s so impressive what they’ve done with this story since the beginning. A character I would go to war for might be someone you would kill. The ending I’ve been pulling for might be the opposite of what you hoped to see. The writers allowed us to connect with different characters, feel different emotions, want different things… all from the same show. Regardless of what we agree and disagree on… This has been so fun to follow for the past 8 seasons.

I hope fans can eventually get the bad taste of this last season out of their mouths. I also hope fans find what they’re looking for in GRRM’s book, which we now know will be slightly different than the show. But despite its imperfections, I’ll be appreciating everything Game of Thrones has given us in the meantime: one hell of a good story.

86,btagt5,[SPOILERS] I signed the rewrite petition. Here’s why and how I thought the season could be better. #2,"Episode 4 and 5

If Episode 3 was a betrayal by plot structure, than these episodes are a betrayal by character development. That’s not to say that I don’t think the characters went in viable directions per say. 

Daenerys turning into her father as the Mad Queen was interesting and different in a good way. Flipping the script to have Cersei become the victim and Daenerys as the villain is another interesting idea but the execution was poor. More specifically, there wasn’t enough build up to this switch. In fact, there was basically none. 

Now, some people might point to the number of times Daenerys has executed somebody by dragon fire, or the number of killing sprees she’s backed as early signs of her cruelty; and I agree with you. Nobody said she was perfect or a pushover, but her cruelty and mercilessness has always been for a purpose. 

One singular purpose, in fact, that has defined her character since she was first introduced: Empowerment. Every move she has made has either empowered herself, others, or eliminated an obstacle to universal empowerment. The Breaker of Chains values life, and she wants all of it to be treated equally. 

We’ve seen her waver, but she’s always stayed true to this singular focal point. This also happens to be the development strategy that has built up every major character in this show. 

Don’t believe me? Let’s go through some of the characters. Sansa has been about growing out of naivety. In season one, she was basically a princess, totally oblivious about the real world. Circumstances in the show, however, have (rather brutally) forced her to grow up and now we have the fierce don’t-touch-me-or-I’ll-feed-you-to-your-own-dogs Sansa we all know and love. 

Jaime has been about redemption. First, it was overcoming his title as the back stabbing King-slayer, and later it was about making up for all the harm he did while he was at Cersei’s side. 

Arya has been about finding your own path. She was supposed to be a lady, but she wanted to be a warrior. She was supposed to help take care of Winterfell after Ned died, but she wanted revenge and became an assassin. Men are supposed to court her but she tells them to shut up and lie down.

Characters embodying simple and predictable mantras are placed into chaotic circumstances to see how they respond. It’s a great strategy, but what’s critical to making it work is that while the circumstances may change rapidly, the characters must change slowly. The entertainment and realism comes from us being able to watch characters slowly evolve as their understanding of their mantra changes. 

In episode 3, Daenerys embodied her mantra more than she ever has before. She literally empowered all life in Westeros with her army to fight against death itself. 

Seven whole seasons were dedicated to this achievement. 

Two episodes later, though, she is the antithesis of universal empowerment, burning tens of thousands of innocent people to death to achieve her own selfish ends. Now, it’s not like this couldn’t happen, but you can’t change the core of a character in two episodes and expect it to be believable. 

“But Sand, two of her best friends and her dragon died!” You’re right, Missandei, Jorah, and Rhaegal did die, rather cruel deaths at that, but let’s think about what Daenerys has been through. 

When we first met her, her entire family, except for her brother, had been slaughtered. That same brother regularly abused her before selling her off as an unwilling bride. Unsurprisingly, she was raped as an unwilling bride, but still managed to find love for her rapist. Then, shocker! He almost died too! In an effort to save his life she lost her unborn child, only to have to kill her now borderline comatose husband herself; and that’s just one season. Your telling me all of that didn’t knock her off her focal point, but in the span of two episodes the death of two friends and a dragon will? That doesn’t seem right.

Cersei faces the same issue. We’ve been primed, slowly and meticulously, to understand that Cersei is a force to be reckoned with. An unstoppable typhoon of political intrigue that only shows mercy for her children. But in the span of just ONE episode (really more like half of it) we’re supposed to suddenly feel sympathetic toward her and think that she’s a victim? I’d wager I wasn’t the only one rooting for the caved in ceiling when she met her end. 

Worse yet, it’s not just these two whose character development took a wild turn. I think that almost every character in this episode reverted to the worst forms of themselves. Jaime was on the road to redemption! He’d found a relationship with a nice, non-psychotic woman! And then he leaves her to go back to Cersei and die together with her? The single most corrupting force in his life?! 

Speaking of that lovely non-psychotic woman why’d they have to treat Brienne like that? She was Sir Brienne of Tarth at long last. The title that every man in patriarchal Westeros told her she could never have. She had proven, without a doubt, that no man could hold her back. 

At least, until the end of episode 4, when she finally trusts a guy and then he stomps down her confidence and leaves her crying. Never mind the fact that she’s one of the strongest fighters in Westeros, and was a commanding officer in the fight against death itself. Her man is gone! Now she has nothing!

I mean, they really put down powerful woman in these episodes, and on a whim it seems. Daenerys was the most powerful person on the planet, the defender of all life! Now, she’s emotionally unstable and insane? Cersei was the second most powerful person on the planet and she died suddenly overcome with emotion. Totally helpless as she pleaded for a man not to let her baby die, because obviously she can’t do anything herself right? She’s just the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. Missandei was arguably the third most powerful woman (woman, not person, because I think Tyrion has more authority than her) on the planet and she died back in chains. Way to show women their place guys! 

Oh wait… it’s 2019. 

Now, I’m not saying this was the intention of the writers, (I highly doubt that it was) but considering that every other instance of misogyny has been associated with a villain and then eliminated cruelly by a powerful woman, it’s a little off-putting.

Moral of the story here is that even if you have a cool idea to spice up a story you can’t just bend characters into it and think that it’ll work out. You gotta respect character development and TAKE IT SLOW, otherwise the story just won’t make sense.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/btagt5/spoilers_i_signed_the_rewrite_petition_heres_why/,2019-05-26 21:16:54

94,bshj4g,[Spoilers] VERY long and detailed fan re-write of S08 E1-5,"Firstly, this is not my re-write. I'm in a Facebook fan group, and someone said that they did a very detailed re-write of those episodes and said if anyone was interested, to email him and he would send it. After I read it, I asked the writer if they had a webpage I could share it from, rather than his original email, so that he could get more eyes on it, and he told me he did not, but that he would be ok with me posting it on his behalf on Reddit (he approved me giving his real name, but I'm not sure as to what the sub's rules are for that, so until I get clarification on that, I'm going to hold off.)  It took me the better part of 20 minutes to read through, and there are some points that I didn't agree with, but it was very worth it.   I also think there is too much material in the episode 2-5 rewrites for only 4 episodes, and it would have to be broken into 5 or 6 episodes, but that has been a common complaint about this season.  The only edits I made to this were a few misspellings that stuck out (""Cersie"" to ""Cersei"", ""Viscerion"" to ""Viserion"" etc.)  I'm going to send the link to the post to the original author, who is working on a novel of his own, to enjoy and and all feedback.

# Episode 1 stands BUT

>Cersei doesn’t sleep with Euron because A). he’s Euron, a dollar store Jack Sparrow. He seriously acts and looks like he works at the Hot Topic in King’s Landing. As a whole, this character (as portrayed up to Episode 5 in Season 8 is basically a Jersey Shore cast member. As a writer, I will try to make him a Geoffrey / Ramsay level sicko, but drowning once clearly made him dumber than Hodor (who’s death I also promise to actually make mean something). B). that sub-plot about Cersei’s pregnancy never amounted to anything anyway (Bish stared out a window the whole season).  
>  
>I repeat. Euron does not smash in this episode.  
>  
>Cersei is not that ho. Oh, AND she gets her damn elephants when the Golden Company comes to Kings Landing.

# Episode 2:

>Everything stands BUT  
>  
>Gendry outfits the Northern army with dragon glass weapons. He also presents Daenerys with armor for her dragons. In return, Daenerys publicly honors Gendry by making him the rightful Lord of Storm’s End.  
>  
>Tyrion, Jorah, & Varys all note how clever she is, slowly winning over the love of the Houses of Westeros.  
>  
>“I don’t have the love of the Starks,” says Daenerys.  
>  
>“But my Queen, what about Jon Snow?”  
>  
>Daenerys looks up and locks eyes with Sansa. She’s watching from the walls of the Winterfell castle like Littlefinger used to.  
>  
>Later that night, Arya makes love to Gendry (best night ever), and Gendry proposes to her afterward. “I’m a Lord now. If we survive the night. Will you marry me?” Arya kisses him but refuses. They share the same sweet moment where she tells him that she will never be a Lady.  
>  
>Podrick still sings a song like Pippin from ROTK, but the lyrics talk about Brandon the Builder who built the Wall to keep out the armies of the dead. After the song, Tyrion abruptly gets up and leaves the room.  
>  
>Jaime looks after him, “Where are you going? There’s still more wine.”  
>  
>Tyrion says that there’s someone he needs to talk to. He finds Bran in the Godswood, sitting under the weirwood tree. He comments on the Stark boy’s swagged out wheelchair and how it’s more elaborately crafted than the saddle Tyrion designed years ago. Bran is on that good weed, talking about how he likes to go back in time and watch people in history make big, baller moves.  
>  
>Tyrion sighs. “If I had that power I’d spend all my time watching old people fuck. Well... not old people. You know what I mean.”  
>  
>“That is why you do not have such power.”  
>  
>“Glad to see the Three Eyed Raven has a sense of humor.”

>“Oh, so you can’t read minds. I wasn’t sure.”  
>  
>“I only see into the past. Not the present or future.”  
>  
>“But you can change the past. Can’t you, Brandon?”  
>  
>... Bran gets real quiet.  
>  
>“Out of all the Starks I’ve reconnected with here at Winterfell, I’ve found you the most fascinating to observe. The way you just sit there, staring off into the distance. At first I assumed you were waiting for my brother at the gates, but even after you saw him, you just kept sitting there. Then I realized, you’re not really here, are you?”  
>  
>“It’s not a matter of where I am. It’s when I am.”  
>  
>“You went back in time and ordered the North to build the wall, didn’t you? The stories they tell about Brandon the Builder. That was you.”  
>  
>Bran’s dead ass quiet.  
>  
>“How?”  
>  
>“Deep down I knew it was me from the first time Old Nan read me that story.”  
>  
>“You wrote yourself into history.” Tyrion gets right in Bran’s face now. “Show me. I want to see what you see. Now. While there’s still time.”  
>  
>“Why?”  
>  
>“Because with my mind and your eyes we might just be able to survive the night.”  
>  
>Bran offers his hand. “What do you wish to see?”  
>  
>“Every time a dragon helped a Targaeryan win a war in Westeros.”  
>  
>Tyrion holds onto Bran. Their eyes roll back.

# Episode 3:

>Tyrion and Bran stand together, watching the Burning of Harrenhal and the Field of Fire from the Isle of Faces across the Lake, the God’s Eye. 3 dragons, Balerion, Vhagar, and Meraxes soar over the city, burning it to the ground. The castle walls explode.  
>  
>Tyrion is astounded. “I read about this battle in books as a boy.”  
>  
>Tyrion and Bran talk about the destructive power of dragons... and Targaeryans.  
>  
>“They say every time a Targaeryan is born, the Gods flip a coin,” says Bran.  
>  
>Tyrion catches the hint that Bran is suspicious of Daenerys. He turns around.  
>  
>“I’m assuming you watched my Queen’s rise to power.”  
>  
>“I watched her order her brother’s death, burn her enemies, and crucify slave owners.”  
>  
>“Have you watched what my sister has done?”  
>  
>That shuts Bran the fuck up.  
>  
>“If we survive the night it will be because of Daenerys and her dragons. She’s using her power to save your family. Considering everything the other houses of Westeros have stolen from the Starks, I would expect more gratitude from you. I believe she can be the ruler King’s Landing deserves.”  
>  
>“You’ve been wrong before.”  
>  
>That shuts Tyrion the fuck up.  
>  
>“I have watched all the Targaeryans rule. Daenerys is no more a just ruler than her father was.”  
>  
>“She’s not mad.”  
>  
>Tyrion blinks and suddenly he’s inside the Red Keep. He and Bran stand beside the Iron Throne where Aerys II, the Mad King, sits.  
>  
>It’s an expansion of the scene of Bran’s vision from Season 6 Episode 6. Tyrion watches his brother, Jaimie climb the steps to the iron throne, carrying his sword.  
>  
>Tyrion soaks in the cruelty of Aerys II’s presence.  
>  
>“BURN THEM ALL!” the Mad King shouts repeatedly. Slow at first, then so fast the 3 words blend into one. “Burnemall! Burnemall! Burnall!” Jaime slays Aerys. The King falls dead silent at the feet of his guard.  
>  
>“Tyrion, we have to go now,” says Bran.  
>  
>“Why? What’s happening?”  
>  
>“They are coming,” says Bran.  
>  
>“Who? The dead? But we haven’t found an answer yet on how to defeat them. We need more time to watch more battles.”  
>  
>“Nothing from the past can prepare us for what’s coming. The Night King has never ridden a dragon before.”  
>  
>“What can we do to stop him?”  
>  
>“Use our dragons against his.”  
>  
>Tyrion gasps as he returns to Winterfell. Suddenly, he’s back in the Godswood, holding onto Bran. He turns to see Theon and the Iron Born enter the sacred grove.  
>  
>Bran tells Tyrion to go to the crypts with Sansa. When they survive the night, he will show him more.  
>  
>After Tyrion descends into the crypts, Episode 3 starts as is. Everything up to the Dothraki charge stands. (It’s dumb, but it stands because it was still an amazing visual).  
>  
>But Bran isn’t useless in episode 3 anymore. When he tells Theon, “I have to go now,” he wargs into Jon’s dragon, Rhaegal, to help him kill wights as Theon and the Iron Born draw their arrows to protect him.  
>  
>Daenerys still takes off on her dragon after the Dothraki charge is wiped out. She rushes into the fight aback Drogon and starts torching fields of wights.  
>  
>As Rhaegal, Bran burns the fields of the dead. Jon rides on the dragon’s back as the White Walkers command a wall of fog to roll in and block the dragon’s view of the battlefield. Jon anxiously awaits the Night King’s arrival.  
>  
>Melisandre still lights the fire in the trenches just in time, EXCEPT the dead don’t just fall on the fire afterward to create a body bridge. By the rules of the show, the dead light up like torches whenever they touch fire. The fire trenches get put out when the White Walkers arrive at the front lines. (Oh yeah. We USE the white walkers in fact, we’re drawing our attention to a new 2nd in command General with some distinguishing facial feature who serves the Night King. Then the dead swarm the walls of Winterfell.  
>  
>Edd still dies saving Sam when the dead pour over the castle walls. Sam realizes he is WAY in over his head and runs for the crypts. He can’t make it that far before he’s forced into the Winterfell library. He takes shelter under a table and cries. (What a fuck).  
>  
>Brienne and Podrick both die. (Sorry. Not sorry.)  
>  
>Podrick is first to go. Brienne can’t save him and gets herself cornered attempting to rescue her squire. She tries to get back to Jaime, but the wooden ladder between them breaks and she can’t climb to higher ground. Jaime reaches down with his golden hand to save her. Brienne reaches up for Jaime as the dead drag her down. A White Walker sticks her in the back. The wights stab her legs. It’s clear that if she keeps holding on to Jaime they will both die. With the last of her strength, Brienne lifts herself up to steal a kiss from Jaime. She unbuckles his gold hand and falls into a pit of dead. (She dies a virgin... but still... she dies a knight.)  
>  
>Everything with Tormund stands. (If we can buy anyone standing on a pile of bodies, killing wights, it’s Milkdrinker).  
>  
>Everything with Greyworm and the Unsullied army also stands.  
>  
>Inside the castle, the Hound still suffers PTSD during the battle. He’s looking at the dead and at the fire, back to the dead and back to the fire... He’s about to give up.  
>  
>Beric shouts for Clegane’s attention, waking him from his reverie. Clegane is frozen by the fire. He tells Beric to fuck off and turns to flee. He runs into Melisandre. The red woman touches his face lovingly and says, “You who were kissed by fire at such a young age. The Lord of Light has chosen you.” Melisandre kisses the Hound.  
>  
>He pushes the Red Lady away and raises his sword, realizing it’s now ON FIRE.  
>  
>The Hound nearly drops his sword, but he doesn’t. Sandor Fucking Clegane holds it firmly, staring into the flames.  
>  
>“He chose you long ago, Sandor.”  
>  
>Beric calls out for the Hound. The Hound turns to see Beric pointing to Arya and Gendry, surrounded by a swarm of dead in the courtyard.  
>  
>The dead Giant still busts through the front gates and kills / is killed by a screaming Lady Mormont. (We all liked that part. Did you know that little actress can breakdance???).  
>  
>Anyways, Arya fights like a savage. Gendry gets impaled by a White Walker at the height of the battle. (All Men Must Die). Then Arya goes wild and starts killing ALL the White Walkers with the weapon Gendry designed for her. She’s about to be overrun in a massive gang up when fucking Sandor Clegane and Beric charge in swinging flaming swords. The Hound and Arya fight back to back against the dead in the courtyard, but the moment of triumph doesn’t last long. The dead are EVERYWHERE. Beric still gets stabbed like 8 times before he goes down.  
>  
>Nymeria’s pack of direwolves charge through the gates, smashed open by that dead giant. The wolves tear through the dead around Arya, The Hound, & Ser Berrick. Ghost joins in the fun. (Because we definitely didn’t just forget about him in that first Dothraki charge for budgeting reasons).  
>  
>The Hound manages to escape inside the castle, dragging Beric’s bloody body with him. Arya retreats after them. She calls out Nymeria’s name, but the direwolf doesn’t have time for a goddamn family reunion.  
>  
>Arya, The Hound, & a nearly-dead Ser Beric find themselves in the same chamber as Melisandre. Ser Beric dies (again), but Melisandre reveals that the Hound can now share the Last Kiss of the Lord of Light to resurrect Ser Beric like he once watched Thoros do. The Hound begrudgingly uses his magic to resurrect Ser Beric (again).  
>  
>Melisandre tells them both that the Lord of Light is not finished with them. (CLEGANEBOWL AIR HORNS SOUND). She turns her eyes to Arya and says, “He isn’t finished with any of you.” Melisandre still shares the same prophecy with Arya about her taking brown eyes, green eyes, & blue eyes.  
>  
>“What do we say to the God of death?”  
>  
>“Not Today.” Arya runs off to the Godswood to protect her brother Bran.  
>  
>Bran (still controlling Jon’s dragon via warg) is burning the army of the dead. As he does, he can see more dead giants and crazy dead bears and shit coming. Winterfell cannot be saved. Bran knows they are fucked.  
>  
>He wargs out of the dragon and comes back to the Godswood to see exactly how fucked Theon currently is. He calls out to him.  
>  
>“I know all that you’ve lost, Theon. But you’re a good man. Deep down. You always have been. I always considered you my older brother. You’re a Stark.”  
>  
>Theon: I fucking love you, Bran.  
>  
>Theon dies like Boromir defending Bran. He fights like he’s got nothing to lose. Except his limbs. He fights valiantly, but there’s like 10 White Walkers, not to mention General Icicle Beard. Theon is shredded.  
>  
>The White Walkers step on/over Theon toward Bran. All seems hopeless until Arya still leaps out of thin air and sticks the White Walker General with the pointy end. She still pulls that nifty drop stab move. The White Walker General shatters and with him a generous portion of the dead, but NOT ALL.

>What remains of the direwolf pack rushes into the Godswood to defend Arya and Bran.  
>  
>Daenerys is still knocked off her dragon, dodging ice spears chucked by White Walkers. (Thank goodness Gendry made dragon armor!) When she falls to the ground, surrounded by the dead, she’s still defended by Jorah until his dying breath.

>Jon’s dragon burns the White Walkers, catching fire to the weirwood tree. (Fuck Jon).  
>  
>Nymeria gets swarmed by the dead and so does Ghost. (I’m crying writing this).  
>  
>Arya knows it’s time to go. She lifts Bran out of his wheelchair, but she can’t quite drag him up onto the dragon with her.  
>  
>The direwolves are dead. The dead are still coming. Jon and Arya can’t get Bran on the dragon.  
>  
>Suddenly, Jaime Lannister is there to help push Bran onto the dragon’s back. The act costs Jaime his life. He gets gutted by White Walkers and Wights.  
>  
>The dragon takes off. Arya cries as she watches her childhood go up in flames. Jon admits “Winterfell has fallen.”  
>  
>Bran can’t bear to watch the weirwood tree burn. His eyes roll back in his head as he starts convulsing. He cries out to Jon. “Burn them all! Burn them all! Burn them all!”  
>  
>In his distress, he’s jumping throughout history.  
>  
>We see flashes of dragons. Red flames. Bran watches the Mountain burn the Hound’s face in the fire as a child. Green flames. Bran’s standing on Stanis’ ships as they are swallowed by dragonfire. He’s shouting inside the temple of the Sept of Bailor as It’s swallowed in green dragonfire. He watches Shireen, Stanis’ daughter, burn alive, and suddenly he’s the one burning at the stake. We see flashes of the Mad King sitting on the throne, shouting “Burn them all! Burn them all! Burnemall! Burnall! Burnall! Burnall!” Now Bran is sitting in the throne. Jaimie Lannister draws his sword. The Valyrian steel ignites on fire. The sword is plunged through the chest of the Mad King / Bran... and Bran’s body goes limp in Arya’s arms on the dragon.  
>  
>Arya screams for Jon’s attention. Jon makes an emergency landing south of the castle. He and Arya help pull Bran off the dragon. Bran now appears to be in a coma.  
>  
>Daenerys and Drogon torch the castle and the army of the dead inside and around it. At this point, it’s fish in a barrel.  
>  
>Tormund and Greyworm take cover inside the castle chambers as the walls blow up around them.  
>  
>The Starks lose Winterfell, but all the White Walkers get burned and the army of the dead is incinerated... WAIT... but where the hell are the Night King and Viserion?  
>  
>Meanwhile, in King’s Landing, Cersei is still trying to dodge Euron’s dick like a bullet, but he’s threatening to take away his fleet if she doesn’t give him some kind of twisted satisfaction.  
>  
>Cersei tells Euron she has a gift for him and to go to her room and wait. She checks in on Ellaria Sand, the former lover of Oberyn Martell who she left alive in prison to watch her daughter’s body rot.  
>  
>Cersei frees Ellaria and gives her to Euron. Ellaria has seen much better days but Euron’s into how freaky Cersei is. The Queen watches Euron tear into poor Ellaria with a sadistic smile. (Remember, she DID kill her daughter).  
>  
>A knock at the door interrupts the sadistic sexfest. Euron yells for whoever’s knocking to fuck off. It’s Qyburn. The hand needs to speak with the Queen.  
>  
>Cersei opens the door a little. “What is it?”  
>  
>Qyburn has real fear in his eyes.  
>  
>“Your grace. There’s a dragon flying toward the Red Keep.”

>Cersei’s face tightens. “The Dragon Queen?”  
>  
>Qyburn shakes his head.  
>  
>BOOM. The roof of Cersei’s palace apartment crumbles to reveal the Night King, flying on the back of Viserion, breathing blue fire on King’s Landing and the Red Keep.

# Episode 4:

>Ash falls like Winter Snow over King’s Landing. The Lannister Army roasts under blue flames. It’s a war zone on the ground. The civilian casualties are MASSIVE. (Dragons of Mass Destruction).  
>  
>The Scorpion’s decorating the walls of King’s Landing fire bolts that manage to pierce the dragon’s chest and head, but what is dead can never die (RIP Theon).  
>  
>The Night King lands his dragon and kills Lannister soldiers, then resurrects them to fight on his side.  
>  
>Viserion crashes through the roof of the Red Keep at the steps below lands the Iron Throne. (Roaring like the T-Rex at the end of Jurassic Park).  
>  
>The Knight King kills every guard who challenges him on his way up the steps to take a seat as King of Westeros. (Oooo....SHIT)  
>  
>In the midst of the chaos of the Night King’s attack, Ellaria tackles Cersei and tries to strangle her. Qyburn dispatches the Mountain to cut off Ellaria’s head. (It’s a mercy kill really).  
>  
>Qyburn organizes a secret escape for Cersei and Euron by boat with the Mountain’s protection. Euron promises to safely ferry Cersei to his fleet and sail her back to the Iron Islands. She has no choice but to follow him and flee the city. When Euron’s back is turned, Qyburn slips a vile of poison into Cersei’s hands and whispers “Should things turn out for the worst, my Queen. Your passing will be painless.”  
>  
>Parts of the Red Keep crumble as Cersei escapes. She can’t believe what’s happening. The Mountain takes the brunt of a few falling rocks that nearly crush Cersei and Euron. Qyburn isn’t so lucky. A piece of the ceiling falls and smashes his head in like a melon. Cersei screams.  
>  
>Euron pushes off into the sea in a row boat with Cersei and the Mountain. From a safe distance, they watch the Night King resurrect the dead Lannister armies and Golden Company to fight for him. Everything that Jon Snow and Daenerys warned Cersei about—the threat she considered too distant or unrealistic to worry about—ends up taking away everything she had (even her goddamn elephants! YES. That’s right. I said there are now zombie elephants in the story).  
>  
>Sansa and the northern forces emerge from the crypts in the dawn to discover Winterfell in ashes. Everything is dead. The white snow is torched black.  
>  
>Gilly, carrying baby Sam, finds Sam dead in the library. (No amount of plot armor can save you fat boy).  
>  
>Jon finds Sam’s body and realizes he died on top of a book. Gilly (who can read the book because Sam taught her how) gives it to Jon and Ser Davos. The pages are soaked in blood and describe, Lightbringer, a flaming sword prophesied to kill the Night King in the hands of Azor Ahai, the Prince who was promised. Ser Davos is all too familiar with the prophecy considering his history with Stanis and the Red Woman. He fills Jon in on the details and Jon says he read about Azor Ahai’s prophecy in a book passed down to him by Maester Aemon. Jon understands the last message his friend was trying to pass on to him. Sam believed Jon was the Prince that was Promised and that Longclaw, Jon’s sword, will become Lightbringer.  
>  
>Tyrion walks outside to discover Jaime dead in the Godswood. He finds his body charred from the waist down, but the top half is still forehead kissable. (Good night, Sweet Prince). Arya tells Tyrion that Jaimie died saving Bran. Tyrion cries.  
>  
>Tyrion tells the Stark sisters. “I only had one brother. He was the only one in my family who didn’t treat me like a monster.”  
>  
>Arya and Sansa look at each other and hug.  
>  
>Tyrion notices Bran is still in a coma type state after the weirwood tree burned. Arya waits until Tyrion finishes mourning Jaimie and then approaches his body. (We don’t see it, but you just KNOW she takes his face).  
>  
>Jon mourns Ghost, Sam, & Edd. He cries and tells Tormund, “Every brother I ever had in the Night’s Watch is dead.” Tormund holds Jon. He tells him. “We are brothers now.”  
>  
>Arya mourns Nymeria and Gendry. It’s rare to see her cry, but she sheds tears for Gendry.  
>  
>Sansa mourns Theon. Tormund looses his goddamn mind over Breanne. He cradles the big woman in his arms and ugly cries for an hour.  
>  
>Daenerys mourns Jorah.  
>  
>The Hound and Ser Beric use their fire swords to light pyres for the bodies that weren’t burned by dragon fire.  
>  
>Melisandre tells Beric that this will be his last life. She tells the Hound that the Lord of Light requires more service from him. When the time comes, he must use his gift again.  
>  
>“What about you, my lady?” asks Beric.  
>  
>Melisandre takes off her collar and walks naked into the winds of winter. Ser Davos still watches with a smile from the parapet as she collapses and dies.  
>  
>Daenerys, Tyrion, Varys, Greyworm, & Misandei assess the damage to their side. (The loss is about the same as in the show. 3/4 of the Dothraki are gone and about 1/2 the Unsullied).  
>  
>Daenerys wants what is left of the Northern forces to join her armies and march on King’s Landing to defeat Cersei’s army and secure the throne.  
>  
>Sansa is still like “bish, my men just fought the dead. They’re tired. Most are dead. We need to rally with the Knights of the Vale, Riverrun, Highgarden. The dead pose a threat to them all. We don’t have to fight this war alone, Daenerys. We can regroup and rearm.”  
>  
>“And the army of the dead will grow again,” says Jon.  
>  
>“And we’ll beat them again,” says Sansa.  
>  
>“Says the girl who spent the whole battle taking shelter in her family’s crypts.” (Daenerys goes full Real Housewives of Westeros)  
>  
>“We don’t all have dragons to fight for us.” Sansa looks at Jon.  
>  
>Daenerys is having a hard time staying patient with Sansa. Tyrion and Varys notice her temper brewing.  
>  
>Ser Davos interrupts the council after Bran awakens from his coma. Bran is wheeled in and tells everyone that the Night King has taken King’s Landing and raised a new dead army to defend it.  
>  
>Jon’s like “Fuuuck! See?!?”  
>  
>Bran also informs everyone that Cersei escaped the capitol with Euron and the Iron Fleet.  
>  
>But not ALL the Iron Fleet.  
>  
>Everybody looks at Bran like “WTF is this kid on?”  
>  
>Tyrion is the only one who figures out what Bran’s alluding to. “Yara Greyjoy.”  
>  
>“Yara has retaken the Iron Islands,” says Bran. (See? He’s actually a SUPER USEFUL FUCKING CHARACTER)  
>  
>“Send a raven,” Sansa orders. “If she can meet our people at the coast, she can ferry them to the Iron Islands where the dead will never reach them again.”  
>  
>“So that’s your war strategy? Run away?” Daenerys is not having it.  
>  
>“They are women and children.”  
>  
>“What about the Iron Throne?” asks Daenerys.  
>  
>Sansa stares daggers at Daenerys. “To hell with the Iron Throne.”  
>  
>Honor bound to his queen, Jon Snow wants to rush to march south with his Queen’s remaining army of Dothraki and Unsullied. He enlists the Northern armies and Tormund + the Wildlings to fight the dead (again) and save Westeros from Winter. (Typical fucking Jon Snow).  
>  
>Jon Snow still swears loyalty to Daenerys, despite Sam and Bran’s revelation that he is the rightful Targaeryan heir to the Iron Throne. He still says he doesn’t want it. Daenerys still asks Jon to hide his true identity to his family. Jon still promises Daenerys to keep the information between them secret, but still confesses it anyway to his family in the torched Godswood. (Ugh).  
>  
>Jon to Bran: “Tell them.”  
>  
>Bran: “Jon fucked his aunt.”  
>  
>Arya and Sansa still swear to keep it a secret and Sansa still plans to tell everyone. (Sansa is the new Littlefinger, y’all).  
>  
>After the reveal, Sansa and Arya meet in private. They both agree that Jon is being played (they’re also both grossed out by the Aunt thing).  
>  
>“It’s not really true what you said in the Godswood,” says Sansa. “The 4 of us aren’t the last of the Starks. Jon is a Targaeryan and Bran is... something else. It’s us Arya, you and me. We are the last of the Starks.”  
>  
>Arya nods. “I don’t trust the Dragon Queen. Just like I didn’t trust Littlefinger.”  
>  
>“I don’t trust Jon.” Sansa just HAD to say it. “I don’t trust him to take care of himself in King’s Landing. Men in our family don’t fair well in that city.”  
>  
>“I’ll watch over Jon,” says Arya. “And his aunt.”  
>  
>“I don’t trust anyone but you,” Sansa admits.  
>  
>Arya bows. “My Queen.”  
>  
>Tyrion is drinking again. Bronn busts in with the crossbow that Qyburn gave to him on Cersei’s behalf. The same crossbow Tyrion used to kill his father. He points the weapon at Tyrion.  
>  
>Tyrion still offers to pay Bronn more than Cersei to keep him alive. Bronn still obliges the idea. Tyrion still floats the prospect of making Bronn the Lord of Highgarden, but he wants something from Bronn in return.  
>  
>Tyrion and Bran share more adventures through time. Bran shows Tyrion how the Knight King was made by the Children of the Forest. Tyrion asks Bran why he doesn’t intervene and prevent this whole mess from ever happening.  
>  
>Bran tells Tyrion that’s not how it works.  
>  
>“Well then how in seven hells did you get them to build the wall?”  
>  
>Tyrion opens his eyes. It’s now winter. He stands alone in the snow. He looks around and discovers a huddle of the First Men gathered around a cave wall. Bran stands apart from the huddle. His eyes are rolled into the back of his head.  
>  
>He’s warging into one of the First Men, controlling his movements as he carves frantically into the stone, surrounded by a huddle of other First Men.  
>  
>“Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall!” The first man repeats the words under his breath as Bran speaks them aloud. Tyrion watches the mental connection of warging through time exhausts the First Man until he collapses into mumbles, shouting “Bildall! Bildall! Bildall” after drawing a huge rock carving of The Wall depicting a barrier between white Walkers and men to show his tribe members.  
>  
>“You can warg into men in the past,” notes Tyrion with disbelief.  
>  
>Bran’s eyes return to normal. “It comes with a cost.”  
>  
>Tyrion looks at the First Man thrashing on the floor like a fish out of water. “Bildall! Bildall! Bildall!”  
>  
>“I disable whoever I possess in the past. I drive them Mad,” says Bran.  
>  
>It takes Tyrion a second, but then he realizes what Bran is actually saying. He looks back at the First Man shouting “Bildall!” and says...  
>  
>“Burn them all. Burnemall. Burnall” He looks up at Bran in disbelief. “It was you.”  
>  
>Bran knows he fucked up. He won’t look Tyrion in the eyes.  
>  
>“So are the Targaeryans really mad? Or is it you?”  
>  
>“The moment appeared in my head when I asked Jon to burn Winterfell. I couldn’t help it.”  
>  
>“Considering all the power you have, you think you’d be of more help to the living. You still haven’t shown me how we can defeat the Night King.”  
>  
>At last, Bran breaks his silence. “There is a prophecy. Do you know the name Azor Ahai?”  
>  
>Tyrion nods. “The Prince who was Promised.”  
>  
>“It doesn’t have to be a prince,” says Bran. “The prophecy never implies gender. I remember looking up at the sky as a boy and seeing a red comet glow like a star in the sky. That was the night Daenerys was reborn from the fire with 3 dragons.”  
>  
>Tyrion gets mad chills. He knows EXACTLY where this is going now.  
>  
>Overcome by mounting impatience, Daenerys orders her forces (Greyworm, Missandei, & Varys) to sail for Dragonstone with her Unsullied armies to regroup and prepare for the siege of King’s Landing. She. wants. that. throne. bitch.  
>  
>Tyrion speaks with Daenerys after his vision quest with Bran. He explains to his Queen that it is in their interest to protect and shelter the Three Eyed Raven.  
>  
>Daenerys: uhh... Isn’t that weirdo a walking GPS for the Night King? (Oh poor choice of words Dany).  
>  
>“That’s why we must take care of him. The Three Eyed Raven is too precious to lose to the enemy. His gifts are incredible.”  
>  
>“The boy’s a cripple. How do you propose we keep him on the move, out of the enemy’s hands?”  
>  
>Tyrion smiles. You know this little mf is up to something.  
>  
>Bran Stark travels east in a horse carriage. Bronn holds the reigns, heading toward the coast.  
>  
>“Highgarden, you say?” says Daenerys.  
>  
>“A small price to pay for keeping the Three Eye Raven and myself alive.”  
>  
>“What does a Three Eyed Raven do?”  
>  
>“The Stark boy has shown me things. Things that can help me strategize on your behalf, to ensure you not only win the battle for King’s Landing, but the Great War.”  
>  
>“Tell me.”  
>  
>Tyrion asks If Daenerys has ever heard of the prophecy of Azor Ahai. She shakes her head.  
>  
>Tyrion recites the prophecy. “There will come a day after a long summer when the red stars bleed and the cold breathe of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire with a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.”  
>  
>Tyrion indicates that Daenerys COULD Be the Princess that was was Promised. “From smoke and salt you were born to make the world anew. You can triumph over darkness and bring about an unending summer if only you can forge Lightbringer and kill the Night King. If you make death bend the knee, you’ll bring peace to the Seven Kingdoms and be beloved by the people of Westeros. All those who die fighting for your cause shall be reborn.”  
>  
>Tyrion has Daenerys’ attention. “How does one become Azor Ahai?”  
>  
>“You need to forge a sword,” explains Tyrion.  
>  
>“I have two dragons,” says Daenerys. “I don’t need a sword.”  
>  
>Tyrion nods. “Yes, but the fulfillment of the prophecy requires something else you don’t have.”  
>  
>“And what is that?” asks Daenerys.  
>  
>“The Lord of Light’s blessing.”  
>  
>Before he leaves the North, Tyrion says goodbye to Sansa. She still tells Tyrion the secret of Jon’s lineage before he sails south to King’s Landing.  
>  
>Tyrion doesn’t swallow the news well. He starts drinking AS SOON as he finds out and lets it slip to Varys before the Spider sails south with the Unsullied to Dragonstone. Varys is sending out ravens all the way home.  
>  
>Meanwhile, Daenerys goes to Jon before the Northern armies ride south to Winterfell and asks for him to come with her. Jon asks where. Arya joins the conversation, observing Jon is getting suckered. Daenerys tells Jon and Arya that Tyrion has been vision-questing with Bran and now she knows a way to kill the Night King—a sword called Lightbringer. She knows how they can make it. Daenerys and Jon must travel to the God’s Eye together on their dragons. Jon is all about the mission. Arya is giving Jon the side eye. Jon dismisses Arya’s warning and tells Arya to ride south with the Northern armies, then meet him and Daenerys at the God’s Eye after they have Lightbringer.  
>  
>Jon leaves Tormund and Ser Davos in charge of overseeing the Northern army and Wildling’s march south to King’s Landing. The Targaeryans hop on their dragon’s and fly south towards the Riverlands.  
>  
>The Hound and Sansa share an intimate goodbye before the Hound leaves to ride south with Beric to King’s Landing. The Hound tells Sansa that she’s not the same little bird he once knew. He tells her that if she had left King’s Landing with him, then it would have all been different. She would have never been abused by Geoffrey, Littlefinger, or Ramsay. Sansa kisses Sandor Clegane on the cheek. She tells him “Do you know what the difference is between me and everyone else who wants the Iron Throne? I know how to move on. I let go of Geoffrey, I let go of Littlefinger, and I let go of Ramsay. What they did to me in the past does not define who I am today. I am not a victim. I’m a survivor.” (Sansa does NOT say that all the rape and abuse made her into the strong woman she is today. Frankly, that logic is revolting and shows how little the writer’s actually understand or value women).  
>  
>Sansa leaves with the women and children who survived the Battle of Winterfell to meet Yara’s boats on the west coast and see them off safely to the Iron Islands.  
>  
>Bran awaits Tyrion on a smuggling frigate. Bronn and a small crew prepare to disembark.  
>  
>“I’ve never left the North before,” says Bran.  
>  
>“It’s not so bad,” Arya answers, appearing suddenly among the crew members. “I sailed to Bravos once.”  
>  
>“I know. I’ve watched you grow up sister. I know I wasn’t there, but I’ve seen what you went through to become no one. The many face you’ve worn.”  
>  
>Arya’s insistent. “Vhalar Morgulus.”  
>  
>Bran looks at the horizon. “I won’t tell you where Cersei is.”  
>  
>“She killed our father, Bran.”  
>  
>“I know. I don’t want to lose you too.”  
>  
>“So you’d rather I ride south to fight the dead and die in a battle that was never mine to begin with? I don’t care about killing the Night King. That’s never been my fight. I want Cersei.”  
>  
>“And I hope you get her,” says Tyrion, arriving at the ship, clearly drunk. “For my sake and yours, and when you drive that needle through my dear old sissy’s heart, do tell her the Lannisters send their regards.”  
>  
>Arya stares at Tyrion. “You know her better than anyone.”  
>  
>“No. That would be Jaime.”  
>  
>“Jaime’s dead,” says Arya. Tyrion’s eyes gloss at the reminder. “Tell me where she’s going.”  
>  
>“To hell,” says Tyrion. He looks up at Bronn. “Are we ready to set sail?”  
>  
>“Tell me why I’m doing this again,” says Bronn.  
>  
>“When Daenerys is Queen. She will make you Lord of Highgarden.”  
>  
>“Right.” Bronn shrugs. “Where we sailing to?”  
>  
>“Nowhere sounds as good as anywhere” says Tyrion. He looks back at Arya, who looks severely put out. He shrugs.  
>  
>“If I was Cersei I would fall back to Dragonstone and snatch the island out from under Daenerys.” He toasts his glass to Arya. “Happy?”  
>  
>Arya steps off the boat onto the dock and climbs back on her horse.  
>  
>Meanwhile at sea, Varys is throwing out the spider signal to every major house in Westeros, revealing the truth of Jon Snow’s heritage. That’s when Euron’s Iron Fleet (who everyone assumed would have already dipped back to the Iron Islands) ambushes Danaery’s army at Dragonstone. Euron destroys the Dragon Queen’s ships. Cersei relishes it. (Switch Tyrion’s perspective with Varys.) Missandei is still captured by Euron and Cersei. Euron retreats to the Iron Islands. Everyone still washes up on Dragonstone BUT Euron never kills Rhaegal with that lucky shot from a mile away.  
>  
>Jon and Daenerys land their dragons on the Isle of Faces, inside the lake known as the God’s Eye. They leave their dragons and approach a grove of weirwood trees. (This forest is creep level 3000)  
>  
>The trees grow in a spiral pattern, similar to the Dragon sigil of the Targaeryan House and the spiral patterns that the dead took the time to nail to the wall with dead bodies in Castle Black.  
>  
>Jon sees tree and wall carvings of green men and green children.  
>  
>Jon asks Dany, “What is this place?”  
>  
>“Tyrion told me the Isle of Faces was where the pact between the Children of the Forest and the First Men was made. The War ended here. It is the most powerful vortex of magical energy in Westeros.”  
>  
>Jon examines all the faces carved and painted into the white weirwood trees long ago by the Children of the Forest.  
>  
>Daenerys confronts Jon about his betrayal. She knows he broke his promise, disobeyed his Queen, and told his family the truth about having Targaeryan blood, jeopardizing their entire future together. Sansa told Tyrion who told Daenerys.  
>  
>Jon draws his sword and offers it to Daenerys. “Let’s do what we came to do.” He swears he is still loyal to Daenerys. He swears he doesn’t want the throne. He only cares about defeating the dead.  
>  
>Jon bends the knee and holds up Longclaw. He stammers through an apology. Daenerys takes Jon’s sword, bows down and silences him with a long kiss, but Jon can’t hold the connection. (Too incesty). When he pulls away, Daenerys seizes the opportunity to pierce Jon through the heart with Longclaw, right through the chest. She chooses to be feared rather than loved in Westeros. She kills Jon because he’s a threat to her throne (NOT just because he rejects her sexually).  
>  
>Daenerys tells Jon that he was resurrected by the Lord of Light so that she could drive the sword through his living heart, just as Azor Ahai once did to his love, Nissa Nissa. A part of Jon’s soul merges with the sword to turn Longclaw into Lightbringer.  
>  
>The sword glows fiery red in Daenerys hands.  
>  
>“Your blood may be Targaeryan, but you are not a dragon.”  
>  
>Jon Snow falls at Daenerys feet and DIES (again). Daenerys leaves his body on the Isle of Faces and flies to Dragonstone with both her dragons.

108,brxxp4,[SPOILERS] Season 8 Ending,"After reflecting on the entirety of GOT for a few days my take is that Bran represents the all knowing all seeing artificial intelligence that may someday rule over our species.   Now many people, including GRRM have mentioned the link between the dead and climate change, or dragons and WMDs.  In addition, we can easily draw parallels with respect to competition for resources and power leading to conflicts that quickly grow out of control.  So the competitive nature of people leads them to survive and thrive early in there development, but becomes self-destructive to a catastrophic extent in the end.  Eventually, the destruction becomes so predictable and severe that people are willing to turn over control of society to an unbiased emotionless AI(Bran).  That entity can access our entire history instantly(servers/databases), see our entire present(cameras/drones/satellites) and use all that information to predict the future(POI).  Jon going north with the free folk would represent people who are unwilling to live under constant surveillance.  Arya exploring places off the map would represent pioneers attempting to settle Mars or other places outside of what we now know exists.",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/brxxp4/spoilers_season_8_ending/,2019-05-23 06:51:18

116,brgmuk,[Spoilers] How GOT Should Have Ended! Long but Worthy read (I promise),"Hello all,This is my first ever post on reddit, and most likely my last as well. I am not too familiar how this works, nor if this will catch on, but here it goes.

First I will discuss a few problems (out of hundreds) that I had with the season and how I would fix them:

* dealing with Night King before Cersei
* Night King not really a threat to humanity, only the north really- Northerners dealt the brunt of ""saving"" humanity
* no real reason why Night King attacked Winterfel at that time, why not just go around winterfel, get literally an army of millions of wargs while they stay in Winterfel and starve to death
* no real reason why Night King himself needed to kill Bran and not send any(thing) else
* powers such as Arya's faceless abilities and Bran's warging abilities pretty much useless
* dragons much too weak (Rhaegal)/dragons (Drogon) much too powerful- abrupt ending- no real easing into Dany's madness
* Jaime was just a disaster

Now, this is how I would have ended the series (if anyone really cares):

1. I would have dealt with Cersei before the night king, I mean that only makes sense to me considering how the war for the thrones was just a side conflict during the entire series. For this case it would have to be assumed that Jaime is still with Cersei in King's Landing and Cersei and the 'fake out' of Cersei from last season was discovered. Dany, reluctant to 'waste' her army for the fight against the Night King declines the call and chooses to fight Cersei instead. This can be the start to her madness, saying things like ""I don't care about the North"" or ""The throne is mine and that is all I care about"" etc.Dany decides to ignore her council and says she doesn't really need an army because she has two dragons and uses Aegon's destruction of Harrenhal as her main thought. She goes with Rhaegal and Drogon alone to destroy the Red Keep and there at the walls of the city she is met with scorpions, which the first bypasses. Once reaching the Red Keep, she is met with another line of Scorpions where this time they strike and kill Rhaegal and he falls to his death in Kings Landing. Dany reluctantly flies away with Drogon.Back on Dragonstone the first and better plan are hashed out. During the ""negotiations"" Tyrion tries to negotiate as per the show, however, the trigger for Dany won't be Messandei (who is safe) but rather a 'gift' presented to Dany on Cercei's command which is presented to her infront of the gate. It is carried by 6 King Landing men and once it is opened Dany sees Rhaegar's head. This is her main trigger. I mean Massandei dying is sad and all, but seeing the head of her 'child' would send anyone off the deep end. Dany orders the capture of the men who brought out the 'gift'. They demand ""Parlay"" and ""mercy"" saying they were ordered to do so and they are just messengers, however through Dany's madness they are all executed on the spot.The Battle for King's Landing would be swift. First scene would be Euron Greyjoy eating at the bottom of his ship and one of his crew asks him ""anything else m'lord?"" Euron is shocked (all his crew are mute) and pulls his sword and demands to know who the crewmate is. Scene ends with the crewmate smiling. Next scene is ""Euron/Arya = Eurya"" demanding all the ships turn around and head to Kings Landing Wall. There Eurya orders all his scorpions destroy the scorpions on the wall, leaving the much needed gap for Drogon and Dany to sneak within the wall and destroy all the scorpions from inside the King's Landing Wall. Same thing as the show happens with the destruction of the Golden Company, and the sacking of King's Landing etc.The Hound makes it to the Mountain and they have their Cleganebowl (just for fan service, not really part of the plot) this flight, for the love of Christ, will be more epic ... I mean how can the Hound/Brienne fight be more epic than the Cleganebowl!? I digress. All that is left are Cyburn \[sic.\] Jaime and Cersei. There she orders Cyburn to burn the city down, all of it, and tell the pyromancers. Jaime is once again left to choose and he chooses once again the noble act of killing Cyburn and then kills Cersei with tears in his eyes.The episode ends with Dany's forces entering the throne room as Jaime is weeping over his sister's body over his lap.
2. Now that Cersei is dealt with, everyone can focus on the real threat. The coronation is awesome and Dany is queen. All the Lords of Westeros are invited and they all swear allegiance to her. Jon now says it is time to go north. Dany (madness) denies him and says the only way she will help him is if he gives her the north and he steps down as king. She says the same line as Cersei by saying the Night King will weaken the north for her etc. Another hint of her madness can be that she names Grey Worn the commander of the King's Guard. He accepts but Messandei is not happy. Greyworm does not understand what he just accepted and Messandei tells him later. In another scene with the three of them Greyworm tells Dany of his lack of knowledge and asks if he could step down. Dany accepts, but at the price of his head for treason. She then demands that Greyworn no longer be with Messandei and orders her to be by her side (alienating her allies).
3. During this time the North is called to be de-polulated. Yes you heard me, ALL of the northerners are forced to flee south ... ALL OF THEM. I mean if there is a threat to humanity itself, the threat should be taken extremely seriously no? Now that the kingdoms are all united, it literally becomes a fight with ALL humanity in Westeros vs. the White Walkers (not just the Northerners and Vale Lords). The reach is ordered to feed the refugees, the Westerlands forced to pay for defences etc. the Stormlands are forced to mine all the dragonglass etc. The Dornish is forced to give all their soldiers etc. Basically it is literally every single army in Westeros is united. Let's give them a number of 100 000 soldiers. All the Lords meet at the Neck and that is where they will put their defence, an actual defence not what we saw in the show.
4. Strategy: As we have seen before, killing a White Walker results in the death of all 'his' wrights. That being said, the strategy is to assassinate as many White Walkers before they make it to the neck. This is where the Dothraki (offensive forces) come into play. This is also where we can kill off some of the major actors. Raiding parties of horsemen and Assassins are guided by Bran Stark (utilizing his Warging) all the way north, and you can have many different montages of cavalry charges, hit and run tactics, and assassinations of White Walkers thus reducing the undead army the 10s of thousands. Of course none of those who leave for these missions come back, but it is price they all accepted to pay. Bran can be seen warging into bears and wolves to help with the killing of some White Walkers. Yes, Bran is my favourite character.
5. The battle of the Neck begins and lets just say it will be epic, but the humans lose. All humanity is lost and literally everyone is retreating. After majority of the characters are dead, humanity is doomed. Bran then comes out of a warging session and tells the survivors he now understands the night king's plan. The Night King's mission is to raise the children of the forest (found on the Isle of Faces) in order to have them join his army and use their magic to cross into Essos. It would be poetic justice that they created him and now he would raise them from the dead to work for him. Bran says that the Night King himself has to do it, hence why he has to be physically on the ground. On the Isle of Faces the humans set up and ambush and \[pardon the lack of specifics\] the Night King is killed by JON SNOW.
6. After the death of the Night King, Jon becomes a hero. Dany continues her madness and demands the execution of many men for ""fleeing the Battle of the Neck"" (even though all retreated). This is met with disapproval from Jon and the remainder of the forces. Dany demands their disobedience or else ""they will share their fate"". That is when Bran reveals who Jon Snow really is to everyone and no one wants to go against the Tree God, so all the lords back Jon. A 'skirmish' happens between the Dothrakis, Unsullied and the Westerosis. Long story short, Dany is killed by Jon and that's when Drogon comes in and mourns her death and flies away (just as in the show).
7. Jon denies being the King and refuses his crown, saying that the honourable thing to do after 'queenslaying' and 'kinslaying' is to be executed. So he chooses the Black (just as in the show). The rest can go on as the show ended, with Bran being voted king because literally all the Lords and men saw his power. They fear him as a god.

I know this was a very long post, but here it is. Again this is my first, and probably my last post on Reddit, so let me know how I did. I know there are many characters I missed, but again I'm not really dealing with the micro-plots but rather with the macro-plot.

I was thinking of making a YouTube video on this, but I did not know where to start.

Edit: I wanted to make this a relatively short post, but I have a much much more detailed thoughts going in detail about the micro-plots, e.g. Dany forcing Yara to bend the knee once again, Theon's redemption, Jaime's execution, Dothraki tactics (similar to mongols), and overall killing of Dany's unsullieds and Dothrakis being the plan of Bran in order to make it easier for the Westerosi forces to ultimately win etc. etc. etc.",13,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/brgmuk/spoilers_how_got_should_have_ended_long_but/,2019-05-22 02:08:41

120,br9n6d,[SPOILERS] Jon Snow Discussion,I think most of us can agree that Jon Snow didn’t really join the Nights Watch. He joined the free folk. It kinda made it seem that way when it showed the wall closing and he looked back. So my question is. Do you think Jon Snow will live beyond the wall forever. Or do you think he could ever return to Winterfell and at least visit? I mean the unsullied are gone so they shouldn’t be a threat. And I’m sure Arya isn’t gonna stay gone forever maybe in the future she could return and I was wondering if you think Jon Snow would ever return to Winterfell,41,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/br9n6d/spoilers_jon_snow_discussion/,2019-05-21 16:12:08
121,brfaua,"[NO SPOILERS] If D&D wanted to move onto Starwars, why didn't HBO hire different writers to continue for new seasons?","I just don't understand this. GRRM has said that the actual song of ice and fire story could have went on for about 10-13 seasons, but since D&D received a very lucrative offer from disney to go write for star wars, they wanted to end the show with only 8 seasons (73 episodes). Why couldn't HBO just hire new, but just as good, writers? I mean they and GRRM would be the ones producing the show, so money wasn't a problem. And, GRRM could still provide general story outlines for how the show should continue. So it's not like the show would have no direction post- season 8.

I know that different writers can sometimes change the whole feeling of the show, but there has to have been a way around this, right? Or am I wrong?

I'm just really upset that this is the reason that the show rushed to ending.

123,brbo2m,[Spoilers] How Daenerys story arc potentially could have worked for me personally,"I loved the episode called ""The Broken Man"", where The Hound helps Septon Ray and villagers in building a new Sept. The villagers are approached by outlaws, former members of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Refusing to take the steps needed to protect himself and his people, the septon Ray preaches peace. Later, as The Hound is gathering wood for the fires, the outlaws return and massacre the villagers, and hang the sept. This enrages The Hound, and it is the major instigating scenario that will guide his character for the rest of the story. Personally, I feel like if we'd had even one episode like this, that focused on Dany, and left us believing in some way that she was capable of using a nuclear weapon on an entire city of innocents, this just might have convinced me. Yes, of course, we see many places throughout the plot where Dany has no problem being ruthless, but without fail it is almost always her being more ruthless than the people she is administering justice to. Never before in the story has she turned on innocent people, certainly not to this scale. So, if the show runners could have given me even part of an episode dedicated solely to Dany, and what could drive such a drastic action, maybe, just maybe it could have convinced me to go along for the ride...",17,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/brbo2m/spoilers_how_daenerys_story_arc_potentially_could/,2019-05-21 19:19:13

146,bqse35,[SPOILERS] Here's what I didn't like about the finale,"1. Daenerys' justification for mass slaughter is vague at best. She believes she freed a generation from tyranny by murdering them. She seems rather cogent, and I'm not going to believe that she is now downright delusional and crazy after barely two episodes of set up.

2. Why is Jon trying to defend Daenerys' actions against  Tyrion's condemnations? I get he's conflicted, but Jon doesn't seem like the type of guy who needs a motivational pep talk from Tyrion to help him see that what Daenerys did was morally insane.

3. The dragon had an intuition that the throne symbolized possessive political power, and that that was truly the thing that killed his mother. I understand the poetic meaning behind it but, like the horse at the end on E5, it just doesn't fit well.

4. Where is that white horse anyways? Arya is still around. Did she literally just use that horse for a two minute ride and then shooed it away once she left the city?

5. There was a weird time gap between Daenerys' death and Greyworm's consultation with the Westerosi lords. It was a bit jarring.

6. Selecting a king was mentioned off-hand in conversation and it literally takes ten minutes for everyone to unanimously come to a decisions based off of a one-minute inspirational talk from Tyrion.

7. Why are the lords bargaining with Greyworm in the first place? Why don't they just forcefully take Jon. They could easily overwhelm him. What power does Greyworm have over them?

8. Greyworm is evil. 

9. None of Jon's siblings mention that their brother is the true heir? Wouldn't this help rally support for Jon's freedom?

10. The Jon and Dany pregnancy side story was completely forgotten.

11. Jon's parentage didn't do much else than establish drama between him and Dany. His parents were just used as a mechanism for Dany to be pissed off at him. Beyond that, Jon's parents aren't significant narrative-wise.

12. Jon ends up reverting back to his season 1 self--damned to the Night's Watch.

13. Why is there a Night's Watch after the dead are gone and the Wildlings are no longer a threat?

14. Arya is a pirate.

15. Bran knew thousands of innocents would die but I guess he couldn't do anything because fate or something.

16. How does Bran being ""the memory of everything"" make him a qualified candidate for being king? Okay, sure, he doesn't ""want"" the throne which makes him less power hungry--but is that a strong enough determinant for being a good king? 

17. It felt way too rushed.

18. All of this happening three episodes after the Night King is killed just feels off. The Night King was treated as some side plot that needed to be disposed of.

19. Bronn serves on the small council.

20. Arya never used her face power at all this season.

21. Jon and Tyrion didn't do much this season.

22. This was the final episode of a fantastic show. It felt rushed, shallow, and inconclusive.",31,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bqse35/spoilers_heres_what_i_didnt_like_about_the_finale/,2019-05-20 11:24:03

149,br5bdb,[SPOILERS] My half-assed fan theory: A cyclical timeline where Jon Snow becomes the next Night King,"I like to think the show was left for a cyclical timeline where Jon Snow becomes the next Night's King.  Yea, I know this has been beaten to death already, but the show does leave the door open, so it's a fun idea to play with.  Hear me out:

The Night's King was originally created by the Children of the Forest to stop the destruction of The First Men.  However, the Children of the Forest did not intend to destroy man, but simply create a balance that would stop the obliteration of their people and other creatures of pre-Westeros.  At the end of the show, Jon is conveniently sent back north to lead the Night's Watch.  It is possible that some Children of the Forest still remain, and with the Night King destroyed, and the armies of men reunited under Bran, the Children of the Forest may be inclined yet again to restore balance by creating a new Night's King.  Bran, having close ties to the Children of the Forest as the Three-Eyed Raven, and with the ability to see past and future, may also be working to maintain the balance.  It makes sense for this reason that Bran, an ally of the CotF, would send Jon back to the Night's Watch, despite knowing there is no longer an impending danger beyond the wall.  We see at the end of the final episode Jon wandering out beyond the wall.  Perhaps Jon, like the Night King, will encounter the CotF, and be turned into the next Night King.

The creation of the Night King from the show: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9EWKRDAFXM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9EWKRDAFXM)

Jon's story is also similar to that of the Night's King before he was turned.  Consider Old Nan's story of how the Night King came to be:

\> He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night's Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. ""And that was the fault in him,"" she would add, ""for all men must know fear."" A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.

\> He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.

[https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s\_King](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night%27s_King)

The story closely parallels Jon's own story, also with a queen who's skin as white as the moon.  But perhaps Old Nan's story was not meant to be taken literally, and understandably so given the lack of records of the Night's King.

One last thought, there are many references to seasonal change (winter is coming!) in Game of Thrones, which in of itself may imply a cyclical (seasonal) timeline to the show.

Although I'm sure my hypothesis is wrong, I would love to see a ""sprequel"" to the series, both continuing the story where it left off, and simultaneously exploring the origins of the Night King.

What are your thoughts?  How badly would this ruin the show for you?  Is there any way you could see this working out?

153,bqylec,[SPOILERS] I signed the rewrite petition. Here’s why and how I thought the season could be better. #1,"So I'm one of the many people (1 million, the last time I checked the rewrite petition) who hasn't been the biggest fan of this season. So, I just wanted to discuss some of the things I didn’t like in the episodes. 

I don’t just want to complain though, that’s not really productive; so at the end of this I also want to say how I think it should’ve ended given what went wrong.

Now, I don't want people to take this as me trashing the writers, because that's not what this is. I've loved everything they've done with the show thus far, and yes, they’ve had source material to work with; but it wouldn't be fair or accurate to say they haven't added anything of value to the story. 

As I understand it, they've made some pretty big changes to the original books’ story, but that's also why this season has been so disheartening. 

The quality of this show gave me very high expectations, and I was more than a little disappointed that they dropped the ball (at least in my opinion). I also broke it up into parts because, frankly, it was a little too much to put in one post. Now that that's out of the way I'll just jump right into it.
 
Episodes 1 and 2

I actually don't really have anything bad to say about these two. They did a great job laying out the new landscape with Daenerys in Westeros, the wall being destroyed, and Cersei dealing with the reality that white walkers are real while also pursuing her own interests.

Episode 3

This is where things started to go downhill. Now, the Battle of Winterfell was AMAZING to watch. The choreography and visual effects in this fight were perfect. Plot wise, though, it fell short for a few reasons. The most damaging to me was that it was predictable. Not predictable in the sense that I could give you a play-by-play, but structurally it was predictable. 

It was the same tired underdog hero vs. villain trope we’ve all seen a million times before. For any other show this wouldn’t be the end of the world, but it goes against everything that made GoT amazing in the first place. 

Season one was brilliant because it set up this trope perfectly, so perfectly, in fact, that we all thought everything would work out for Ned right up until his head was on the floor.  George R.R. Martin and every other writer involved knew that this plot structure was growing stale, and to paraphrase The Dark Knight’s Joker, when things start getting stale you introduce a little chaos and everyone starts losing their minds, and we sure did. 

We lost them so much that we all became obsessed, and turned GoT into the most popular show on the planet. Every season since has been the writers keeping us guessing about who’s the protagonist and who’s the antagonist only to crush all our expectations and tell us it doesn’t matter. In the end, everyone dies. 

So, with this in mind, why, in the largest fight yet, would you chose to fall on this trope? This fight could’ve ended in so many different ways, but you chose to use the one plot structure that’s the antithesis of GoT? Even if you were to use this ending, this wasn’t the way to do it. It just physically didn’t make sense to me, which brings me to my next problem. 

How did Arya manage to get through a complete circle of wights where the only opening was through a crowd of white walkers, which are EVEN STRONGER than the wights? 

Yeah, I saw the sneaking scene too, but she literally would’ve had to brush up on their shoulders saying “excuse me,” to get past them. Not only that, but she would’ve had to sprint, since she managed to make that epic jump at the Night King, and she did all of this, mind you, through deep noisy snow. 

“Come on Sand, that’s sexist! If Jon had made that jump you would’ve been ok with it!” No, I wouldn’t. 

The issue isn’t with her being a woman, or even if she’s able to jump like that. I actually think, with her training, that Arya could make that jump in a regular fight. The real problem with the ending isn’t if she’s physically capable of it, it’s could she do it under the circumstances. Circumstances being a mosh pit of wights and white walkers standing in deep snow.

“But Sand clearly the wights were immobilized because the Night King showed up!” Ok, I can live with that, but even if the wights were immobilized the white walkers sure as hell weren’t. 

How do I know that? Because just before Arya’s big moment there is a scene when a white walker notices something moving past him and turns to look at it (Don’t believe me? Check out 1:17:19 in episode 3). Noticing something requires awareness, and awareness means they weren’t mindless drones at the time. 

That means that Arya was close enough to be noticed, yet remained largely undetected. 

Undetected, while sprinting and shoving her way through a crowd of wights in noisy snow? When just hearing a drop of blood on the floor was enough to draw a wight’s attention before? Yeah, that seems weird. Now, I know audiences should be willing to stretch their imaginations a little, but this was taking it too far for me.

The last major blunder I saw was that it really betrayed the show thematically. This is just my interpretation of GoT, but I think it’s been a pretty blatant message, which goes something like this: 

People like to forget about death. We shove any mention of it as far away as possible, (i.e. why the center of Westeros’ culture is all the way in the south and the white walkers are all the way in the north) and we put up all kinds of constructs to help us forget about it. Some are physical (*cough* like giant walls *cough*) but the most prolific ones are social. We set up all different kinds of hierarchies based on wealth, gender, race, religion, etc. so some people can feel superior to others, but none of them really matter. They’re just games. Just like kids play games and forget about reality, we’ve been playing these social games and forgot the one thing, the only thing, that matters. That no one is better than anyone else because death comes for us all.

If you consider Jon’s path thus far, he’s essentially been confronted with this truth and has spent the rest of the show trying to convince everyone to wake up from the game and face reality. To realize that death is the real enemy. 

Now, I think it’s pretty obvious that the white walkers represent death since they’re a hive mind army of zombies (aka an army of death), who’s merciless and can’t be negotiated with (like death), and whose sole purpose is to wipe out all life (like death), but I’ll explain it just to be thorough. 

It also seems pretty clear by the title of the book series, A Song of ICE and FIRE, that the main conflict revolves around two opposing forces. We have our ice but who’s our fire? Maybe its the-mother-of-fire-breathing-lizards-who-also-happens-to-regularly-walk-through-fires-on-the-side? Yeah, Daenerys sounds like a good fit to me too. 

So now we have our two main forces: Fire and Ice, aka Energy and Stagnation, aka Life and Death. But wait a minute, the Night King’s already dead. So what’s the story now? Life vs. Petty Life? 

Yeah… that doesn’t sound right to me either.

161,bqrtwp,[Spoilers] Here’s to the manipulators and the saps!,"Bran Stark can manipulate the past and see somewhat into the future.  When he manipulated events to save humanity from the Night King, that was great. When he did it to become the actual King, not so much. There was only one way Bran Stark would ever become king, and we just saw it. It required Daenerys and Jon to help defeat the Night King, then for Daenerys to defeat Cersei, and then for them to both eliminate each other. Bran is the one who first spread the secret that Jon was Aegon Targaryen, which he had to know was going to cause this result.  The show implies Bran knew he was going to be crowned King, and Bran told Jon he was always “right where he was supposed to be” — this could be interpreted to mean that Bran has manipulated the past and sees the future more than he lets on.  I believe he manipulated his way to the throne, and if so that means he is probably evil, because he knew that King’s Lansing would be decimated if he shared Jon’s secret with him. 

Sansa learned from Little Finger and manipulated her way right into her own throne using his level of dirty trickery. 

Tyrion managed to manipulate his way out of a death sentence yet again. This time he manipulated Jon to be his champion and kill Dany for him.  

Funny how Jon was supposed to be their preferred King, but instead they use him to kill Dany and then cast him aside.  Jon is the sap — trusting Sansa and listening to Tyrion and losing everything because of it.",4,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bqrtwp/spoilers_heres_to_the_manipulators_and_the_saps/,2019-05-20 10:17:04

173,bqtu61,[S8E8] Season 8 finale: scenes you genuinely liked/enjoyed,"To be honest, I haven't yet decided on whether I'm disappointed or not with the finale but a couple of scenes stood out for me. They might not be popular and it might be that I'm fangirling but here they are:

* Daenerys' dying scene: While it felt a bit underwhelming when it happened, Drogon trying to move Dany and his rage made me genuinely cry. It pretty much felt like a child experiencing first hand the loss of their parent and him gently picking her up with his claws after after his rage burnt the throne brought such a contrast of emotions. Dragons are so sentient and intelligent and that was evident when Drogon burnt the Iron Throne, the real cause of death of his mother. 
* Dany watching the Iron Throne and experiencing all the feels, until finally preparing to sit also fit to her vision she had years ago. As close as she got, she never got the chance to sit on it, just like she didn't in her vision. Instead she's not probably with her son and Khal Drogo.
* Sansa looking like a bride, walking to the throne and being announced as the Queen of the North. Powerful scene, pretty much what she always wanted and she got there by great personal losses. I feel like the way she looked when being crowned, in white, reminiscent of her marriage scene to Ramsey probably means she'll never marry noone but the throne and I want to think she'll be a great queen.

I'm not ready to say goodbye to GoT yet despite the end, but these scenes helped me at least get a feel worthy of the ending of such a show. And I know, that's personal opinions and probably not even popular but I'm choosing to focus on the good things instead of the bad in the finale.

179,bqckfa,[Spoilers] Battle of The Trident,"In several places throughout the series we hear referenced, ""the Battle of The Trident"".. What is this, and why is it important, you might ask. 

The Trident is a river, several hundred miles north of King's Landing. It is here that the gauntlet was laid down and the rebels led by Robert Baratheon met the loyalists led by the Mad King's son Rhaegar Targaryen. It was a legendary battle that would help shape the political structure that is in place at the beginning of the television series. Many of the characters we hear of and meet during the series began their rise or died, during this battle.

It was the the endgame to the rebellion that began when Jon Snow's father, Rhaegar Targaryen eloped with Lyanna Stark and married her. Robert Baratheon, enraged, because he'd been promised Lyanna, went on a murderous warpath, fueled by his hatred of Targaryens, and enabled by the general discontent of the nobles tired of Targaryens rule.

At ""The Trident"" Robert Baratheon did defeat Rhaegar Targaryen in single combat at what would later be called the Ruby Ford, so named because when Robert's warhammer came crashing down upon Rhaegar's chest and mortally wounded him, it burst his plate armor asunder scattering precious rubies across the banks of the river. It was on this day that the fate of the Targaryen dynasty was sealed. Many atrocities remained to be carried out, murderous rampages, royal bloodletting, but it was here that the major question of where Westeros would head politically was answered.

208,bpobeh,[NO SPOILERS] Food for thought. Would cast return if HBO did do a spinoff or remake?,"After the petition today, I still believe it is extremely unlikely. Regardless, I do think it is interesting to consider whether or not cast members would return. I do believe several cast members would sign in a heartbeat. The cast members who really love the show and love being a part of it. I'm certain there are cast members who do not feel this way. Its been almost 10 years. There has to be some that want to move on. I feel like Nikolaj (Jamie) has voiced his frustration as much as he could at the time. There will likely be others who join him in their feelings on the ending of the show. Would the show feel the same if he isn't playing Jamie Lannister? Or let's say, Kit Harington not playing Jon? God forbid Lena Headey not playing Cersi. At least for me, I could manage a recast of minor characters. They have gone through several Gregor Cleganes, and completely blindsided me when they recast Daario Naharis (although for the better). But, I was able to live with those. I want a remake as much as the next guy. But, I just don't know if I could get over some recasts that would be bound to happen. Don't think Sophie Turner or Peter Dinklage would return for a remake. For various reasons. Are there any cast members that straight up would say yes in a heartbeat? Or any that would be certain No's?

Were we tricked the entire time to complete the entire circle?    Daenerys was originally an object to help earn and army before she rose to power.  Along the way we cheered and rooted for her as she ""convinced"" everyone that she was the one to destroy the wheel, she meant literally in more than one way.

As Jon Snow became more and more a legend by returning to life, battling the wights and inspiring others at every chance.    He even convinced Varys who lost his life. 

This is where it all begins to come together.   Dany the entire time had no intention of making Kingslanding and it's people bow to her.   She believed what her father died saying.. ""Burn them  all!"".    Dany had a moment when she was holding back, until the bells wouldn't ring.  As she say there watching and waiting, she realized she was all alone, the people wouldn't accept her and that she had to show everyone who has the power.. she unleashed hell when the bells finally triggering her release, this time no one or anything was standing in her way.

Arya comes into play now, all she has been through and accomplished, we see and believe Arya is meant to kill Dany to full fill the Redwomans visions...but as we have seen before, the Redwoman has been wrong.  The prophecy of Azor Ahai is being presented to us, but leaving distractions all around to take away from it.   


Arya is going to attempt to kill Dany, but fail.   In the process of this Drogon is going to kill Arya as she tries to go after Dany.    With Jon trying to fight Drogon off he is thrown leaving him laying on the ground near Dany.   Arya yells to Jon to finish what needs to be done and Jon pins Dany against a wall.   Fighting himself for his love of Dany, Jon turns and apologises as he cast his sword into her, killing her.    Jon's sword turns to fire as Drogon turns to Jon, awaiting one final battle, Drogon sees Dany lying dead and flies away.     

Jon takes on the Aegon becoming a king of the people but disbanding the 7 kingdoms to rule and protect them selves.  The iron thrown laus empty under ash never to be sat along again.   
Tyrion leaves and heads to Dorn, Sir Davos asks to remain and help Aegon.    Our final scene cuts away to Samwell writing this for the citadel, many years after the kingdoms have remained quite without the rule of a King/Queen .....the Game of Thrones was played by all, and ended by the last true King",4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bpje84/spoilers_how_it_all_will_end/,2019-05-17 02:54:26

In the first teaser we see all the Starks in the crypt with their statues ( wich symbolize the death of the Starks ) except the Bran’s statue. And don’t say that it was only to promote the battle of winterfell, because after all Sansa was there too and she doesn’t fight…

Later in the teaser aftermath it is possible to see several Stark objects ( Jon’s and Arya’s sword ) lost in supposed snow in winterfell. It is also possible to see the Bran’s wheelchair broken on stairs, and for what reason Bran’s chair would be broken on stairs? In the final scene of the teaser it is possible to see the Jon’s longclaw lost in supposed snow, and in the background a dark figure identical to the night king leaving winterfell. And if this we all thought was snow, could be ashes as well? When Bran had the vision of the throne with snow, we all thought that winter would have arrived to king’s landing, which we saw not happened. What if now the game is about to turn? If ashes will bring the night king back as Bran Stark. On the teasers, Bran’s statue has not appeared in the crypt and his wheelchair is broken on the stairs. Will he be the only Stark who will survive and prove to be the Night King, to “save” Westeros from this destruction? Will we see Bran leaving his chair and going out of winterfell to conquer Westeros?

It only remains 1 episode and that would be funny to happen, at least it wouldn’t be a really bad way to end the show, with a plot twist that nobody expected now, but it was revealed to us on the teasers.

When the ashes fall the king returns….

231,bosmy1,[Spoilers] So am I crazy for thinking the ultimate theme behind Game of Thrones is history always repeats itself?,"In the end, through all the journey that is Game of Thrones, nothing has actually changed. They are all just as fucked up as before, just living a bit different. If you think all the way back to the beginning of the first season, it opens up with the White Walkers making their presence known to the Nights Watch. The Night King knew they were going to send men beyond the wall looking for the missing rangers. When the White Walker beheaded the ranger, he tossed the head to the sole survivor with the intent of having him tell the others. The Night King chose to reveal his existence at that moment for a reason that never really was revealed. So now we jump forward, knowing the history of the Targaryens conquering Kings Landing and Westoros, followed by Robert's Rebellion many many years later. Always a fight to be on top, to sit on the Iron Throne. Always an infinite lust for greed and power. ""This one's on top, then this one's on top, and on and on it spins...""

 Now you flash to present time, Daenarys seemingly goes Mad Queen and burns all of kings Landing just for fear to rule the 7 kingdoms. Effectively making her worst than her father the literal ""Mad King"". He may have wanted to burn them all but never actually got the chance.

 Now we jump to Sansa, who on face value does what she does to protect her family, but in many scenes it is implied her lust for power when Jon was chosen to rule Winterfell over her. She always undermined and pushed back against Jon, which made it obvious she thought she would be a better ruler and they are actual family or implied. Which I'm not saying she's wrong in her believing she would be a better ruler, she would be. My point being here is no matter what happens, there will always be a player in the Game.

 Even if in the end, all the good guys end up on top, and all seems to be saved in the Kingdom, time always unravels itself. Everything always Rinses and repeats. In 1000 years, who's to say there won't be another Rebellion or another good guy turned bad? What actually changed to make things different? In my eyes, nothing. I dont see it happening either. In my mind, I believe it is much more likely we will get a deeper glimpse into what Bran sees in his visions. Bran still has a twist to be revealed, and I think it may well be Bran revealing that no matter what anybody does or tries to do, the future will always be the same. Which would be in line with what the Original 3ER was trying to teach Bran by saying, ""The past is already written, the ink is dry"". Meaning, no matter what you try to change in the past, you will have no effect on the future. Doing so will only distort time, and have tragic effects such as poor Hodor. 

In the conclusion of the story, I feel it is very possible for the story to end exactly where it began by Bran to revealing the need to have a dark looming threat (Night King) , to make sure humanity doesnt consume itself as it has been since the beginning of time. It would explain why Bran has been so emotionless ever since he has taken on being the 3ER. Imagine knowing against all else, no matter what they do they were always doomed to kill eachother from the start. And in the end, what they thought to be the true Evil and Villain of the story turned out to be the one ironically keeping them together. Ultimately further proving what the Children of The Forrest told us from the beginning.

233,bom4og,"[SPOILERS] In Defense of Daenerys, the Starks are Not Heroes","The Starks and Lannisters are responsible for the burning of King’s Landing, and Daenerys only did what she had to do with the options she had left. 

Let’s start with the premise that Daenerys has the power to destroy all of Westeros if she wants to, and she’s had that power from the moment she set foot on the continent.  We have now seen that this is true. She is a force of nature, no less than the Night King.  If she can destroy the world, then how is she any different from a God?  She is a being superior to the peasants of Westeros, who are like ants before her power. Her claim to the throne cannot be stopped.  The options for the Starks, Lannisters, and everyone else were to help Daenerys become Queen in the best way possible, or the worst way possible. 

Did they act as if these were their choices?  Or did their small minds fail to appreciate her power and act as if they were the ones with the power to decide how events would transpire?  They acted as if her power was theirs. They celebrated Jon Snow when the power behind his victory was hers. It was her dragonglass, her dragons, and her armies. 

Daenerys knew her immense and unstoppable power the whole time, but look back and consider how she wielded it.  She listened to her advisors, who counseled her to seek a more peaceful end to the war.  However, Cersei simply would not allow that to happen, and her advisors caused her to suffer defeat after defeat. Her only defeats. 

When the threat of the Night King was revealed to her, she sacrificed a dragon to save Jon Snow (because she fell in love with him). She saved all of humanity from destruction by joining the Battle of Winterfell, losing Jorah Mormont and her Dothraki — who she loves — in the process. The delay from those events allowed Cersei to create weapons that killed her second dragon and caused her best friend to be murdered in front of her.  (Also based on her advisors asking her to try to sue for peace.)

But, after humanity is saved and Daenerys returns to her rightful, unstoppable claim to the throne, she is stifled at every turn by the disloyal Starks. The Starks are like the traitorous, conniving, self-serving shitbags that brought down Ned Stark. 

If Daenerys is a God, the Starks represent the small-minded masses and the self-delusions they tell themselves to feel better than they are.  The Starks make stupid and self-serving decisions but cloak them in honor or other bullshit, when really they just act out of emotion and self-interests. 

Jon Snow is an idiot.  He’s a sock puppet. He didn’t need to tell his sisters the most incendiary secret in all of Westeros (that he has a claim to the throne). But, it was more important to Jon Snow for his sisters to love him than to protect his Queen. He acted just like Theon when he chose his first family over his new one. Jon chose his Stark family over his Targaryen one. 

Daenerys plainly told Jon Snow what would happen if he told Sansa — that the people of Westeros and those who play the “Game of Thrones” will prefer him whether he likes it or not, and that without the love of the people she would have no good options left to rule. Her greatest power — her dragons — are no power at all unless the people can see their power. 

But he was too stupid to listen. He literally “knows nothing.”  He closed his eyes to the result of his actions because he was too ignorant to appreciate the consequences. Whether he understood it or not, his actions caused violence. 

Not to mention that Jon Snow used Daenerys, claiming to love her, then rejected her affection and took everything from her.  By the way, this is exactly what he did to Ygritte!  

Jon Snow may never have been a bastard, but he’s always been an asshole. 

If Jon Snow had married Daenerys, she could have won Westeros in a traditional political alliance that would have brought a generation of prosperity to everyone. But Jon Snow is like his father — he’s too fucking stupid to shut his mouth about incest even when it would save lives.  His block-headed move is to fall on some sense of honor.  

So, since he doesn’t want to be in love with Daenerys, Jon Snow effectively reveals his claim to the throne and he made it so that the claim was his alone. There is no place for Daenerys in Jon Snow’s claim to the throne. 

He thought that just by whining that he “doesn’t want it” that would absolve him of responsibility for undermining her claim. He was told that this information would take a life of its own, making it so that the people would never accept Daenerys as Queen, but he felt ok about that because he personally didn’t want that inevitable result to happen.  Stupid.

Sansa learned from Little Finger to try and take power by trickery and deception. She doesn’t respect Daenerys in the slightest and actively works against her, with her only motive being that she wants the power for her family.  Arya says she doesn’t like Daenerys because she is not one of them.  The Starks think they are God’s gift, just like the Lannisters and every family. But if there is a God and it has a gift, it’s Daenerys and the fucking dragon that Daenerys is riding!

After Sansa tells Tyrion, both of Daenerys’ top advisors themselves support Jon Snow instead of her!  How is she supposed to believe that random people of Westeros are going to support her when even her own people would not?  

And why would she allow these people who have taken everything from her have the chance to take her last thing she cares about — the throne?

She makes it clear that if Jon Snow will not marry her, then she will have to rule not through love but through fear. She sees that her power is not respected, and needs to demonstrate that all of these lesser beings need to shut up and fall in line.  

When she says this, Jon Snow just thinks sanctimoniously about how he did the right thing because he’s a man of honor.  He killed thousands of people, even though the inevitable repercussions will be through the act of another. That doesn’t absolve him of fault. 

As far as the destruction of King’s Landing and how this shows Daenerys is “unfit” to be Queen — Do you really think that if the Starks had a dragon, they wouldn’t have used it for maximum destruction after their father was killed?  They were consumed by a thirst for revenge for their father’s execution, but they couldn’t do much about it. I’ll be damned if they didn’t use every single resource they had to pursue it though. 

As far as Arya Stark being horrified by Daenerys, lets not forget that she made an entire House of people eat their own murdered family and then poisoned them all, because she wanted revenge.  That is disgusting, cruel, unnecessary, and did nothing to bring back her loved ones.  

Tyrion Lannister murdered his own father and choked his ex-lover to death, because he wanted revenge. 

Are we to expect Daenerys, the one with all the power, to be the one to fall on her sword because of the bad decisions of others?  To allow the people of Westeros to love another, to be divided amongst loyalties, to be under constant threat from traitors in her midst, when she has the power to squash all these people like ants? 

If Daenerys is guilty for taking power this way, then so are the ones who caused this to be the only way for Daenerys to truly win Westeros.  

As far as killing innocent lives:  In retrospect, doesn’t it seem like Jon Snow, the Starks, the Lannisters, and many others could have saved innocent lives by supporting Daenerys instead of undermining her?",13,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bom4og/spoilers_in_defense_of_daenerys_the_starks_are/,2019-05-14 21:48:53

237,bon4mt,[SPOILERS] How i would have liked GoT to end after S8E5,"Danny burns King’s Landing to ashes, executes Tyrion for treason (letting Jaime escape).

Jon revolts against Danny’s actions. News that Jon is the true heir spreads. Danny decides to execute Jon.

Just before Jon’s execution, Arya saves Jon by changing identity, both escape to Winterfell. Danny tries to capture them, but fails.

Danny declares war against Winterfell and Sansa. Prepares her army to attack.

Jon and Arya reach Winterfell. They come to know about Danny’s plan to destroy them. So they resort to the only possible way to defend themselves ....

... like how the children of the forest did to protect themselves against the first men

**Pre-final scene (King’s Landing) :** Danny starts with dragon, unsullied and Dothraki to finish Winterfell. **Fire** in her eyes.

**Final scene (Godswood, Winterfell) :** The four stark children around the tree. Bran and Sansa watching, Jon against the tree ... Arya plunges a dragonglass into Jon’s heart ... Jon’s eyes turns **Blue**.

(Playing Ramin Djawadi’s “The Night King” in the background mixed with Stark music)

I don’t think the old Brandon Stark is completely gone and just the raven, and with his Hodor episode he clearly can manipulate time.  If he went back and stopped Roberts rebellion (perhaps killing the mad king early, or incapacitating Robert), then the sequence of events in the show would never take place.  Jon snow (Aegon) would be the heir to the iron throne. All the starks would be alive, Dany would be Jon’s aunt and have her own family.  And finally.... the white walkers and the night king would be alive again. Likely with the memory of what happened considering his supernatural status.  (At least the wall would be up).  It will be a tough choice to make, but Bran may make it at the last second if Dany chooses to burn the world.",24,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bo6gab/spoilers_bran_changes_the_timeline/,2019-05-13 21:27:58
252,boekbt,[SPOILERS] The only way to redeem this season (fan theory),"I'm hoping that the whole last episode was actually just a vision Bran shared with John about what *could* happen. This will cause John to kill Dany himself. Bran will then wharg a dragon (possibly the last remaining dragon if killing Dany happens after dragon death) to help John take King's landing. 

Solves for several things:
 - could explain why the John/Aegon reveal to his siblings happened off screen (everything after that is Bran telling the group what'll happen if they share the news)
- confirms long held fan theory that Dany is ""Nissa Nissa"" + the new ""mad king"" and John has to kill her
-  gives boring Bran an actual purpose in the show 
- fulfills the 3 eyed raven prophesy ""you will fly"" 
- gives Dany's character a tiny shred of maintained dignity (she didn't really go crazy and kill all those people)
- can undo a myriad of plain old stupidity (John keeps ghost, Jamie doesn't leave etc.)

256,boc0h5,[spoilers] This Sucks,"So, obviously I have a few dozen issues with this episode—but, the conclusion is that it, in its purest essence, destroyed years of work and buildup. If you have been a book-reader from Day One, you’ve just had some three-plus decades blown to kingdom come.

After thinking it all through, I think the largest, most egregious, most inimitable unforgivable sin is what they did to conclude Jaime’s arc. I refer you to the fan-made video below called Oathbreaker. It is one of those lovely, cinematic complication pieces featuring great moments and lines, set to some touchingly emotional score by a Explosions-In-The-Sky-type rising score.

It concludes with Ser Jaime’s line about how the pages of the Kingsguard Book still have blank space enough and time enough to be filled with his great deeds.

I think we all sincerely believed this. His ultimate heel-turn back to Cersei is just . . . I don’t even know what to call it other than treason of character and story. It is so purely and insufferably wrong, I sincerely don’t know what to even feel at this moment in time.

I’m not a book-reader myself. But, I am steeped deeply in the lore and background of ASoIaF, in just about every way. And, I am appalled.

No prophecy-fulfillment; no resurrection of morality; no goodness shown; not even any bad-ass-ery. Just a meaningless and truly unnecessary fight with Euron and then a death-by-falling-rubble.

He didn’t kill Cersei. He didn’t stop her evil ways. He didn’t even try to talk about turning over a new leaf. He just hugged her as they died.

It was astoundingly rushed and forced, and of course entirely wrong for the character. Even Cersei deserved a better ending than a few thousand pounds of bricks cascading on her.

A few other relative-to-that-awfulness gripes: A. Why in the holy seven fucks was Davos 1. complicit in breaking out Jaime; and 2. at the vanguard of the attack?! He has repeatedly announced his incompetence with a sword and in battle—other than in a strategic, field general manner. And, he’s on the front lines??

B. Why did Dany suddenly figure out the cheat codes for Drogon \ dragon combat? I’ve reference before that it just didn’t seem that dragons were actually all that fantastic of weapons—as we’ve seen two die by spears. Heck, the second was literally killed by just a guy. On a boat. But, now b/c of rage (?), Dany can just pull off this perfectly scripted and executed attack pattern?

C. Why bother doing the hoop-jumping of evening out the opposing sides forces to “roughly equal” just to have the Lannister side annihilated within mere minutes?? The Golden Company got a nearly comedic send-off. There could’ve been a rimshot when Homeless Harry gets harpooned by Grey Worm. (Also, why did half a dozen Dothraki ride past without decapitating him? It’s not as if GW had a personal vendetta against Harry Strickland, and therefore made that kill meaningful to him, personally.)

D. Speaking of GW, why did he throw a spear at the surrendering army? I understand his rage and anger. But, did he discuss this with his queen beforehand? I was under the impression that if the city was falling and the opposing forces surrendering (with the bells tolling), the idea was then a peaceful ending. And, it was just Dany’s rage \ madness that sent her on the killing spree.

Did GW just act independently? Or, was this plotted out in advance?

E. Speaking of the surrender and whatnot: Why in the fucking fuck did the erstwhile-decent and good soldiers of the North and the ultra-disciplined Unsullied decide to slaughter innocents?! And rape and pillage?? The Unsullied obviously have no use for the former—and hardly the latter.

Why oh f’ing why did these guys suddenly just turn into the worst persons on Planetos?!! It makes literally zero sense. Is it b/c Dany did? Well, she literally was killing plenty of her own by the end—which also is galling and makes zero sense.

F. Why didn’t Dany fly straightaway to the giant bullseye-painted tower that was holding her ultimate enemy as soon as she had the chance??

I could go through the alphabet and alphanumerics until it looks like the mythical end of a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet . . . . issues such as how absurd The Mountain looked (like a somehow worse version of an old Hulk movie); what TM’s abilities and limits are; why they had to use yet-another reused thing with the eye\skull-crush. Arya not being allowed to quietly assassinate the queen. The cleverest and sneakiest man in the show’s history not even attempting to mount a defense against treason; why Tyrion wasn’t also burned; why Jon wasn’t also. Why did Arya suddenly become a bumbling dummy who was no better at escaping or hiding than anyone else? Why every single person—especially soldiers on both sides—didn’t immediately flee the city upon seeing the deliberately performed carpet-bombing, block by block? Why didn’t Sandor kill Cersei? Why did Q’Byrn (sic, I’m sure—and I just don’t care enough any longer) have his story arc end with a comic Pratt fall? Why haven’t we received any payoff to any of the singular theories and prophecies???!!

Why oh fucking why, why, why, why, why?!!??!!!!?!

Fuck this show. Fuck this show so bad. Sigh. I am so sorry we have to deal with this nuclear winter that is coming. Hey: A new slug-line for the show!!

259,bny23x,"[SPOILERS] I don't hate the most hated female characters, I feel sorry for them.","Half-expecting some downvotes for this post, but I wanted to get this off my chest because it's been bothering me more than it should. After browsing the reddit, I can see that Cersei and Daenerys are some of the most hated female characters in the show that a lot of fans want dead. People definitely have some valid reasons for hating them. While it's true Cersei has done way more harm than good, I don't envy the life that she's had. I know, I know: ""She is the cause of most of her own suffering, she never learns and she deserves to rot!"" But that's exactly *why* I feel sorry for her. Same goes for Daenerys. Let's do a quick side-by-side comparison of the tragic upbringings both these women had.

Cersei:

* her mother dies giving birth to her dwarf brother
* craves her father's approval but he neglects her emotionally
* father psychologically abuses her simply for being born a woman as he believes women are weaker than men
* father's more preoccupied with getting/keeping the throne and having the most power than caring for and loving his children
* father forces her to marry Robert Baratheon for a foothold on the iron throne
* develops alcoholism to cope with abuse
* craves love so badly she allows unhealthy incestuous relationship with her twin brother
* grows up to adopt the same values that were important to her father which is iron throne > family/love
* grows up to be ""cold"", aloof, selfish, generally incapable of displaying warmth and affection, and unable to learn from past mistakes

Daenerys:

* both parents dead by the time she's born
* raised poor and alone by her brother because the rest of her family is dead
* brother is obsessed with vengeance plot to take back the iron throne and have the Lannisters & Baratheons executed for committing treason against the Targaryens
* brother emotionally abuses her by treating her like a piece of property instead of like family
* brother sexually harasses her
* brother forces her at 13 years of age to wed Khal Drogo so that he can have Dothraki army to help him get back the iron throne
* gets raped by Khal on wedding night
* brother emotionally abuses her into submitting to his will
* finally rages and has her only living sibling killed
* grows up to adopt the same values that were important to her brother which is iron throne > family/love
* grows up to be ""cold"", aloof, has entitlement issues, has abandonment issues due to most of her lineage being dead, has delusional messiah complex, and intense rage triggers

That's when fans try to compare Cersei and Dany to Sansa and Arya. They say ""That's no excuse! Look at Sansa and Arya. They've been through hell and back and they're still stable, grounded women!"" OK, but both Sansa and Arya came from loving families and loving homes. Their parents loved them dearly and instilled wholesome family-oriented values in them. They taught their children that love and family come first. That's also why Bran and Jon turned out so great. Sansa and Arya survived the horrific abuse they faced because no matter how bad things got, the love they received in childhood and the values they were taught kept them from falling to pieces. If Sansa and Arya had the dysfunctional upbringings that Cersei and Dany had, this would be a much different and much darker story. All of Cersei and Dany's behavioral issues are the result of the kind of environment they were raised in. So I don't hate Cersei and Dany. I hate the environment that molded them and other abused women like them.

Edit: It just irritates me to see in the GoT communities that Sansa and Arya are ""better women"" than Cersei and Dany because they made better choices. But with the sort of tragic upbringings Cersei and Dany had, how can anyone expect them to make better choices than the ones who came from good upbringings with loving families? These women were doomed from the moment that they started being abused as children. Dany tried to learn from her abusive past and make better choices for a little while, but once everyone she cared about is killed and the majority of people she trusted in betrayed her, these things kept piling on one after another until she has a complete mental breakdown. Now she believes that humanity has always been inherently evil (thanks to all the abuse she endured since childhood) and that humanity must burn. If that doesn't create the feeling of sorrow and compassion caused by suffering and the misfortunes of others, then I don't know what does.",16,222,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bny23x/spoilers_i_dont_hate_the_most_hated_female/,2019-05-13 07:12:37

It was made clear that no one loves her, Jon doesn't love her. She is aware that everyone fears her. So after the rejection she got from Jon, she literally says fine fear it is. Now think about it, Cersei didn't show dany any mercy, she ordered her dragons to be killed (I have no fucking idea how Rhaegal died like a little bitch - the showrunners are cunts) and ordered the execution of missande, so to Dany it became personal. It wasn't just about reclaiming the 7 kingdoms it was also about destroying all her enemies that have personally attack her. That's why Varys got toasted at the beginning of the episode. I haven't read all the books (in the process of going through them now, but in the show danerys and cersei's characters were supposed to be mirrored, except dany was being put in check by her advisors, and cersei eventually had no one to put her in check.

But the way they filmed it seemed deliberate. I think maybe the Lord of lights magic that was keeping Jon alive from his stab wounds will die out now that if the night king is dead. John has served his purpose. I don't think he'll die until after episode 5 but it is definitely a possibility he doesn't seem to have much stake in this fight with cersi. this could also be why ghost was sent back to the wall since that is and should be the actual resting place of Jon. Also rhaegal died and rhaegal was jons dragon. None of the Starks or the targaryens ""pets"" have died until there human either died or stopped being an honorable Stark/Targaryen. Obviously Jon is the definition of honor. I think John is a Dead Man walking and could literally die at any moment.  
Also Jon is with davos and davos would understand what is happening when Jon collapses. 
It's also possible that rhaegals death parallels jons where Jon's stab wounds slow him down on the battlefield and he gets killed.

288,bnevdi,[SPOILERS] Sam's Vision in the Flames during The Battle of Winterfell,"&#x200B;

This is at about the 20 minute mark in “The Long Night,” as Sam & Edd are come upon by the dead. Sam is knocked to the ground, saved by Edd, but then remains there in a haze. 

We see a POV shot from Sam looking through the FLAMES at a silhouette of who seems to be Jaime Lannister fighting in the battle against hostile soldiers, also silhouetted. 

Jamie’s first two attack’s that we see seem to be made with both hands, but the third appears to be made by way of his RIGHT HAND alone. From Sam’s POV shot, we’re looking at Jaime’s back during that third attack, as he pulls back his right arm to then stab the enemy before him. 

I believe what Sam is seeing is actually a vision of the future through the flames from The Lord of Light, showing Jaime fighting as The Prince that was Promised in “The Last War” with the ancient sword “Lightbringer” in the form of pure flame in his right hand. 

After this, Sam gets up and watches Edd die before looking a dead woman in the face and fleeing the battle. His fear could of course be explained by any number of things - but having seen an otherworldly vision in that moment could have been part of what finally pushed Sam over the edge. 

*Some might argue that the camera is facing Jaime from a different angle but I don’t believe that’s true. By having been shot this way, the scene also cleverly blocks Jaime’s actual right hand from view. We only see the arm make the action, and so his hand stays hidden.*

&#x200B;

END OF MAIN THEORY - more explanation of Jaime as TPTWP and “Lightbringer” below

&#x200B;

——————————————————————

&#x200B;

The Lightbringer aspect of the theory comes from Season 4 Episode 5 “First of His Name” when Bran, Jojen, Meera, and Hodor are captives of Karl Tanner. 

&#x200B;

“This isn’t the end. Not for you. Not yet” - Jojen 

“How will we know?” - Meera 

\* Jojen’s right hand ignites in flames \* 

“You’ll know.” - Jojen 

&#x200B;

I believe that when Jaime eventually kills Cersei it will fulfill the Valonquar prophecy from Maggy the Frog, and also The Prince that was Promised prophecy by plunging the blade into Cersei, Jaime’s one true love (a sacrifice) 

&#x200B;

The prophecy fulfilled, Jaime’s right hand will ignite in flames into what will be Lightbringer, the ancient sword of story. 

&#x200B;

299,bn4yfn,[Spoilers] I haven't really been watching since Season 4,"I've still been following the show, watching odd episodes, but I stopped consistently watching it in season 4.

Part of it was not having a lot of time, so it didn't make the cut. But I also stopped implicitly trusting the rollercoaster the writers were taking me on. This is a matter of opinion of course, but for me that feeling was creeping in the whole season, but was cemented by the scene where Olly kills Ygritte in ""The Watchers on the Wall"".

The whole tearing them apart on opposite sides of a war for survival was good drama. But the way it happened, and in particular the character of Olly, felt cheap and unrealistic, more a form of punchy sadism than even malicious tragedy. I don't really know why it stood out at the time, but it just seemed out of place to me.

Later I read this quote from the wiki:
> Writer's assistant Dave Hill... suggested to Benioff and Weiss that Olly join the Night's Watch, because he had nowhere else to go, and to kill Ygritte during the Battle of Castle Black for dramatic sense. Benioff and Weiss were so impressed with this suggestion that they promoted Hill to write an episode script in Season 5

And it confirmed that I'd gotten off the ride about where I could handle it.

I bring this up because the scene in the recent episode where one of the dragons died gave me the same impression, but seemed 10x more garish. Tragedy aside, the immediate impression was that it broke step with the drama. It felt cheap.

I don't know why exactly I want to share it, I've been fans of franchises before where studio appointed writers, maybe meant to counter-balance the influence of the creator, take the franchise towards their own vision when they get control. It seems like any time you're creating stories in ""someone else's universe"", it becomes easy to take for granted how much the integrity of the original ideas built that world, and how deviations with a short term payoff ultimately hurt the overall narrative.

Anyways it's been said before. But as an older fan kind of coming back for the finale, it's a little bit bitter, but at the same time something that we've seen building for a few seasons. There's a lot of good left though so I'll still keep on it.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bn4yfn/spoilers_i_havent_really_been_watching_since/,2019-05-11 02:48:33
300,bmqy6s,[SPOILERS] Trying to make sense of the Bran and Knight King story lines,"Like so many people, this season has been a massive disappointment for me so far. Not bc the episodes are not entertaining (they are), but bc it has been rushed, forced, and sloppy IMO. Seasons 7-8 could have / should have spanned over 5 seasons probably. The time lapses between scenes are unrealistic, unearned and unfortunate.  We have been waiting years to see how the Starks would react to Jon being a Targaryen, and we don’t even see him deliver the news?  Anyway... not the point of this thread.  We have been waiting since the opening scene of S1 E1 to learn what the point of the WW’s and the Night King are. Also for years to learn what the purpose of Bran as the Three Eyed Raven was and how it ties into the Night King. Was “The Long Night” an incredibly entertaining episode?  Absolutely!  But did it leave you wanting answers?  ABSOLUTELY?  And WTF was Bran doing?  Why has the NK been so obsessed with finding him?  What does the mark on Bran’s arm represent?  Why the hell was it relevant for Bran to talk about a 120 year old Targaryen wheelchair?  Does any of it make sense?  It could and it should, but D&D abruptly killed the Night King (awesome scene for Arya and totally earned, but not yet) and are not giving us enough time to find out the rest I don’t think.  Here’s a thought:

What if Bran’s tie to the Night King and the whole story for that matter is that neither had all of their powers while the other existed.  The Three Eyed Raven could see the past, present, and future and the Night King could raise the dead, but neither could do both. The NK was obsessed with changing history and needed that power so he was trying to kill the 3ER. Now that the NK is gone, Bran can now actually raise the dead and that Jon’s Targaryen/Stark lineage ties him to Bran and in turn Bran to the Targaryen and now Bran can raise the dead dragons under the Red Keep and he does and they crush Cersei and The Golden Company and send Westeros back to the Dragon era?!  Long shot, but it might explain why Bran and Daenerys had the same vision of the Throne Room empty and in ashes.",4,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bmqy6s/spoilers_trying_to_make_sense_of_the_bran_and/,2019-05-10 03:29:42

304,bmesjc,[SPOILERS] Cersei's Actions in S8E4 Were In Canon with Her Character. Am I the Only One Who Thinks This...?,"Everyone everywhere is complaining about why Cersei didn’t just kill Dany and her small regiment of guards during their exchange of terms/Missandei’s execution. This is an obvious thing to do from a war perspective, but to me, it’s totally in canon with Cersei’s character not to take this “easy” way out. Cersei doesn’t like just killing her enemies, she likes to torture them and make them suffer to their breaking point; that’s where she gets her pleasure from (or at least the thought of it when it applies). She did this with Septa Unella and Ellaria; she said how “no thought has given [her] greater joy” when imagining the terror people experienced before being blown up in the Sept; she threw a bitchfit when she realized Olenna died peacefully and not “screaming” (granted, after she finds out Olenna was responsible for Joffrey’s demise).

With all of this history in consideration along with the knowledge of Cersei’s mentally sadistic personality, it makes perfect sense to me that she wanted to “torture” Dany and elicit a reaction out of her. It’s a power move and killing her right after the “torture” would’ve been too easy. To echo Tywin, Cersei always thinks she smarter than she is (hell, sometimes she actually is though) so she thinks she’s easily going to kill Dany after Dany tries to retaliate.

Of course, you can write this off as D&amp;amp;D’s lazy and bloated writing (so many other examples of that) but I don’t know, this one just kind of seemed in character for Cersei. Does anyone else think this or am I alone here?",4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bmesjc/spoilers_cerseis_actions_in_s8e4_were_in_canon/,2019-05-09 07:14:18

What's curious is, this was right after he pulls up a chair to listen to some ""long story"" that Bran has to tell.

I wonder what they spoke. I also wonder if Tyrion meant the war with the dead or the war with Cersei when he said ""we will survive"".

Watch the scene to refresh your memory. Notice how Tyrion kinda scoffs...

311,blquyt,>!Spoilers!< Poor explanation as to why Gendry called himself ‘Gendry Rivers’ and not ‘Waters.’,"So as you may know in the show there’s a bit of a plot hole. Gendry, upon being legitimized, goes to Arya and tells her that he is no longer Gendry Rivers, but Gendry Baratheon. Many are confused and angry because he was born in the crown lands and should have the surname ‘Waters’. However it is Westerosi custom that bastards of noble lords are named after where they are raised and not where they are born. ( Jon Snow) Furthermore, Gendry was never even recognized by Robert Baratheon, so he would not be given a surname.

However we see Gendry leave King’s Landing in season 1 to join the Night’s Watch. They make their journey North, but after Yoren and the others being killed, Gendry, Arya, and Hot-pie travel around the Riverlands. They are held prisoner in Harrenhaal by the Lannisters and they have a brief run-in with the Brotherhood. This is a big adventure for just a group of teenagers. (Keep note of that) 

Eventually Gendry is taken by Melissandre, finds out about his father and him being a bastard. Eventually Ser Davos frees him from Dragonstone and tells him to hide from the Lannisters. 

Gendry’s plan is to hide right under the nose of the Lannisters. Now that he’s on his own he would likely want a name for himself. However, by saying his name was Gendry Waters, this would be a little suspicious as all the bastards of Robert were hunted down. So he may have chosen the surname Rivers for 2 reasons. 1: To throw off the Lannisters by making them think he’s a bastard raised in the Riverlands. 2: Because the adventures he undertook with Arya and Hot-pie and the Brotherhood were defining moments in his life, and matured him into being a man. So perhaps he feels he was truly given a sense of belonging in the Riverlands, and this gave himself the name Gendry Rivers.

Anyways that’s my thoughts on the matter. I’m not saying that it was or wasn’t a mistake in the show, but i think these explanations do justify it a bit.",51,283,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/blquyt/spoilers_poor_explanation_as_to_why_gendry_called/,2019-05-07 17:42:53

314,bm0mik,[SPOILERS] Re-Watched S8E3,"Re-watched S8Ep3

Okay, so after rewatching I have more empathy for Daenerys. I mean if she didn’t get on Drogon and go rain fire down when the heap of dead were at the front they would have never been able to hold them off for as long. Daenerys was fighting for her people and while we (the audience) see her kinda start unraveling (though she has been going through some rough shit lately) there is no reason that Sansa should be being the Bitch to her she has been from the start. Even in the crypt she has a snide remark to Tyrion about why they wouldn’t work out because of his loyalty to The Dragon Queen and Messandri, rightfully so, says, yes we would have nothing to worry about because we all would be dead of it wasn’t for the Dragon Queen.


To me it just shows me more reason that Sansa only told Tyrion the secret in Ep4 for her own personal gain and to stir the (chaos) pot.

- Someone to Sansa while talking about Cersei, you seem like you admire her. Sansa-“ I learned a lot from her”

Little finger before he was killed - “Thank you for the many lessons you have taught me”

Also little finger told her - “Chaos is a ladder” 

Just my personal opinion but after rewatching the episode I just felt I saw other things I missed about Daenerys as well that show she isn’t all that bad. Yes she starts unraveling more in S8Ep4.",16,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bm0mik/spoilers_rewatched_s8e3/,2019-05-08 07:57:49

323,blr7gp,[SPOILERS] Why Jamie did that thing,"First off sorry if this entry is poorly written, I'm exhausted and at work right now.

In episode 4, we see Arya finished with the great war, and telling a saddened Gendry that she intends to finish her list. We also see Jamie, fully in love with Brienne, making love and looking longingly at her. 

After that, we see nothing of Arya and Jamie completely flips the script and says he's going back to Cersei. Jamie just had a huge redemption arc, he knighted Brienne, he loved Brienne. There's no reason Jamie would go back to Kings landing. 

The only person (other than Dany and her crew) who actually said anything about going to Kings landing, and still has an arc to complete is ARYA. I say, Arya killed Jamie as part of her list after Brienne and him first had sex and used the cover of staying behind as a guest of Lady Stark to secretly make her escape to Kings Landing to murder Cersei.

TLDR: Jamie leaving Brienne makes no sense to the plot, and Arya was the only singular person with story based motive to go to Kings Landing, so it makes sense that Arya killed Jamie for his face to murder Cersei",48,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/blr7gp/spoilers_why_jamie_did_that_thing/,2019-05-07 18:14:49

340,blh0wy,GOT Pre Sentence Report: Tyrion Lannister: SPOILERS!,"  I am a Probation Officer, somewhat experienced in writing pre-sentence reports, and a big fan of GOT. Thought it would be mildly entertaining to write them on the GOT characters, if not a bit niche!.

**Game of Thrones Pre-Sentence Report**

Offender Details: Tyrion Lannister

Address: Currently No Fixed Abode

Sentencing Court: Westeros Crown Court

Purpose of Sentencing: Punishment, Reform and Rehabilitation, Public Protection

Offence details: 1x Murder

1. **Sources of Information:** Offender Assessment System, Interview with offender, Police statements and CPS documents.

**2.** **Office Analysis and Defendant Explanation:**

On the 1st of this month, Mr Lannister was found guilty of the murder of his father Tywin Lannister.

Police describe attending the victim’s home (The Royal Castle, Kings Landing) following a distressed 999 call from the victim’s daughter. On arrival they were directed to the upstairs lavatory by what they described as an ‘enraged female’ they later ascertained was Ms Cersei Lannister. Upon reaching the rest room, they were confronted with the slumped body of the victim still sat upon the toilet, with a cross bow arrow to the chest. Police statements refer to Ms Lannister screaming about how she would “find the imp and ensure he would endure a slow and painful death”. Police established that Ms Lannister was referring to her brother Tyrion Lannister, whom she said had killed their father and fled”. 

Mr Tyrion Lannister stated that he and his father had a ‘complicated past’, he said that his father had blamed him for the death of his mother (who died in child birth to him) and struggled to accept that he was born with dwarfism. Mr Lannister said that he was belittled and never felt good enough, this had resulted in a deep hatred of his father. He said that years of taunting and mental abuse had culminated, and when he saw the opportunity to end it, he took it. Police described the situation as one of the most bizarre domestic situations they had ever dealt with, and witness statements corroborating Mr Lannister’s account that he had been locked in a dungeon by his sister, and freed by his brother (Sir Jamie Lannister). 

3. **Offender Assessment** (including Accommodation, Education/Employment/Finances/Relationships/Attitude/Thinking and Behaviour/Associates/Substance Misuse and Emotional Wellbeing):

· Mr Lannister said that he has always lived with his family, despite his contempt for them most of the time. He has travelled and stayed in the families’ other properties when things get too much at home. Accommodation is linked to the offence in that the risk of serious domestic violence and disagreements are likely to occur when he is living at home.

· In terms of education, he said that he was educated well and that for all his shortcomings, he at least appreciated his father’s investment in that. When asked about his qualifications, Mr Lannister smirked and said that he had a PHD in International Politics and Diplomacy, and a doctorate in ‘whoring’. He seemed to take a great deal of pride in describing his most recent employment of personal advisor and hand of the Queen, he said that she would give a decent character reference, and both this and his service to the seven kingdoms should be taken in to account when sentencing. Education and employment are not assessed as linked to the index offence.

· With regards to finances, Mr Lannister said that his savings were all tied up in investments, that his sister had control over the family estate and has preferential treatment with the Iron Bank. On a positive note, he said that he has no debt as he has always ensured these were paid. It would appear that whilst his current lifestyle is very basic in comparison to years gone by, he is financially secure and most of this has been inherited over the generations, though there are some concerns that some of this wealth could have been obtained through illegal means linked to other offences. I do not assess finances as being linked to the index offence.

· He described his family as ‘complicated’ and ‘dysfunctional’, and always feeling like the outsider, with his brother and sister being extremely close. He felt that he missed out on his mother not being around, and harboured guilt for her death. His relationships with his siblings have always been turbulent, and despite his hatred for his father, it would seem that they had all wanted to meet their father’s high expectations, and this had caused conflict between them. He described a string of one night stands with sex workers, which I assess to be linked to his lack of acceptance within his own family, low self-esteem, and a need for intimacy elsewhere. When questioned along these lines, he became defensive and said that it was an ‘enjoyable hobby’ and nothing more. When asked if he had any serious relationships, he paused and said that he was married once, to a red-haired lady whom he respected, but this wasn’t to be. He said that there had never been any violence within his intimate relationship and that he had just wanted her to be happy. He said they parted suddenly after attending a wedding that ‘got a bit out of hand’. I assess relationships to be strongly related to risk of harm and the index offence.

· When asked if he had many friends, Mr Lannister said that he had many acquaintances, but few he would call friends. He said that he has recently reconciled his differences with his brother and that he has one close friend called Varys. He says that Varys was a good support and keen ornithologist, and that he too had suffered a difficult past. He said they have recently had differences of opinion at work, but he hopes they can resolve it without violence. Mr Lannister appears wary of trusting many, perhaps due to a justified concern for self-preservation, but in keeping people at a distance, he is somewhat isolated and left to his own thoughts. He does not appear to seek association with pro-criminal peers, and is not easily led.  Whilst building a stronger support network will be beneficial moving forward, I do not assess that it was directly linked to the offence.

· With regards to alcohol, Mr Lannister completed the Alcohol Assessment Tool, based on units consumed, this indicates a borderline dependence. It would appear that he has built up a significant tolerance, he answered yes to having frequent blackouts, being injured during periods of intoxication, and memory loss. This did not appear to concern him, he stated that this is his preferred state and he did not want to be referred to specialist services to address this. He described with some pride how he was able to match a wildling drink for drink. I would assess that Mr Lannister used alcohol from an early age as a coping mechanism in order to escape difficult family life and feels of self-loathing, and over the years this has become more habitual. Whilst currently his self-image has improved, he still feels he needs to live up to the reputation of ‘work hard, play hard’. Mr Lannister says that he has never used drugs. Mr Lannister had not consumed alcohol at the time of the offence as had been locked in a room. I do not assess alcohol as linked to offending behaviour.

· Mr Lannister presents as a witty, intelligent and charismatic individual with a great deal of control over his thinking and behaviour. Whilst there may have been an element of impulsiveness to his behaviour in the way that the opportunity to commit murder presented itself, I assess that his choice was thought through and his action was calculated. He has said that he has no regrets and would ‘do it again’. He was able to generate alternative courses of action, but was insistent that these would all lead to his own swift demise, therefore asserting that it was in fact the only logical choice. I would however assess that the circumstances of the offence were very specific, and are unlikely to present themselves again. In saying that, due to the continuing animosity between him and his sister, as well as him being at risk from her, he may feel backed in to a corner and the instinct to protect himself may result in similar actions should they meet. In general, he presents as an individual that tries to avoid physical conflict, has good temper control, is able to perspective take and show empathy. I assess that whilst thinking and behaviour was a contributing factor in the current offence, this was influenced heavily by his emotions and fear for his own safety at the time. In day to day circumstances, his thinking is more likely to defuse situations than escalate them. Where he feels there is little choice but to resort to violence however, he is capable of doing so.

4. **Summary and Proposal:** 

Mr Lannister accepts full responsibility for the murder of his father, but expresses little remorse, believing that he was driven to it and that despite his heightened emotions, it came down to survival in the end. Whilst Mr Lannister’s difficult upbringing should be taken in to consideration, it nonetheless does show capacity to use extreme violence and take the life of another. The seriousness of the offence also attracts a minimum sentencing tariff, the purpose of which would be to punish, given that the prospect of reform and rehabilitation may be limited at this time. I therefore propose that Mr Lannister is sentenced to life imprisonment. Should this sentence be imposed, I suggest that a Offending Behaviour Programme Assessment be undertaken in custody, although I have doubts on whether he will meet the minimum criteria given his lack of thinking deficits. I would also suggest that he would benefit from a period in a Therapeutic Community during his sentence.",6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/blh0wy/got_pre_sentence_report_tyrion_lannister_spoilers/,2019-05-07 00:12:37
341,blgvjx,Interesting theory about jon and dany,"Found a person on youtube with some interesting theories and one of them (linked) included the idea that dany's story will follow the same future as ygritte's, in other words that jon will betray her and she will die fighting him.

343,bldfew,I Re-wrote the battle of winterfell. Season 8 episode 3,"Season 8 episode 3..
   I’m short on time so I will just start this off on when the battle begins...because I’m short on time I will also be short details. I can make this writing way more detailed if people enjoy my take ... 
    ... camera shows the the Night kings army marching towards winterfell. You can see the torches lit from the soldiers lined up outside the castle . Camera pulls back to a birds eye view . Shows the army of the dead marching . You see a few giants scattered in the mix . Cut scene 
    . Now we have we have a front birds eye view of winterfell . You can see the army of the livng lined up for battle . Camera zooms in to the front lines . We have Tormund pounding his chest hyping up the wildlings next to him is podrick standing still just looking forward. Next to him is brienne standing tall looking to her left and her right ,With her hand on her sword in its helm. Then we move to Jamie. He takes a deep breath,  lifts his hand by bending his elbow. Where his golden hand used to be is now his valerian steel sword wielded to his arm piece . And on his side is a  dragon glass sword in its helm (Jamie will wield 2 swords in this battle ) Jamie looks at his valerian sword in admiration turning it left and right . He has a grin, you can see he’s scared but also happy to have his fighting arm back. He looks ready for a war . 
    
     The camera keeps moving in the same direction , past one half of Dothraki army who are  on horseback chanting , then we have grey worm and the unsullied stamping their staffs on the ground , after them is the Other half of the Dothraki on horseback also chanting.  
  We now see sir Jorah Mormont holding the sword given to him by Sam. Behind him are some of the the  Mormonts army. He has a proud look is his eyes. Next to Jorah is Edd lord commander of the nights watch staring straight ahead . Next is Sam, sweating looking left and right , the Same way breanne of Tarth was , except his eyes nervous and full off fear. We then have beric dondarrian lighting his sword , the hound looking straight ahead, he’s ready for these fuckers , Gendry holding a large double sided dragon glass ax moving it from hand to hand. He looks ready but also unsure .  The look on his face changes.m, he can see the army of the dead . They are here . 
    
   You can hear a dragon , it’s Jon on Rhaegal's back ..Rhaegal shoots fire right through the middle of the dead army cutting them into 2 groups . The Dothraki charge in there the opening was just created .the unsullied follow after . Then you see another dragon it’s danerys and drogon they burn through the army of the dead going from left to right . Separating  a portion of the dead from the rest of the army ( you now have a portion of the dead broken into 2 groups ) army of the living attacks the 2 groups .. 
Brieene , pod,Jamie,tormund attack the group on the left . Jorah, edd, Sam, beric, hound attack group on the right .. 
   Unsullied and Dothraki are encircling the army of the dead also. This battle is successfully,  the living win this round . 
 
  Jon come back with Rhaegal, doing the same motion as before . Burning through the army of the dead creating 2 groups . This time we see the dead generals on their horses , we also see 2 giants scattered in the mix. Dany and drogon also try the same move . As she cuts through the army of the dead (left side) you see a giant running in her direction. He takes a swing with a giant club barely misses drogon . Dany is forced to make a u turn unable to complete cutting through the dead army . She comes back around goes after the giant. 
As Drogon is buring the giant, it takes on last swing with its club and thumps drogon right across the head .. drogon goes limp starts spiraling towards the ground . 
 They crash , out of reach from the dead for now . Jon and Jorah both see this happen. Jorah jumps on a horse from a fallen Dothraki and charges towards the direction of dany . As Jon is turning towards dany, you see the night king on Viserion . He is heading towards right side of the army of the living. 
 
   We see beric , gendry , the hound and Sam fighting the dead. Thy Are starting to get over powered because drogon wasn’t able to complete burning through the crowd. Then we we see the ice king overhead , his dragon shoots ice flames into the army of the living . He destroys a large portion of the flank . Edd  calls for retreat . Pull back to the castle!  Sam turns and runs , the hound is frozen in fear gendry is fighting . Beric shakes the hound, we  have to get back to the castle! the hound snaps out of it and starts fighting .. what’s left of right side flank make it back into the castle fighting off the dead . Tryin to keep them from entering the walls . 
  
  On the left flank , Jamie is slicing through the dead using both his valerian sword and dragon glass sword he’s nearing one of the the ice generals . Breanne , pod , tormund are also fighting well .  The left flank is holding up well and winning.  But  a great number of dead are approaching from the right side. The dead are slowly starting to overpower the left flank. Then the general closest to Jamie lifts his hand the same we we have seen the night king do . When he does we see all the dead soliders stand . 
   Jamie continues slaying dead inching closer to the ice general . A soldier who has just risen is standing behind pod. Pod doesn’t see him he fighting off the dead in front of him. Breanne sees, she’s too far away to help. She shouts his name, podrick ! Behind you!  As pod turns he blocks the attack from the solider causing him to leave his side open, another dead soldier comes from pods side swings and puts a part of his sword right into pods eye.. pod goes down .. breanne sees it ... screaming , she fights her way to him..tormund also fights his way there .. pod is still alive , but he’s missing his eye.. breanne and tormund standing over pod are fighting off the dead around them , but there too many many . They are beginning to get overwhelmed . 
   Jamie who is separated from them is still fighting his way towards the general. He can see they are losing, he can hear Breinnes screams. The dead are no match for Jamie and his two swords . He looks in the direction of Breinnes screams. He sees her and tormund fighting. They can’t win, there’s too many white walkers ..he loses sight of them as they become encircled by more dead. 
 As Jamie turns you see the ice general on horseback charging him taking a swing . As Jamie turns he  blocks the attack with his valerian hand and slices the horse with his dragon glass sword . Jamie falls , drops his sword . The ice generals horse dies and falls knocking the General to the floor. Both get up, have a sword fight. Jamie wins , kills the general. All the dead that were just brought back to life , die with him along with other white walkers . Breanne and Jamie look at each other. Jamie yells head back to the castle! . Breanne and tormund pick up pod and they fight their way back to winterfell.  Grey worm and the unsullied see the left and right flank have been defeated and retreat back with Jamie, Breinne tormund and pod. 
    Jon seeing the ice king take out the right flank with ice fire , know he cannot leave and find dany. He chases after the ice king with rheagal . They have a huge dragon fight . jon on the back of rhaegal holding a shield that was strapped to his back to protect himself from ice fire . Jon knocks the ice king from viseron . Rhaegal is injured and can’t fly he lands and get get back up. 
  Jorah reaches dany. She’s alive. Drogon is starting to come back to it. As they are standing there . 3 walker generals show up on theirs horses. They were also tracking down dany and drogon. Jorah tells dany to get on her dragon . He pulls out heartsbane and gets into his stance. The generals charge Jorah . He puts up a fight . Dany watches while sitting on drogon . Jorah kills one general . Drogon is back up . Jorah turns to dany . 
 My queen go, they need you . Jorah turns to fight . He is knocked down. He gets up the two generals are on horseback on both sides of him. They charge him he blocks gets knocked down again. Dany is watching . Jorah gets up. They charge him again. He moves and swings heartsbane kills a general . Turns and sees the other generals sword coming right at his head. Thump, sir jorahs head falls to the floor. Danny screams , crying.. the ice general is looking he her. She has to react . She gets drogon to fly. The ice general is now below them on horseback looking up. She makes drogon burn the general. The results are useless. The dragon fire doesn’t work.  
 She sees jon and rheagal going down from a distance. She heads to them. 
 Winterfell our heroes are holding back the walkers . A large number die. (Jorah has just killed 2 generals) there is a break in the fighting , the living can take a breather.
 
 Jon sees the night king walking towards the area of the godswood tree  . He’s far but Jon can catch up to him. Jon charges . The night king enters the gate of the weirwood. Turns , sees Jon and raises his hands . With the raise of his hands . All the dead rise. Jon fights his way through . DAny catches up to Jon. Burns the dead , giving Jon room to enter the gate. 
 Winter fell . All the dead are rising. Winterfell is being overthrown. A giant kicks in the door.. 

   all the same things that happened in the episode inside winterfell will happen here . Lady Mormont kills the giant , Arya in the library, the hound being frozen until he sees her in trouble , Beric dying to save her . Arya meets the red witch and runs out of window .. 
 
   Jon is fighting off the dead the ice dragon shows up. Is holding Jon back with ice fire . 
 Theon dies, the ice king is face to face with bran. Jon picks removes the shield from his back holds it up to the dragon who is shooting flames . Jon is screaming in pain. He inches close swings his sword , cuts the neck of the ice dragon. The dragon now unable to shoot fire from its mouth. Jon drops the shield . Swings his sword , the dragon lets a loud scream and goes down dead. 
  The night king and bran are face to face you hear the dragon scream they both turn their head.  When he looks back to bran Arya is jumping towards him he catches her by the neck. 
 Jon staggers  into the  godswood sees the night king holding Arya by the neck . You can see the pain in his eyes as he see this . 
   Arya drops her knife , catches it in her other hand, stabs the night king in the stomach with her valerian steel dagger . The night king dies.",4,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bldfew/i_rewrote_the_battle_of_winterfell_season_8/,2019-05-06 19:17:29

363,bkupo5,"[SPOILERS] What's that? Oh, just another Azor Ahai theory.","I'm rewatching (again) and noticed that when Cersei and King Robert were having that intimate chat during the first season, Cersei mentions their son that ""died"" (which he nods- confirming that to be true). At her first mention of it to Catelyn, I thought she might have been lying to empathize with Cat, but that discussion with Robert has me believing they actually did have a child together. I have a feeling those theories that Gendry is her son are true. I also think it's Gendry who might be Azor Ahai. For one, he could forge the sword/Lightbringer as he is a smith. (""Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword."") Two, Arya was touched (pretty much choked) by the Night King and, even though she destroyed him, there's more to the story than that (I hope!)

371,bkfe9b,My GOT Ending Theory. Jon Kills Dany.,"Dany will freak out and burn Kings landing having a full blown Targaryen tantrum.  All of her recent failures have led up to this, Jorah being the cherry on top and cersi will egg her on. Jon will stop her in a scene that parallels the yiggrite execution scene. Except this time Jon kills Dany in attempt to stop her from burning everything. Yiggrite didn't deserve to die so Jon doesn't kill her. Danny will deserve it and Jon will have to stop her as required by his honor. He may even need to use Rhaegal. This could be the dance of dragons we've been waiting for. This would give Jon a purpose this season and be that bittersweet ending that George R Martin alludes to. This also aligns up with Danny's vision where she is killed by the north after failing to reach the iron throne. Since the night King is dead, Jon is the only other north that can kill her.  And when she freaks out, he will be the only one who can stop her. 

It will also allow Jon to create lightbringer which is a blade that historically was thrust through a willing lover and through living fire. This will allow him to fulfill his prophecy as azor ahai. This is how light bringer was created last time. Dany will be willing to die as azor ahai's wife was the first time because she will want Justice fufilled for her own crimes.

Also this is proven in a few other subtle ways. Ever notice how Drogon looks like the evil spawn of Satan and is red symboling destruction. And Rhaegal is green symbolizing life? Also Dany symbolizes Justice and Jon, Honor and I don't think that the two are compatible ruling together as we see in some of Danny's harsher scentences. 

 Jon also said in a recent interview that the ending isn't anything anybody could guess. Not even his wife who was part of the show. This is an ending that nobody would guess.",8,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bkfe9b/my_got_ending_theory_jon_kills_dany/,2019-05-04 04:15:35
372,bkeide,"The Long Night - What COULD have been, but never was.","I am not gonna rant about that shitty episode. There's plenty of that elsewhere. I am gonna share an alternative scenario i thought off in 1 hour, and let you compare it to the one we got.

&#x200B;

A few Dothraki are chosen and given torches, then sent against the enemy to determine the distance between themselves and the wights. Then the humans use the catapults, using projectiles with flamable material not only to kill, but also to provide some sort of light on the battlefield to counter the darkness. The area is slightly lit by moonlight, but not really enough to provide sufficient vision for the troops.

The Knight King decides to send thin waves of wights. Only human wights, not great nor low in numbers and quite spread out. The humans counter the incoming attack by forming groups and using long spears that can actually kill something at quite a distance (like the sarissa weapon, of Alexander the Great).

After realizing they are able to take on the wights, the humans are embolded and their morale is raised, so they sort of spread out of their tighly packed formations and slaying wights left and right. But regardless, the wights are numerous so John or Daenerys flies in to aid the land troops with dragon fire.

But John is worried. Something is wrong, it doesn't feel right. The Night King is nowhere to be seen, same for his dragon. So he takes off to get a look from above and figure out what's going on. He sees the White Walkers in the distance, but not the NK. And the White Walkers are sticking close to the woods. Why is that, he wonders.

As the humans are winning the fight against the wights John hears them as they begin to cheer and boast and celebrate, while at the same time he notices the Walkers giving the signal for the second phase of the assault to begin. This is the true death wave. Countless wights charging into battle, catching the troops off guard and begin to overwhelm them, slamming into their shields and weapons, piling up on them, like a tsunami smashes on the shore. The humans panick, they can't regroup, they retreat to basic instinct survival and their formations fall apart (except for the Unsullied).

They fall back within the castle, while the Dothraki provide cover. The space within Winterfell is too small for their cavalry to work effectively, so thats the only thing they can do now.

Daenerys lights up the trenches. The wight army freezes right before them. That gives the humans a time to regroup and regain their footing. Meanwhile John and Danny take the chance and begin blasting the standing wight army. So then the Night King brings forth the cold mist. This mist covers everything. It greatly reduces the area of vision for the troops, and snuffs out the trenches. The humans no longer see what's before them. John and Danny are lost within the mist so they travel upwards. They encounter the Night King there. He gives John a light smirk, before he plunges right down into the mist and gets lost again. John wants to follow him but Danny tells him its too dangerous, not only is he new to the whole dragon riding business, but he can't do anything within the mist either.

Right at that moment, the NK approaches from below like a shark (with the dragon obviously) and engages with John in dragon combat. Danny dives in as well to try and help somehow, blinded by emotion at that point.

The Night King decides to break the mist cloud, just so he can toy with John and helps him by aiding his field of vision. As the dragons go at each other, the NK's dragon manages a crucial hit on John's dragon, but John's dragon manages to shove his nails in the neck wound of the NK's dragon.

Meanwhile the dead on the ground, the giants have entered the gates. The dead that climb the walls can be held off to a certain extend but now a major strike against their defenses has been managed. The Unsullied position themselves and now they can handle the dead somewhat better now that they can't spread and circle around them. However the giants still remain. Arya takes out a few of them with the bow.

With the mist now gone, Daenerys can clearly see John, and charges on the Night King's dragon. The 2 dragons collide, and the Night King loses his grip and falls on the ground. John's dragon manages to disentangle himself but the jolt throws John off as well, who lands on top of the NK's dragon. There, he takes his chance and plunges his sword in the dragon, effectively killing it. He then begins to fall.

Johns lands on top of the now actually dead dragon, somewhat hurt, bleeding from a stab wound he got as he landed on one of the dragon's scales (or horns? whatever these things are called). Its not a lethal wound, but not easily overlooked either. He is a few meters infront in front of the gate. Behind him, he can see the wights going through the gate. Before him, he sees the White Walkers slowly approaching what is even closer to him, a rising Knight King. Before John can make a decision, Danny shows up and attempts to destroy the Night King. But from within the flames, an iced spear shoots out, and barely misses the heart of the dragon, rendering him out of commission and taking off as he whales in pain, only to crash on the other side of Winterfell.

So John is right there with the NK. The Walkers still have some way to cover. Snow pulls his sword and engages with the NK, who also pulls his weapon. But he is no match for the NK, especially with his wound. His attacks are easily parried, the NK seems to be an elegant, swift and precise fighter. He falls on the ground, and as the NK prepares for the final blow, Ghost shows up and tackles the NK, breaking his focus away from John, buying him some time to put some distance between the two. Then the NK kills Ghost. The Direwolf is now dead. The Walkers have reached NK and they all look at Snow crawling away from them while on his back. Then the NK begins to raise his arms, assuming a T-pose as he reanimates all the fallen soldiers. And just as John thinks he is doomed, his dragon appears damaged and bleeding. It's actually Bran warging in the dragon. But the dragon is heavily hurt and can't do much. So he just picks John and carries him to a relatively safe place.

373,bkai52,[Spoilers] Why isn't anyone acknowledging this?," 

I find something really unsettling about Bran. Does anyone else think he's just too powerful now that the NK is no more, to remain good? I mean isn't the show made in such a way where there's always a more powerful enemy vs the underdog. First, it was the rich, powerful Robert+Lannister vs Danny. Then it turned into living vs dead. And now since the dead are defeated, what's the relevance of 3ER? What are his motives? Don't you think if he is really on their side, winning the throne would be kinda easy for them?  
Also what is that Tyrion is aware of? I ask this question cuz of the following reason:

1. What talk did he had with Cersei? Is Cersei really breaking her word, or ""My armies will march to North alongside you in the great war"" mean that this wasn't really the great war.
2. I found it really intriguing the way Tyrion asked Bran to tell his story. I mean of all the people, why Bran? Why not Arya? What is that he needed to confirm?
3. Also, I found it interesting the way Tyrion said that he thinks they might win the war against the dead, he's definitely not stupid to be saying things for no reason. What's more interesting was the way Bran does not think that they'll survive.

386,bjyem5,So What Can We Guess About The Rest of GoT?,"\[Spoilers\]

Start with the obvious... HBO would never deny us the long awaited fight between the Hound and his brother the (zombie) Mountain no matter how Ramsay (i.e. tormenting) they go on us. Beware of fire, Mr. Hound...

Based on episode 803, we can be pretty sure that any major character who dies in upcoming episodes will have a death scene to remember ... but no final words. 

Can't believe we won't have a reunion of the surviving direwolves... question: who do Nymeria and Ghost have a grudge against (that's still alive)?... Bolton is dead (Shaggydog), the Night King is Dead (Summer), Frey is dead (Grey Wind)... that only leaves Lady, killed at the orders of Cersei.  

My thoughts are that the whole incest thing between Jon and Dany has been overplayed... the Targaryens actually have a dispensation to marry their kin from the Citadel... Dany may be glad to have a family member again... she grew up expecting to marry her brother Viserys (shudder...)

Jaime is fated to die with his sister... does he kill her and why? Perhaps she kills Brienne? 

Brienne and Tormand will have (at least) a moment before it's all over... he's the only man who's ever wanted her as a woman... and - on the eve of battle - why not? In the scene around the Winterfell fireplace, she is definitely weakening...

If Jon and Dany don't survive to mount the Iron Throne, my candidates are a reunited Sansa and Tyrion, who are each, in their own words, ""the smartest person I've ever known.""",2,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bjyem5/so_what_can_we_guess_about_the_rest_of_got/,2019-05-02 22:33:21

If you look at the timeline between the war of the first men and the first long night, there's over 2000 years spanning between them. That means that for over 2000 years the COTF lived peacefully with the White Walkers. But something changed, maybe the NK (Like Satan) realized his power and led a revolt of White Walkers and Wights against the COTF, eventually losing and being cast out.

396,bjr1rs,"[Spoilers] A call back from Season 2, ""The North Remembers","I am re-watching the series, as one does, and of course seeing things in a new light. An interesting scene happens between Robb and Jaime in S2Ep1, ""The North Remembers"".

Robb visits Jaime in the cage where he is imprisoned. Likely due to boredom, and perhaps a measure of cruelty, Jaime taunts Robb for being a boy, insinuating that Robb prefers boys. Robb  responds by saying that Jaime insults himself because he was beaten by a boy, is imprisoned by a boy, and might one day be killed by a boy. 

It's this last line that got my attention, given how many call backs we've seen this season, so much symmetry and so much of what turns out to be foreshadowing in the earlier seasons. 

It could easily be nothing, but it could also be something. And the interesting thing is that at that moment in the series, Arya was impersonating a boy for her own survival. Another person here earlier put forward one potential scenario, where Arya kills Jaime, and uses his face to assassinate Cersei. This would certainly fit with that scenario.

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zMPuo6KF5Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zMPuo6KF5Y) 

Of course, this is just idle speculation on my part, I would not put money on this happening, but it certainly is interesting to think about. Other ""boys"" would of course be Gendry, and Pod..

411,bj8amb,[SPOILERS S08E03] Daenerys third betrayal theory.,"***SPOILERS S08E03***

Okay so here is _my theory_ that I think is VERY POSSIBLE after watching the last episode (The Long Night)

According to the prophecy Daenerys will be betrayed once more and this time she will be betrayed for love.
Now, pay close attention to Tyrion and Sansa's [conversation in the crypt](https://youtu.be/DKy7VvR0Xkg).
Tyrion says they maybe should have stayed married and Sansa tells him it wouldn't work between them BECAUSE of his allegiance to Daenerys. Like that is the only reason why it wouldn't work!

_So I think that Tyrion will betray Daenerys (which is very possible at this point) and he will betray her because of his love for Sansa._

*What supports this theory?*
- Sansa telling Tyrion ""you were the best of them""
- they had 4 scenes together in this season 2 times their marriage came up
- Sansa mentions Tyrion and defends him before Daenerys
- the way they looked at each other when they thought they are going to die in the crypt
- Sansa says they wouldn't work while he serves ""the dragon queen"" and that it would ""create problems""

416,bj9rep,The Long Night/The Night King Episode Plan (What I wish had happened) [Spoilers s8e3),"So, I'm a fan of the show but was disappointed with most of season 7 and what we've seen of 8. Was massively disappointed by The Long Night. 

Here's how I wish it had gone down. Just an outline I got excited about and couldn't help but put down. I think this takes what's good about what we saw, gives the battle more weight, resolves and explains the Night King and is just the kind of thing Game of Thrones could be doing now. A lot of it came from how much I enjoyed Isaac Hempstead Wright's performances as the Three Eyed Raven and the potential there. I haven't thought about anything happening elsewhere. I've incorporated a couple of widely known theories I particularly like. If you're avoiding that kind of stuff then don't read. 

As a forewarning, I haven't read the books and my knowledge of the lore may have bigger holes than I realise. This is just what I would have liked...

The Long Night

Battle as is, I guess (don’t want to get into strategies to improve on the (terrible) ones used in the show), except Daenerys is safe and weeping over Jorah atop her dragon looking for Jon. Viserion was killed in the skies. Jon does not get near the Night King. The battle is lost, almost everyone is dead or fleeing. Jon and Arya are somewhere within the castle grounds. The dead are static awaiting the meeting between the Night King and the Three Eyed Raven.

Brienne, Beric, Pod, Sam, Davos & Greyworm (delete as necessary for whoever needs to be left) have all been killed. Lyanna was crushed underfoot by the giant. At some point, Arya stalks and defeats a Wight managing to totally incapacitate it and goes to destroy it (‘I should see...what it’s like’) but hesitates. Brienne has assigned Jaime to protect Sansa in the crypt, saying she didn’t want him to die fighting with his left hand on the battlefield and that he deserved the chance to show his honour and quality. He’s not too happy about it. He is treated with distrust by the woman and children and speaks to Tyrion and Varys; ‘who can blame them? At the hour of their death they are in the company of not one but two Lannisters. The great tombs of their house protected by the Kingslayer, no less’. But Jaime prevails when the tombs break open, saving Sansa and most of the women and children. At one point, nearly overcome, he is saved by Tyrion who fights with his dragonglass dagger. Both become heroes; ‘The North remembers, Ser Jaime Lannister of the Long Night’.

In the courtyard, one Wight steals a sidelong glance at Theon’s corpse. The Night King approaches Bran/the Three Eyed Raven. They exchange a long look before the Night King bows his head and bends the knee.

CREDITS. BOOM!

The Night King

Scan over the carnage of The Battle of the Long Night. Jaime, Sansa and Tyrion are listening, petrified, to the sudden silence. Brienne, Beric, Pod, Sam, Davos & Greyworm (as before) are all shown reanimated in the dead army. In the courtyard, we notice our Wight from before as the Night King kneels at Bran’s feet. Bran places his hand onto the Night King’s head and briefly wargs into him. The Night King stands, raises his hand and the entire army begins to move. We are shown the entire army converging on Jon, who can only hear them from his position, and can sense that the Three Eyed Raven/Bran has passed on the information. Suddenly, amongst the exodus of the courtyard, the Wight we noticed breaks ranks and bursts towards the Night King. A movement across her face and it is Arya leaping to him from behind, grabbed by the throat and performing the knife drop kill. The army of the dead instantly shatter and Jon hears them disappear beyond the last door keeping them from him. The Night King collapses to the ground (but does not shatter). Arya looks to Bran like ‘You what mate?’

Now an exposition dump, partly narrated by Bran/The Three Eyed Raven. A section of this, ideally 20 minutes or so, would have opened the episode so Arya’s kill wouldn’t be right at the start. We go back to when Bran was learning about warging, greenseeing and his family’s history. Max von Sydown (the then current ‘host’ of the 3ER spirit) is shown to be manipulating Bran into believing that, perhaps, with his uniquely attuned abilities, he might be able to influence the past. We sense there is some personal goal being expressed in this. tAt first, he convinces Bran the best way to prevent the war is to intervene and help the people before his time defeat the Wights before they even came back into Westeros, We are shown how the first attempt results in Aery’s Targaryan becoming the Mad King. Bran is terrified of this happening again so the 3ER convinces him to intervene in the creation of the Night King. They observe the man who the Children of Men are soon to capture and turn into the Night King. The 3ER convinces Bran to warg into him to prevent him being captured. At a crucial moment, the 3ER bails on the vision/greenseeing sesh and Bran’s mind is left inside the man’s body, in his panic, is found/comes across/is captured even earlier and Bran suffers the horrible fate of becoming the Night King; a soldier controlled by the Children of the Forest. 

We are shown the 3ER waking in the tree alongside Bran’s (mindless) body. The 3ER slits the throat of the Three Eyed Crow form (MVSydow) and awakens in Bran. He has a plan. 

We are shown Bran, as the Night King and not really in any sort of control, fighting the war for the Children and doing whatever he did in that time. He then wanders the wilderness North of the Wall without purpose, with Bran’s mind slowly rotting and warping over the thousand years.

The 3ER explains to Arya (monologuing, yes but with flashbacks and stuff so it’s okay) was never just one man, but an ancient spirit that was tasked, in some abstract sense (I’m sure there’s canon stuff out there) with observing everything. Perhaps one of the Gods, even it doesn’t know anymore. It has been around since whatever you call the oldest times in Game of Thrones. And that, over the course of endless time, it has grown tired of watching history repeating itself and being forced to bear witness to the nonsense of life. But as life continues, the 3ER must persist, transferring forever from one body to the next. So, his plan was to greensee back into moments of the Night King/Bran’s years in the wilderness, planting seeds in the fragile mind, ideas about returning to The Three Eyed Raven to be reunited with his body. (‘It must have been so hard for him, mad as he was. All that waiting. And for what? A crippled corpse, just decades from death’). He ‘convinces’ the Night King to gather an army and bring the Long Night to Westeros. The 3ER longs for a dead world, with no living creatures whatsoever for it to be forced into. He knows the living cannot survive, has always been hopeless and has orchestrated the situation so as many key players are at Winterfell for the slaughter. He will wait for the Night King to finish the job in the South, kill him, destroying the dead army, and then destroy Bran Stark’s body and, he hopes, be free.

Arya’s all like….are you shitting me, son? She realises how Bran must have suffered, and how she just finally destroyed his mind within the Night King. (We also revisit how ‘Bran’s’ ‘accidental’ warping of Hodor’s mind, I’m hoping that would hold up to scrutiny). Jon arrives. In this moment of tragedy of her and celebration we see the 3ER warging...oh Shit! The Night King is standing up, all warged out and is coming at Jon, sword raised. In a brief but excellent battle Jon decapitates the Night King with his special, legendary (right?) sword. This time, he shatters. (In defeat, passively of course,3ER: ‘The prophecy is fulfilled after all. The Prince Who Was Promised’ Arya approaches, ‘I so long to die. But I know, as do you, that I’ll come back. I’ll always come back.’ Arya slits his throat and Bran is entirely gone from the world.",0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bj9rep/the_long_nightthe_night_king_episode_plan_what_i/,2019-05-01 02:38:55

But are we seriously questioning Arya’s ability to sneak up and kill the NK

If there is anyone in the show that can do this, who else would it be?

She literally has been through so much all by herself.

She clearly left the castle to plan something. In the past too she manages to defeat her opponents with an element of surprise. 

No one can kill the NK

Arya is No one.

437,biv2wj,Bran should have been Professor X,"For me, Arya’s scene with the NK was quite epic and satisfying. Not what we expected, but she finished gloriously her character arc. 

The problem was that the Battle of Winterfell lost it’s purpose after the NK died and we realized Bran did exactly what he has been doing since the show began: NOTHING!

Since the beginning of the show we have been exposed to the idea that Bran would play an crucial role on the Great War. However, even when he warged out of the Godswood, he did nothing, provided no information whatsoever and didn’t help characters in desperate needs, such as Jon and Daenerys. 

What I think should have happened was a Professor X type of scene, where he fought Apocalypse in an epic mind battle. Maybe he could recreate a scenerio for their battle such as the Trident, Castle Black or an empty Winterfell. He could finally “fly”, as promised. 

Unfortunately, we will never get to see what Bran’s powers would look like against this amazing vilain.",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/biv2wj/bran_should_have_been_professor_x/,2019-04-30 01:34:36

Thanks to the suggestion from one of my listeners, I went to a bingo generator website, entered all the names of all the living characters I could think of, and it spit out 30 randomized bingo cards for me.

&#x200B;

I've uploaded them to my website, which can be found here:

I'm going to hand these out to my friends this week, and I figure we'll use ink to mark the deaths, since it's unlikely that anyone will get a bingo THIS week.  Maybe.

But we also had to listen to her tell Sam she murdered his father and brother, (I know the dad wasn’t an awesome person but his brother was cool) simply for not bending the knee. He didn’t react in anger, he didnt want to put her on trial for it. And just like Jamie she would never apologize for it. I find this sort of hypocritical.

490,bh9l6y,[THEORY] What the Night king wants and how both man and the dead win.,"We all know from one side of the coin what the Night king is after now, I don't know why more people aren't talking about this, Bran said it himself, Bran’s death is the goal, Bran revealed this to the major characters in the show in Ep.2, maybe not all of it but what's relevant to the people present at winterfell. He wants Bran because Bran is what holds the memory of mankind and the NK was made specifically to end mankind, as long as the Raven exists the memories will too, hence I feel like Bran actually dies, but since he's going to be near a weirwood tree he transfers the powers to someone else, my guess is Sam. Hear me out here, I base this on two things, 
a) Sam has been learning about history and has a keen interest in it and would make the perfect Raven, if you remember, Bran was sort of a substitute and was made one in a hurry, also Sam is going to be within winterfell during the Battle.
b) Sam is the one telling us this story of the Game, Sam is claimed to be the incarnation of GRRM in the story. Hence he is the reason we all get to know what happened in the story. 

What the Night king wants to do and actually does is the other side of the coin and still unknown. What I'm guessing will happen is that Bran will know and begin the transfer while letting himself be killed somewhere away from Sam, the NK must think he has achieved his goal without knowing about Sam and retreats to satisfy another motive or to gather his strength.
Bran’s words hold true because there was no reason for the NK to mark him otherwise. Despite all the memes and jokes on Bran I believe he's one of the most pivotal characters in the story, because Bran’s sacrifice is the greatest, he knows he's marked so mankind will never be safe, he also holds a great power and has his duty to protect all that makes the present and shape the future. The power has to go to someone else, it's Sam and since Ravens can live for a long time, years later it's Sam telling us this story through his perspective.",13,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bh9l6y/theory_what_the_night_king_wants_and_how_both_man/,2019-04-25 18:55:54

492,bh8c2d,HBO NOW - how do I stop GoT recaps from airing after episode?,"I'm watching old seasons of GoT on my laptop (Chrome) and the HBO NOW website is extremely annoying for 3 reasons: 

1 - Recap autoplay at the end of every episode. When I drag to the end to skip it, instead of autoplaying the next episode it takes me to the beginning of the recap. 

2 - The options for viewing next at the bottom are all recaps/extras. None are a direct link to the next episode. 

3 - Clicking anywhere near the bottom of the screen when viewing full screen (even sometimes not full screen) takes me to the episode recap. So if I accidentally miss hitting the pause / rewind 10s button it automatically takes me to recap, after which, I have to go to Series > GoT > season > episode to get back to where I was. Mega annoying.
