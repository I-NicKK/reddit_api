31,bu1p8c,[SPOILERS] Dear Everyone Who Hated the Game of Thrones Finale,"I didn’t hate the ending to Game of Thrones. I didn’t love how everything happened. But I don’t disagree with the outcome.

Let me start by saying the show WAS rushed. This could’ve been seasons longer — not just episodes longer. Some things remain unclear. For that, I too have frustrations. It definitely wasn’t perfect (see: Starbucks cup and water bottle). Most fans’ pain points are focused on the fact that things weren’t “explained.” I can see that. But I’m also the psycho who kind of likes the fact that things weren’t spelled out perfectly. Some things were open to our own interpretation.

Since Sunday night, I’ve seen angry texts, tweets and posts questioning things that happened (or didn’t happen)—including questions that I thought there were clear answers to. So, right or wrong, I wanted to give some insight from someone who didn’t absolutely hate the ending.

&#x200B;

**“Dany fought for 8 seasons and became one of our favorite characters for absolutely nothing.”**   
No. Dany fought for 8 seasons to get to where she is today so that we could fall in love with her character. Just like Jon fell in love with her. The writers wanted us to respect all the good she has done in this world. They wanted us to WANT her on the throne — so that we could feel as much emotion as we did when she died. We were supposed to be just as torn as Jon was.

&#x200B;

**“Why would there be a Night’s Watch if the white walkers are gone?”**   
There isn’t. The show ended with all of the wildlings leaving the wall behind them. Jon is king of the free folk. Brandon put him in the “true north” where he belongs.

&#x200B;

**“Jon being a Targaryen doesn’t matter.”**   
A). In a show where power and family names rule all of Westeros, Jon didn’t want it. He never wanted any of it. The one true heir to the iron throne was the very person who wanted it least. That’s essentially what the entire show is about. He had to secretly be someone with power to make that message clear to viewers.   


B). Dany finding out Jon was Targaryen was the tipping point in going mad. She realized she could never be loved as a leader like he is… even though he pledged his allegiance.

&#x200B;

**“What happened to the prophecy?!”** 

Azor Ahai killed his love to save the world. Jon was brought back to life to kill Dany, the woman he loved, to save the entire world from destruction.

&#x200B;

**“So there were no green eyes?”** 

Little Finger had green eyes. For people complaining that Arya didn’t kill Cersei, I don’t think there’s anything more cliche than her saying for 6 seasons she’s going to kill the queen… and having it play out perfectly. I’ll take realistic over predictable.

&#x200B;

**“Bran said: I’m the three-eyed raven now. I can’t be Lord of Winterfell. Now he’s suddenly saying: What do you think I came all the way here for?”**   
Bran says this when the entire world is against them. He says this before they wiped out the entire army of the dead and before they took down Cersei and King’s Landing. Obviously a LOT has changed since then. Just because he says “what do you think I came all the way here for” also does not mean he necessarily “wants” it. He is saying he understands that this is his purpose, and he’s ready to fill it.

&#x200B;

**“Tyrion is a literal prisoner. How is he determining the fate of who rules?”**   
As a side note, I hated this little circle pow-wow they all had. Not who they chose, but HOW they chose could’ve been better. BUT. There is not currently a ruler or anyone in power because the queen died. Tyrion was the hand of the queen. He has power by default and the least people can do is listen.

&#x200B;

**“How does Bran have the best story out of everyone?!”**   
I don’t think this is meant to be taken so literally. Bran is the world’s memory. He represents all people in the realm. He has the best story because he has ALL the stories.

&#x200B;

**“How do you pick Brandon Stark — someone who sat there doing absolutely nothing all series — for the throne.”** 

And here is my aha moment: I think this is literally the point of the entire show.

Since the beginning we are conditioned to believe that it’s about the lengths people will go to sit on the iron throne. But over the course of 8 seasons, we see what power, greed and selfishness can do in the hands of the wrong people. Even some of our favorite characters. Because of this, we slowly start learning that the throne is not actually all it’s cracked up to be. In fact, the throne itself is the problem. Hence Drogon burning it. We also learn that maybe the best rulers are the ones who don’t want to rule. And this journey of what we thought was always a quest for power, suddenly becomes far more than that: it becomes a search for purpose. This turn of events is called irony. And the show has ALWAYS been about irony.

**An unwanted bastard being the true heir to the iron throne.**  
**A rejected imp becoming hand of the queen.**   
**Dany becoming the father she swore she’d never become.**   
**Cersei’s precious “red keep that has never fallen” being what crumbles and kills her.**   
**Arya, who has assumed other identities all her life, sailing away under a huge Stark banner.**   
**Bran, the one person to never care about greed, power or ruling, being the ONE person to have it all in the end.**  
 **A show about the importance of a throne actually being about its undeniable pitfalls.**

Call me crazy. But to me, there’s nothing more fitting than this ending.

Sure, the predictable, happy-go-lucky, Jon-and-Dany-rule-together sounds great. But that’s NOT Game of Thrones. It’s never been. And don’t get me wrong—all of our fan theories are more than entertaining. But just because they didn’t happen, doesn’t give the show any less of an awe factor.

“The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.” That’s what it’s always been about: the Starks.

Was it perfect? Not in the slightest. Could they have done more? Yes. Do I think there were things left unexplained? Of course. But I think it’s so impressive what they’ve done with this story since the beginning. A character I would go to war for might be someone you would kill. The ending I’ve been pulling for might be the opposite of what you hoped to see. The writers allowed us to connect with different characters, feel different emotions, want different things… all from the same show. Regardless of what we agree and disagree on… This has been so fun to follow for the past 8 seasons.

I hope fans can eventually get the bad taste of this last season out of their mouths. I also hope fans find what they’re looking for in GRRM’s book, which we now know will be slightly different than the show. But despite its imperfections, I’ll be appreciating everything Game of Thrones has given us in the meantime: one hell of a good story.

32,blquyt,>!Spoilers!< Poor explanation as to why Gendry called himself ‘Gendry Rivers’ and not ‘Waters.’,"So as you may know in the show there’s a bit of a plot hole. Gendry, upon being legitimized, goes to Arya and tells her that he is no longer Gendry Rivers, but Gendry Baratheon. Many are confused and angry because he was born in the crown lands and should have the surname ‘Waters’. However it is Westerosi custom that bastards of noble lords are named after where they are raised and not where they are born. ( Jon Snow) Furthermore, Gendry was never even recognized by Robert Baratheon, so he would not be given a surname.

However we see Gendry leave King’s Landing in season 1 to join the Night’s Watch. They make their journey North, but after Yoren and the others being killed, Gendry, Arya, and Hot-pie travel around the Riverlands. They are held prisoner in Harrenhaal by the Lannisters and they have a brief run-in with the Brotherhood. This is a big adventure for just a group of teenagers. (Keep note of that) 

Eventually Gendry is taken by Melissandre, finds out about his father and him being a bastard. Eventually Ser Davos frees him from Dragonstone and tells him to hide from the Lannisters. 

Gendry’s plan is to hide right under the nose of the Lannisters. Now that he’s on his own he would likely want a name for himself. However, by saying his name was Gendry Waters, this would be a little suspicious as all the bastards of Robert were hunted down. So he may have chosen the surname Rivers for 2 reasons. 1: To throw off the Lannisters by making them think he’s a bastard raised in the Riverlands. 2: Because the adventures he undertook with Arya and Hot-pie and the Brotherhood were defining moments in his life, and matured him into being a man. So perhaps he feels he was truly given a sense of belonging in the Riverlands, and this gave himself the name Gendry Rivers.

Anyways that’s my thoughts on the matter. I’m not saying that it was or wasn’t a mistake in the show, but i think these explanations do justify it a bit.",51,280,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/blquyt/spoilers_poor_explanation_as_to_why_gendry_called/,2019-05-07 17:42:53

43,bny23x,"[SPOILERS] I don't hate the most hated female characters, I feel sorry for them.","Half-expecting some downvotes for this post, but I wanted to get this off my chest because it's been bothering me more than it should. After browsing the reddit, I can see that Cersei and Daenerys are some of the most hated female characters in the show that a lot of fans want dead. People definitely have some valid reasons for hating them. While it's true Cersei has done way more harm than good, I don't envy the life that she's had. I know, I know: ""She is the cause of most of her own suffering, she never learns and she deserves to rot!"" But that's exactly *why* I feel sorry for her. Same goes for Daenerys. Let's do a quick side-by-side comparison of the tragic upbringings both these women had.

Cersei:

* her mother dies giving birth to her dwarf brother
* craves her father's approval but he neglects her emotionally
* father psychologically abuses her simply for being born a woman as he believes women are weaker than men
* father's more preoccupied with getting/keeping the throne and having the most power than caring for and loving his children
* father forces her to marry Robert Baratheon for a foothold on the iron throne
* develops alcoholism to cope with abuse
* craves love so badly she allows unhealthy incestuous relationship with her twin brother
* grows up to adopt the same values that were important to her father which is iron throne > family/love
* grows up to be ""cold"", aloof, selfish, generally incapable of displaying warmth and affection, and unable to learn from past mistakes

Daenerys:

* both parents dead by the time she's born
* raised poor and alone by her brother because the rest of her family is dead
* brother is obsessed with vengeance plot to take back the iron throne and have the Lannisters & Baratheons executed for committing treason against the Targaryens
* brother emotionally abuses her by treating her like a piece of property instead of like family
* brother sexually harasses her
* brother forces her at 13 years of age to wed Khal Drogo so that he can have Dothraki army to help him get back the iron throne
* gets raped by Khal on wedding night
* brother emotionally abuses her into submitting to his will
* finally rages and has her only living sibling killed
* grows up to adopt the same values that were important to her brother which is iron throne > family/love
* grows up to be ""cold"", aloof, has entitlement issues, has abandonment issues due to most of her lineage being dead, has delusional messiah complex, and intense rage triggers

That's when fans try to compare Cersei and Dany to Sansa and Arya. They say ""That's no excuse! Look at Sansa and Arya. They've been through hell and back and they're still stable, grounded women!"" OK, but both Sansa and Arya came from loving families and loving homes. Their parents loved them dearly and instilled wholesome family-oriented values in them. They taught their children that love and family come first. That's also why Bran and Jon turned out so great. Sansa and Arya survived the horrific abuse they faced because no matter how bad things got, the love they received in childhood and the values they were taught kept them from falling to pieces. If Sansa and Arya had the dysfunctional upbringings that Cersei and Dany had, this would be a much different and much darker story. All of Cersei and Dany's behavioral issues are the result of the kind of environment they were raised in. So I don't hate Cersei and Dany. I hate the environment that molded them and other abused women like them.

Edit: It just irritates me to see in the GoT communities that Sansa and Arya are ""better women"" than Cersei and Dany because they made better choices. But with the sort of tragic upbringings Cersei and Dany had, how can anyone expect them to make better choices than the ones who came from good upbringings with loving families? These women were doomed from the moment that they started being abused as children. Dany tried to learn from her abusive past and make better choices for a little while, but once everyone she cared about is killed and the majority of people she trusted in betrayed her, these things kept piling on one after another until she has a complete mental breakdown. Now she believes that humanity has always been inherently evil (thanks to all the abuse she endured since childhood) and that humanity must burn. If that doesn't create the feeling of sorrow and compassion caused by suffering and the misfortunes of others, then I don't know what does.",16,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bny23x/spoilers_i_dont_hate_the_most_hated_female/,2019-05-13 07:12:37

46,bdc67f,GoT ENDING Theory," 

At the end, Jon will come to face-to-face with the White Walker Dragon. The Undead Dragon will spit its ice-fire at Jon, but because he is both Targaryen and Stark, he will be able to survive the flame. This will reveal Jon as the ""Prince Who Was Promised"" to everyone, including the Night King. Realizing this, the Night King plunges a dragonglass knife into Jon's heart to make him the new Night King, just like he was made by the Children of the Forest and finally allowing the old one to rest. Everyone always talks about how Jon took a knife in the heart to save everyone. ""He died for us."" This time, he will take a knife to the heart to be the new leader of the White Walkers and save the whole world. However, resulting in opposite implications from before. Instead of dying, he will live forever: Fire and Ice.

After his transition, he will say goodbye to Daenerys which will be heartbreaking. He will the ride the Ice Dragon north, leading the white walkers safely away from everyone, and fly to the cave where he and Ygritte should have never left. He will live there until the end of time, keeping his new love safe and spending an eternity at the site of his happiest memory from his first love. He will control the Undead and keep them away from the living forever. He first died to save his people, and now he will live an eternity alone to save everyone: Fire and Ice. Which, in my opinion, is far worse. The ""Prince Who Was Promised,"" is not for the 7 Kingdoms, and Jon never cared about having a title, just fulfilling his duties. It will end with him as the Master of the Dead, unable to bring back the one person he wants from it.

**Clears throat.**

So VT posted [this](http://vt.co/entertainment/film-tv/fans-have-come-to-the-conclusion-that-game-of-thrones-season-eight-sucks/?utm_source=vt&utm_medium=junglecreations&utm_campaign=post&fbclid=IwAR39tfvEvaQACKs-f_vRsZhFe1TOxTUZTvUO9reNDYWH000OfoGEIIOZAyU)...

And I have a lot of comments to these ""fans"", but remembered [what Kit said](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27129141/kit-harington-game-of-thrones-critics-fans/?fbclid=IwAR2yybm-RAcDSsQ2M1GuBS857KXkkAQKF5rwlTljkC8VihXAyOm1hj6uqGs) before S08 started airing.

**So yeah, FUCK the critics or these ""fans""**. I love this show from the very beginning, and there is something in GoT that you can't din in any other movie, tv show, or book. The characters and story, the world building, lore, and more.

She literally has been through so much all by herself.

She clearly left the castle to plan something. In the past too she manages to defeat her opponents with an element of surprise. 

No one can kill the NK

Arya is No one.

It doesn't matter if you're pointing out a difference between the show and the books that you don't think affect the show-watching experience. Someone who uses this sub should be able to go from watching the show to later reading the books, and be completely surprised by all these differences.

That's actually one of the rationales for the zero-tolerance policy on book content: if someone from this sub wants to read the books after watching the show, the differences should all be new to them.

The MAIN reason for the zero-tolerance policy is that elements of the books can be worked into the show out of chronological order, and used in a completely different context. So if you say, ""hey So-and-so was only such-and-such in the books but that's not in the show"" you not only are spoiling the books for people who plan to read them, you might be spoiling future episodes of the show.

121,bqse35,[SPOILERS] Here's what I didn't like about the finale,"1. Daenerys' justification for mass slaughter is vague at best. She believes she freed a generation from tyranny by murdering them. She seems rather cogent, and I'm not going to believe that she is now downright delusional and crazy after barely two episodes of set up.

2. Why is Jon trying to defend Daenerys' actions against  Tyrion's condemnations? I get he's conflicted, but Jon doesn't seem like the type of guy who needs a motivational pep talk from Tyrion to help him see that what Daenerys did was morally insane.

3. The dragon had an intuition that the throne symbolized possessive political power, and that that was truly the thing that killed his mother. I understand the poetic meaning behind it but, like the horse at the end on E5, it just doesn't fit well.

4. Where is that white horse anyways? Arya is still around. Did she literally just use that horse for a two minute ride and then shooed it away once she left the city?

5. There was a weird time gap between Daenerys' death and Greyworm's consultation with the Westerosi lords. It was a bit jarring.

6. Selecting a king was mentioned off-hand in conversation and it literally takes ten minutes for everyone to unanimously come to a decisions based off of a one-minute inspirational talk from Tyrion.

7. Why are the lords bargaining with Greyworm in the first place? Why don't they just forcefully take Jon. They could easily overwhelm him. What power does Greyworm have over them?

8. Greyworm is evil. 

9. None of Jon's siblings mention that their brother is the true heir? Wouldn't this help rally support for Jon's freedom?

10. The Jon and Dany pregnancy side story was completely forgotten.

11. Jon's parentage didn't do much else than establish drama between him and Dany. His parents were just used as a mechanism for Dany to be pissed off at him. Beyond that, Jon's parents aren't significant narrative-wise.

12. Jon ends up reverting back to his season 1 self--damned to the Night's Watch.

13. Why is there a Night's Watch after the dead are gone and the Wildlings are no longer a threat?

14. Arya is a pirate.

15. Bran knew thousands of innocents would die but I guess he couldn't do anything because fate or something.

16. How does Bran being ""the memory of everything"" make him a qualified candidate for being king? Okay, sure, he doesn't ""want"" the throne which makes him less power hungry--but is that a strong enough determinant for being a good king? 

17. It felt way too rushed.

18. All of this happening three episodes after the Night King is killed just feels off. The Night King was treated as some side plot that needed to be disposed of.

19. Bronn serves on the small council.

20. Arya never used her face power at all this season.

21. Jon and Tyrion didn't do much this season.

22. This was the final episode of a fantastic show. It felt rushed, shallow, and inconclusive.",31,79,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bqse35/spoilers_heres_what_i_didnt_like_about_the_finale/,2019-05-20 11:24:03

124,bdqk7u,Just another end game speculation...,"Obviously what I am about to write is for the most part, if not all, are shotgunned all over the internet. You've been warned...

Lets talk about that first episode!

After anxiously shitting myself and impatiently waiting 2 years for this premiere, I was crawling out of my skin with excitement. I absorbed every morsel of that sweet experience. ''Winterfell'' was the set up of chess pieces being placed exactly where they should be. 

&#x200B;

''Everything you did, brought you to where you are now.''   -Bran Stark, The Three-Eyed Raven.

&#x200B;

This episode definitely emphasized ''The beginning of the end'' for me. I couldn't help but feel peaceful and comfortable and at home with everyone literally underneath the same roof. The last Hoo-Rah of the shows very existence. Season 1 throwbacks for days, which also made everything feel full circle. Although I enjoyed experiencing these moments with these characters, In my head, winter will fall, and all I could feel was absolute dread. But don't get me wrong, it made this episode more beautiful. Because what is life without death? the whole reason why life is so beautiful is because it does not last forever.

&#x200B;

 So now that my soul is literally drowning the page, lets talk character arcs and possible conclusions.

Lets start with Jon and his reaction to something that I felt, was handled consistently well. Jon Snow now knows something, and I think he will deal and react to this later in this season the way that I think he SHOULD handle it. Rhaegar isn't his father, Ned is. Jon wouldn't be who he is today if it wasn't for Ned Stark. Jon is Ned, so are the rest of the Starks. A piece of him resides in the Wolf pack. Even Theon Greyjoy. 

I don't believe Jon will turn away from who he is just because his parents were Lyanna and Rhaegar. I believe that everything in this show is closely interwoven, with a keen detail of subtle foreshadowing.

&#x200B;

''Let me give you some advice bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.'' -Tyrion Lannister

&#x200B;

I believe this will also come full circle in the end. Everybody is where they are for a reason. The show has been making that very clear. No, he is Jon Snow, the Bastard of Winterfell. It was who he was before he got where he is, and will honor who he is. It will spark a realization and a more divine purpose inside of him, hence the reason why Bran insists on him knowing. So one of the final pieces are put in its rightful place. So basically what I'm saying is that he isn't going to be drawn in with the temptation of that title and will stay true to himself. But if he were to survive and it was offered to him, he would either refuse or take it up and maintain it in the best way possible. Jon lived life as a bastard, no titles, no mother, and alone. It was a very humbling road of discipline and self discovery by starting from the very bottom, without a single clue on where hes going or how hes going to get there. Its why people followed him, and called him their King. Its why Daenerys fell in love with him. This is the true potential that can be unlocked through pain, loss, sacrifice, heartbreak, honor, discipline, loneliness which incites self discovery. All of which a true king should possess.

&#x200B;

If I were to speculate Jon's conclusion, I would have to say that there will come a moment where he will either have to sacrifice his soul, or sacrifice his life for the greater cause. I mean, someones got to die! I hate to say it but its the central focal point of G.R.R.M's mantra. Don't be afraid to kill your characters. Not to mention the word down the grapevine was that the ending will be bittersweet, which lines up. If both Jon and Daenerys lives before the credits roll for this show, it won't be a completely justified ending to this story. The reason why I am not pointing fingers at the rest of the main cast is because lets face it. At this point the MAIN characters of this story is the Song of Fire and Ice. With an obvious important Bran and Night King vibe.

UNFORTUNATELY, the other main characters for the most part will bite the dust and it will be absolutely tragic. But the ending of this show in my opinion rests on the shoulders of the the mystery behind the Night King and his purpose. Bran's purpose, and the character arcs of both Jon and Daenerys - having to face themselves and try and deal with these important, moving forward decisions.

Daenerys will have to face the upcoming news of Jon's new found discovery, while at the same time having to deal with a skeptical north folk and the Stark family. She doesn't realize this but she is becoming power hungry in her own way and its slowly boiling over. She will burn people alive who won't bend the knee. If Sam's sad face was any indication. She is impulsive, but yet still cognitive of her family history. I just hope that she doesn't lose herself into an idea that's been enticed by Olenna Tyrell's ''Be a Dragon'' pep talk. (More subtle foreshadowing, which will serve as another check mark into her developing character arc). Its hard to say what will happen. But if I were a betting man, I think she will make the right decision, because it's fan service that needs to happen. The show seems to be building towards the end where the gravity of the 'bittersweet' concept rests mostly on important character deaths. Jon and Dany will take the right path that would satisfy fans and wrap up their entire character arc, that's the sweet part. But the bitter, will be who dies, how they die, and the conclusion of Bran Stark. 

Bran is only half a man, who sees things from our perspective. He is marked for a reason. And again, if I were a betting man. I believe Bran is who the Night King desires the most. Everything was set in motion from moment Bran was pushed out of the window. He was meant to be where he is right now just like everyone else and he is the reason why the Night King is on his way south of the wall. Magics were carved in its very foundations. The Night King and the Three-Eyed Raven share the same power, a bond. The symbols weren't originated by the White Walkers, but from the Children of the Forest. The Children of the Forest have accidentally created a prophecy like string of events, in order to defeat their enemy. In doing so, they've created a situation where in order to maintain balance of the Weirwood, there must always be a Night King, and there must always be a Three Eyed-Raven to be trained in order to become the new Night King.

If anybody is familiar with Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time, it kinda as its similar full circle, repeatable prophetic nature to it. Bran isn't the Night King, he is destined to become the next Night King. Hes a stark, and has the blood of the FIRST MEN, which was exactly who the Night King was. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell (Where Winter Fell). There is a significant meaning to all of this obviously...All of these side prophesies like the witch who told Cersei of her fate. The reason why the witch said that she won't like the answers to her questions is because one you are gifted with the answers, you are from there on cursed with the knowledge which ends up coming true. It sounds on the nose when I put it that way but being raised in a setting where you are on the opposite side of the spectrum of how Jon Snow was raised. Than basically she is the anti-christ figure of this story. The influences of power, titles, and the family name. Psychologically trained by her father Tywin, the fear of shame she brings in to her family with her love for her brother. Overly protective of her children which makes her extremely hostile and distrusting of others. It lines up perfectly with the prophecy. Its also been subtly foreshadowed earlier on that ''Prophecies are tricky''. Its a tiny indication of that very well being the case. Also GRRM confirmed it himself that prophecies aren't to be taken literally. It all works together and serves as one big deeper meaning.

&#x200B;

Gods plan is like a beautiful tapestry, and the tragedy of being human is that we only get to see it from the back.

(Daredevil Season 3 quote, but it fits my point)

This world and the God or God(s) who plan it, is like a beautiful tapestry. Everything weaving and falling into their rightful place. Prophecies, The Seven Pointed Star, The Red God, Tree Gods, etc...Are all one and the same, or at least lead into the same ultimate purpose. Which could be the meaning behind the strange markings left by the Children of the Forest and the White Walkers. A endless cycle of Ice meeting Fire, Life VS Death, Balance and one always having to serve both sides of the spectrum in order for it to be repeated all over again.

&#x200B;

In conclusion. If I were a betting man. I believe that balance will be restored. There will be death, and there will be life, anew. Jon or Daenerys, or BOTH may be dead before the credits roll. But not before a child is born.

As for Cersei and the Golden Company, they will lay waste to pretty much the rest of what remains of those at the Battle of Winterfell. This is where the handful of remaining main characters lives will be hanging by a thread. But Cersei will BARELY lose. And either Jon or Daenerys, whichever one is left alive, will rule the throne. I'm definitely leaning towards Jon Snow dying (NOOOOOOOOOO!!!) And Daenerys surviving with her overcoming her character arc and embodying the idea of what Jon Snow represents as a whole in the show. Jon will stab her in the heart with his death which will enforce that embodiment for which Jon's purpose was. She will then project that purpose left by Jon, onto the world which will set the stage of a more proper ruling.

But possibly shortly after she could die in the arms of Tyrion during childbirth. Leaving him to be the hand, and adviser to the new King/Queen.

As for Bran and the Night King. Something will be done that will either completely break the wheel, which will probably require Bran sacrificing himself in some way in order to prevent this from ever reoccuring ever again in the future, or will somehow manage to take the place of the Night King...

&#x200B;

BUT AGAIN! THIS IS ALL SPECULATION....Be gentle, this is literally the first thing I've posted online with such depth and passion. I know I completely ignored every other character but this to me was more of a general speculation of the overall narrative. I know some would argue that its all equally in its own right the main narrative in this world. But I'm thinking in terms of the bigger picture here.

I would love to hear your thoughts, please show some love. I'm also not the best at sentence structure. CHEERS",15,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bdqk7u/just_another_end_game_speculation/,2019-04-16 10:21:10
125,bqckfa,[Spoilers] Battle of The Trident,"In several places throughout the series we hear referenced, ""the Battle of The Trident"".. What is this, and why is it important, you might ask. 

The Trident is a river, several hundred miles north of King's Landing. It is here that the gauntlet was laid down and the rebels led by Robert Baratheon met the loyalists led by the Mad King's son Rhaegar Targaryen. It was a legendary battle that would help shape the political structure that is in place at the beginning of the television series. Many of the characters we hear of and meet during the series began their rise or died, during this battle.

It was the the endgame to the rebellion that began when Jon Snow's father, Rhaegar Targaryen eloped with Lyanna Stark and married her. Robert Baratheon, enraged, because he'd been promised Lyanna, went on a murderous warpath, fueled by his hatred of Targaryens, and enabled by the general discontent of the nobles tired of Targaryens rule.

At ""The Trident"" Robert Baratheon did defeat Rhaegar Targaryen in single combat at what would later be called the Ruby Ford, so named because when Robert's warhammer came crashing down upon Rhaegar's chest and mortally wounded him, it burst his plate armor asunder scattering precious rubies across the banks of the river. It was on this day that the fate of the Targaryen dynasty was sealed. Many atrocities remained to be carried out, murderous rampages, royal bloodletting, but it was here that the major question of where Westeros would head politically was answered.

152,bnlvif,[SPOILERS] Theory: John is Basically Already Dead,"I noticed in episode 4 when thormund pats Jon , Jon clutches his chest.  now that might be just because thormund is a big f***er. But the way they filmed it seemed deliberate. I think maybe the Lord of lights magic that was keeping Jon alive from his stab wounds will die out now that if the night king is dead. John has served his purpose. I don't think he'll die until after episode 5 but it is definitely a possibility he doesn't seem to have much stake in this fight with cersi. this could also be why ghost was sent back to the wall since that is and should be the actual resting place of Jon. Also rhaegal died and rhaegal was jons dragon. None of the Starks or the targaryens ""pets"" have died until there human either died or stopped being an honorable Stark/Targaryen. Obviously Jon is the definition of honor. I think John is a Dead Man walking and could literally die at any moment.  
Also Jon is with davos and davos would understand what is happening when Jon collapses. 
It's also possible that rhaegals death parallels jons where Jon's stab wounds slow him down on the battlefield and he gets killed.

Cause The Three Eyed Raven has killed him and is the true enemy to life! The Night King was protecting South of the Wall not coming to destroy it! He built the wall! To create a prison in order to keep the Children and The Three Eyed Raven locked in the north!

Why did Bran not enter the crypts of Winterfell to tell Jon about his mother? 

Same reason the NK never entered Bloodravens cave in the North. The magic kept him out! Who’s magic is locking the crypts? I’d assume the Night King’s! Kept beyond the wall (to the South) to keep the Three Eyed Raven from being able to reach them! 

Night King is Azor Ahai! But he’s the true protector of the 7 Realms. Made into the Night King to keep the evil locked away in the North!

180,bo6gab,[Spoilers] Bran changes the timeline!,"My theory is simple, and it relates back to the prophesy for Dany and when she would have children again.  How and when would the sun rise in the east?  2 answers: Never....or when time went backward.  Clearly she has become unhinged burning kings landing, she will probably kill Jon or Sansa next.  I don’t think the old Brandon Stark is completely gone and just the raven, and with his Hodor episode he clearly can manipulate time.  If he went back and stopped Roberts rebellion (perhaps killing the mad king early, or incapacitating Robert), then the sequence of events in the show would never take place.  Jon snow (Aegon) would be the heir to the iron throne. All the starks would be alive, Dany would be Jon’s aunt and have her own family.  And finally.... the white walkers and the night king would be alive again. Likely with the memory of what happened considering his supernatural status.  (At least the wall would be up).  It will be a tough choice to make, but Bran may make it at the last second if Dany chooses to burn the world.",24,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bo6gab/spoilers_bran_changes_the_timeline/,2019-05-13 21:27:58

199,1ef8nu,My thoughts on the Theon Greyjoy torture storyline,"I was incredibly fed up with it. I was going to voice how pointless and annoying it is after E07, and talk about how it's a useless distraction from the other fascinating storylines, say that they should just kill him off and be done with it.... But as I was putting these thoughts into words, I had a bit of a revelation.

I thought the Theon storyline was sorely lacking the rest of the story's characteristic commentary on human nature, because it's just about this little psychotic man torturing someone pointlessly. But I realized there is a deeper meaning to it, and it actually has given me another angle for looking at humanity. I'll try to explain.

The significance of Theon's torture isn't about causing pain to a helpless being. It might seem like he's just a chained animal, being hurt for someone's amusement but the choices made by his torturer reveal what makes him (and all of us) so much different from other animals:

Everything he's done to him has revolved around forms of torture that you could never subject a non-human animal to. The things he is exploiting in Theon are the things that define our humanity. This reveals something intrinsic about what it is to be human: our constant need to ask ""Why?"" and to understand our experiences and surroundings gives us a greater capacity for both joy and suffering.

The thing he leverages to psychologically torture Theon is the same thing that has given real-life people our gods (""Why do we exist?""), our science (""Why does this happen this way?""), our philosophy (""Why is this right or wrong?"") and a myriad of other important and uniquely human things. All of these are ways of coping with our endless, obsessive questioning of ""why"" everything.

The torture of Theon shows that no amount of pain inflicted on your physical body can rival the damage of taking away your sense of meaning, your understanding of your experiences and surroundings. And showing this brings about the more useful implication, which is the immeasurable positive value of having meaning, of seeking understanding and achieving a sense of purpose in life.

With this in mind, I'm slightly less dreadful of another drawn-out, cringeworthy scene of torture porn, and a little curious what aspect of human life will be examined next. Whatever happens in life, I can always be thankful I'm not coping with amputated genitals while being tied to a cross in an undisclosed location.",15,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/1ef8nu/my_thoughts_on_the_theon_greyjoy_torture_storyline/,2013-05-16 05:28:35

After hearing him sing in a scene during a rewatch, I realized his voice is really good (and it didn’t sound like a dubbed voice). I decided to look it up, and wouldn’t you know: the dude was a part of Robson & Jerome, who covered Unchained Melody in the mid-90’s and it stayed [at the top of UK charts for 7 weeks and sold over a million copies.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Flynn)

Oh, just another Azor Ahai theory.","I'm rewatching (again) and noticed that when Cersei and King Robert were having that intimate chat during the first season, Cersei mentions their son that ""died"" (which he nods- confirming that to be true). At her first mention of it to Catelyn, I thought she might have been lying to empathize with Cat, but that discussion with Robert has me believing they actually did have a child together. I have a feeling those theories that Gendry is her son are true. I also think it's Gendry who might be Azor Ahai. For one, he could forge the sword/Lightbringer as he is a smith. (""Darkness lay over the world and a hero, Azor Ahai, was chosen to fight against it. To fight the darkness, Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword."") Two, Arya was touched (pretty much choked) by the Night King and, even though she destroyed him, there's more to the story than that (I hope!)

248,36mzud,[S05E06] Why are critics/viewers so disgusted over the last scene?,"Seriously.

Dozens of characters have died from decapitation, torture or by being burned alive. Oberyn and Theon with arguably the worst cases. The show is full of incest, slavery and cannibalism. It was obviously not made for the sensitive types.

It was expected of psychopathic Ramsay to do a lot of fucked up shit. Nobody batted an eye when we found out Ramsay would slaughter past girlfriends if he got 'bored' of them (e.g. scene of that girl getting shot with a bow and mauled by his dogs).

But then suddenly this one scene crosses the line? What?

If people are complaining about this, then why not complain about the rape scene in Season 1? I mean, wasn't Daenerys technically raped by Khal Drogo? She obviously didn't want to marry/fuck him at the time, but she was forced. Did nobody find that rape scene a little odd?

257,2733mp,[S4E8]Some thoughts and ramblings on the Sansa/Littlefinger scenes.,"When Sansa is confessing/lying (ly-fessing) to that group in the Vale, she definitely has that troubled, upset little girl thing going on she does so well, but she picked her words well. She made arguments, ""You knew she was a troubled lady..."" She planned the best way to lie to them. You can see their faces soften as they believe her and Baelish. I liked juxtaposition of the woman whispering ""It's not your fault"" while Baelish does his super-creepy shit-eating grin. 

And Littlefinger, political mastermind, immediately turns this sympathy around on them, ""I want to know which side you're on."" Trying to draw them into a war under the pretense of supporting Robyn ""Milky"" Arynn. And, of course the exchange, ""He's a sickly little boy."" ""Sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men."" ""More often, they die young."" Is that foreshadowing? Is Baelish going to die? Who would kill him? Only Sansa knows his true colors, and she seems to be on his side. Or, it's probably Baelish just being coy. Probably.

Later, Baelish enters Sansa's chambers. She's meekly sewing or embroidering something, like she was four season ago. But Baelish says she isn't a child, she's a grown adult. He seemed genuine in his inquiry, ""Better to gamble on the man you know then the stranger you don't? You think you know me?"" He doesn't know the answer to that question: tries to hide it, hides it pretty well. She answers that she knows what he wants. 

We see Baelish again, with Robyn. He says to the boy, ""Don't worry about your death, worry about your life. Take charge of your life, for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of The Vale."" There was an emphasis on ""...to be *Lord of The Vale*"", an increased intensity. As he says that, he looks up at Sansa, walking tall and proud and very, very fine. You get the sense he was talking about himself when he was talking to Robyn. Lord of The Vale.

So what does he have in store for The Vale? More chaos? or does he have a plan this time, is he taking action, instead of setting things in motion and seeing how he can benefit from it?

And Sansa. Her hair was brown. Not red, like her mother. Brown, like her aunt, like the woman Baelish was able to get, like the lady regent of The Vale. Very symbolic. 

She knows what Baelish wants, her. 

And something Baelish said to her in her chambers must've sparked this. She had red hair, and didn't hardly look him in the eyes then. She was coy, yes, but still shy, too. Now she isn't. What was it? And how does it all tie in to ""what do we do to the ones who hurt the ones we love?"" from last episode?

263,289jtg,[S4E10/Speculation] Lets discuss the actual game of thrones at this point.,"So, with Tywin dead, Stannis kicking ass at the wall and Oberyn having angel three-ways right now, let's have a look at where the battle to rule currently stands, and make some predictions for what is next.

* Tommen is king right now, and I suppose Cersei is queen regent. Margaery has her sights set on Tommen, and unless Cersei goes extra crazy on her, I think she may successfully marry him and take control.
* Stannis got his loan from the iron bank (I'm pretty sure) and is proving that he's a king at the wall right now. With the north still fairly fractured from Robb's death, he could certainly amass a large army if he headed south.
* Danaerys isn't moving much, but presumably she still has her sights set on westeros. She's definitely got the muscle to take the throne, but she appears to want to make a perfect world across the sea first, so she seemingly could be there forever.
* Roose Bolton seems to have most of the north under his command, plus from a character standpoint he's a decent candidate to fill the hole Tywin left. I really don't like his odds against Stannis though.
* Dorne being a very very sizeable force which is no doubt unhappy about what happened to Oberyn should surely come into play next season. I haven't got a clue what their goals would be though, whether it's to rule or just revenge.
* Littlefinger and Sansa. Littlefinger has the Vale, which is no joke, but not quite enough to do some real damage. If he is still working with the Tyrells, he may have more plans to gain more power, but for now I think he'll be sticking to the shadows. Sansa is stuck with Littlefinger now for as long as it suits her.

Personally, I believe conflicts between Dorne and kings landing, as well as Boltons and Stannis are going to be the main source of turmoil for next season. Within kings landing, a battle for control of Tommen between Cersei and Margaery seems likely, and I haven't got a clue what happens to Arya, Jaime, Brienne, Tyrion and Varys will be up to but I think it'll be irrelevant to the battle for the throne. I don't believe Dany or Petyr will concern themselves with anything other than gaining power for now.

268,6x3jma,[Game of Thrones] What happened during the meeting between those 2 characters/The reason behind that look. SPOILERS,"I'm sorry if this has been said already but I did a lot of research and am seeing really 3 main ideas: Either Tyrion betrayed Dani to Cersei, he is jealous of Jon, or he is worried that their involvement will cloud Dani's judgment. The first one is absolutely bogus. This has arguably been the protagonist of the story since the beginning and his bretrayal would be extremely uncharacteristic. A case can be made for the other 2 ideas, although if I had to choose I would say he is worried the relationship will cloud Dani's judgment.

I propose another thought: Tyrion asked Cersei to lie to them. Tyrion is arguably the smartest character in the show, but it doesn't take a genius to realize that regardless what Cersei does, Dani and Jon have no choice but to march North to face the White Walkers. However, I think Tyrion doesn't trust Dani to face the White Walkers or at least not commit all her forces knowing that Cersei is plotting to attack them from the South. So Tyrion asks Cersei to lie and trick Dani to focus all her army and attention North. This also explains that look at the end. He knows he betrayed her, but not in a ""working with Cersei kind of way."" He lied to her for the greater good.

TL;DR Tyrion aske Cersei to lie and say she would help so the rest of them can focus all their efforts on the White Walkers.",19,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/6x3jma/game_of_thrones_what_happened_during_the_meeting/,2017-08-31 04:39:01

304,bex0kt,State of this subreddit,"**Tl;Dr**: Moderation on this sub is back; Rules are simplified; Looking for new mods; Episode discussions are also back.

# Seven blessings to everyone

This post is mostly in response to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bdl5b4/why_is_this_sub_trending/) by [u/EqualFortune](https://www.reddit.com/user/EqualFortune) and a plan on how to move forward.

As most of you are aware moderation in this sub has been slacking quite a bit: There hasn't been an episode discussion thread for the last season.

It also appears that I'm the last active mod. I have contacted the other mods, but they all have been inactive on reddit. I have therefore decided to change some things.

# New rules

I have simplified the rules greatly:

1. [reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette/)
2. No Spoilers in title
3. All spoilers must be marked
4. No book only content

The reddiquette includes quite a few things along the lines of no illegal content (leaks & streams). It also includes the rule to remember the human.

**Please do remember to report posts & comments breaking the rules.**

# New mods

There is also a need for some new mods. Moderation is not all that hard. If you are interested simply message me and we'll chat.

An interest in Game of Thrones is of course needed.

# Episode Discussions

Episode discussions will be back. Discussion for episode 1 should be there any moment now, discussion for episode 2 will go up when episode 2 is out.

# Edit: Chatroom

We now also have a chatroom for discussions, feel free to use it to discuss the show while it airs or later.",3,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/bex0kt/state_of_this_subreddit/,2019-04-19 13:02:16

310,1fk36v,[Spoilers S3E09] A Question for Strict Show Watchers....,"I am a book reader, but I certify that there are no spoilers here past S3E09. This is more of a question of your experience on the internet.

Some of us book readers who are a little more deliberate about not posting spoilers in non-spoiler areas were very intensely pissed off about the amount of people in completely non-related threads who would drop ""subtle"" hints about tonight's episode, and were worried that it would make show watchers ""expect"" something terrible to happen, or expect the result that did actually happen.

""These are my grandaughters blahblah and blahblah, twins. You could've had either. Could've had both for all I care.""  
""This is my youngest daughter blahblah. Hasn't bled yet, but you don't have the patience for all that, clearly."" 
""This is my granddaughter... blah? blahblah?..."" ""I'm Mary."" ""Fine.""

And of course the cheeky grin he gives Robb when he reveals the bride-to-be is a babe. And no matter how many times I watch it, I'll never believe the Red Wedding is about to happen until it's happening.

328,2315ra,S04E02 My Theory (SO MANY SPOILERS!),"Who Killed Joffrey Baratheon: A Case Study

I am doing this breakdown chronologically of  how I came to this conclusion so it jumps around a little, but I tried to explore all the theories that I noticed.  Granted there was a lot of pausing and rewatching a specific clip and rewatching the whole wedding scene about four times.  Following that cup is not easy, I’ll tell you what.  


Let us start at the beginning of the wedding.  Olenna Tyrell comes to talk to Sansa and says how horrible it is to kill a man at a wedding in regards to the Red Wedding and Robb Stark.  Olenna keeps touching her; Sansa’s hair, Sansa’s neck, Sansa’s cheek… stop.  It’s weird.  Now on the surface, it seems like she could have nothing to do with the assassination of King Joffrey because of her claim, but seeing as how anything goes I think it makes her more of a suspect. The Tyrells did it.

Lady Olenna tells Sansa that she should visit High Garden now that the war is over.  There is two reason for her to say this.  To give Tyrion and Sansa a safe place because Lady Olenna knows that they are not safe in King’s Landing.  OR… the fact that Sansa is still a key to the north.  Bolton might be the Warden by law, but he doesn’t have the people’s hearts.  Sansa Stark holds this power by being a Stark.  Having a Stark and a Lannister in High Garden would give the Tyrells power if they decided to make them captives.  She leaves says she wants to “et” some of the food she paid for.  Again, weird and uncalled for behavior.  The Tyrells did it.

Marjorie Tyrell announces that the leftovers of the feast are to be given to the poorest of King’s Landing.  Now if she knew the pie was poisoned she might not suggest this seeing as she actually seems to care about the unfortunate people in King’s Landing.  But maybe they didn’t expect there to be any leftover pie.  It is a feast after all. The Tyrells did it with the pie.

Let’s explore another theory; Tyrion is obviously upset about Joffrey's recreation of the War of the Five Kings.  He tells Pod to give the actors 20 gold coins each and they will have to think of another way to thank the king.  The fact that Tyrion says “will think” instead of “I (do) think” might mean that it wasn’t Tyrion.  Based on the wording it doesn’t sound like he has anything in mind right now.  I feel like if he was planning on killing his nephew he would either be a bit more discrete or have a better quip than that.  Tyrion might have done it.

When Joffrey suggests Tyrion join with the entertainment, Tyrion insults him which spurs Joffrey to pour wine over his head.  Tyrion tries some and nothing happens to him nor does he say it tastes funny or poisoned.  This could mean that Tyrion was checking to see if the poison was in there or n or just hasn’t poisoned it yet.  Tyrion might have done it.

Directly after this Marjorie calls Joffrey back to her.  She might be upset that he just wasted a cup she poisoned by spilling it all over Tyrion.  She says it is time for the toast meaning that Joffrey would surely drink.  But as of now, his cup is empty. Tyrells might have done it

Joffrey tells Tyrion to be his cupbearer.  This gives Tyrion the perfect opportunity to poison him.  Probably better than anyone else at the wedding and lord knows he has the motive.  I mean, who doesn’t at this point?  When he reaches for Joffrey's cup, Joffrey drops and kicks it so Tyrion has to crawl for it.  Sansa picks it up and hands it back to him.  We clearly see her hand over the cup and while it doesn’t look like she dropped anything in, she might have.  Sansa did it.

But Tyrion displaces this theory by handing the empty goblet to Joffrey.  If there was something in there, I feel as if he would have noticed it.  Although he is quite dumb at times...  Sansa didn’t do it.

 Marjorie then exclaims that the pie has arrived.  This stops Tyrion from having to kneel and diffusing the situation.  Now here is where it gets complicated.  Joffrey takes the cup from Tyrion and hands it to Marjorie.  Marjorie then turns and places it on the table behind her… right where her grandmother is sitting.  Tyrells did it.

Joffrey slices open the pie and we get a nice shot of white cream spilling out.  Foreshadowing?  Marjorie begins to feed her husband the pie. The Tyrells did it with the pie.

As Sansa and Tyrion begin to leave, Joffrey tells Tyrion to stay and continues to eat that pie.  He says the pie is dry.  Tyrion walks over the to Tyrell table after Marjorie directs him to the cup.  We get a nice shot of Olenna watching Tyrion.  Tyrion delivers it to Joffrey who takes a sip.  The Tyrells AND Tyrion did it.
Finally Joffrey begins to cough.  Yay!  Tyrion seems genuinely surprised by Joffrey cough like that.  Could be real, could be Tyrion faking it.  Joffrey turns around and looks right at Marjorie and she exclaims that he is choking.  Olenna calls for people to help their king.  Once again this reaction could be real or Olenna and Marjorie are faking it.  Who the fuck knows who killed him now.

Marjorie remains standing on the dais right next to Tyrion as Joffrey chokes on the ground.  Ser Dantos (Joffrey's fool) tells Sansa she must come with him right then if she wants to live.  Woah… weird.  What the fuck does he know? I guess Ser Dantos did it…?

Joffrey has enough strength to reach up and point at the dais.  Where he last saw bothe Marjorie and Tyrion.  Marjorie has moved over closer to her grandmother, but Tyrion remains in the same spot.  Tyrion is unfortunately picking the cup up right then.  Way to look guilty.  Joffrey dies.  My money is on Ser Dantos

Let’s revisit Ser Dantos and the previous episode.  Ser Dantos was a knight and became Joffrey’s fool for being drunk at his nameday tournament.  He stalks Sansa in the godswood and tells her this before giving her a necklace.  She thinks it ugly, but she’ll wear it with pride and wears it to the wedding.  

Remember back the the beginning of the wedding?  Sansa is wearing said necklace.  Lady Olenna kept… touching… Sansa.  All of a sudden you notice, one of the stones is missing from her necklace.  Or is just tucked under the collar of her dress.  If Lady Olenna stole the gem, maybe there was something hidden in it.  Ser Dantos sure knew what was up when Joffrey started to die. 

As far as motive for the Tyrells I feel like that is easy compared the the sleuthing I just did. Lady Olenna and Marjorie sat Sansa down and seriously asked about Joffrey.  As much as the Tyrells do want power, they still care about their family members.  In last week’s episode we see Marjorie’s disdain for Joffrey when she makes the comment about a sparrow head necklace.  At the ceremony after Joffrey kisses her Marjorie looks upset then breaks into a great big smile.  She doesn’t want to be married to him and Lady Olenna wants her granddaughter to be safe (which will never happen with Joffrey).

The Tyrells are almost as rich as the Lannisters and since this war had been going on has drained the crown and the Lannisters of money.  The Crown borrowed money from the Lannisters and has no way of paying it back, therefore the Lannisters are hurting financially.  The Tyrells on the other hand are doing just fine.  Lady Olenna mentions to Tywin that the Iron Bank (another lender to the Crown) is going to start closing in on them.  She makes another jest at the table when she is talking to Sansa that Tyrion would have a hard time coming up with the money to take Sansa to High Garden.

Killing Joffrey means Marjorie doesn’t have to be married to him and the Tyrells are obviously narrowing in on the Lannisters, trying to chip away at their power. 
 
In conclusion Ser Dantos used Sansa as a mule to smuggle in poison for Lady Olenna who snuck it in Joffrey’s drink which Tyrion had the misfortune of serving to Joffrey.  The Tyrells and Ser Dantos did it.  Tyrion and Sansa need to leave.


Edit: Sorry about the way I spelled some characters names.  I just didn't know how they were properly spelled.  
When I did this, I didn't just want to guess who it could be.  I wanted to do a slow walkthrough of each scene and see what the characters physically did.  I feel like everyone would have some sort of motive.  Hell, it could have been Tommen because he wanted to be king.  I left out theories like that because Tommen didn't DO anything.  I was looking at the actions more than anything else when I went through this.

I promise not to post any smart or coy replies; in fact I won't reply at all, I just wanted to see what some popular ideas or opinions are from non-readers.

Other book readers please refrain from replying to comments too.  No matter how well intentioned you are, you can still accidentally spoil something or influence someone's ideas on what will happen.

And if someone posts a bunch of ideas that seem suspiciously close to what does happen just ignore the post.  If there are replies calling the post out then people realize that the predictions may be true and its just another way of spoiling things.

345,6ze4ue,[Spoilers] The fate of Jon,"Jon Snow has had a nasty life. You all saw the show, you know what I mean. The most defining factors about Jon's character is that he's a bastard. He's not supposed to be alive, he is grateful for his every breath. What would give him more relief than the finding out who he really is? 

Therefore I propose that he never will. The proof will be burned, Bran's plan will fail somehow, (maybe because he has no turn-offs now,) maybe because someone will stop the information from reaching Jon or Daenerys.

Anyone on Daenerys's side can see how she and Jon work well together — even *JORAH* sees it. Many of us have been saying since the begining that they are meant to be together. He is the ice to her fire.

Wouldn't you say that it's in-character for Varys to push for a good rulership at the price of an incestuous one?

That'll be the tragedy of Game of Thrones. Jon will ride Rhaegal, he will rule on the Iron Throne next to his aunt Daenerys, never knowing his true identity. And Tyrion, Varys, Bran, Sam, and everyone else who knows about his parents are going to keep quiet to allow for a good kingdom, understanding this is how it's meant to be.

358,4zlwfm,GOT theory on Danys vision while in the house of the undying.,"So this is just a theory I came up with while re-watching game of thrones. This pertains to the show, not the books. 
In Danys vision while she is in the house of the undying she finds herself in 3 different locations. This definitely is foreshadowing for whats to come, but what exactly? I think I've somewhat figured it out.

Vision #1: Dany sees the throne room in kings landing destroyed and winter has come finally. She then approaches the Iron throne. She reaches out to touch the chair but then pulls away when she hears her dragons and walks towards the sound.

Vision #2: Dany finds herself going past the wall to the real North and while walking she sees a small tent out in the middle of nowhere. 

Vision #3: Dany walks into the tent to find Drago and their son happily sitting together. 

What does all of this mean? Simple. Kind of. Dany will arrive at Kings Landing and will take it back. In the process will destroy a lot of KL. The winter represents the nearing danger of the Nights King. What I really found interesting here was when Dany approached the Iron throne. When she went to reach for it, she pulled away at the last second. I believe this vision represents Dany taking the throne but not having a chance to actually rule and that is where the second vision comes into play. 

Dany crosses into the real north. Now I believe this represents Dany going to the North to finish off the White walkers. Whether with her army or only with her dragons. I'm assuming it will be with just her dragons, or maybe just one. Jon Snow will most likely be up there already.

The final vision, this represents Danys death. She will sacrifice herself for the greater good and give up all she has ever worked for but in the process will be reunited with Drago and her son. 

So there it is. Not sure if someone already came up with this or not. Let me know your thought.  ",16,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/4zlwfm/got_theory_on_danys_vision_while_in_the_house_of/,2016-08-26 04:46:33

362,398kuf,(Spoilers) My theory on where Drogon takes Dany,"**I believe that it is very likely that Drogon takes Dany to Old Valyria in [S5] [E10].** Here's the evidence behind my reasoning: (1) remember where Jorah and Tyrion last saw Drogon? *He was flying over Valyria:* [[screenshot]] (http://imgur.com/wI4kC0J), (2) the episode description for [S5 E10] say that *""Dany finds herself surrounded by strangers.""* I think those ""strangers"" are the stonemen in Valyria, and (3) I think that the opening shot of the preview for next week's episode is a shot of Valyria: [[screenshot]] (http://imgur.com/yT0aago). It makes sense that the preview would lead off by answering one of the biggest questions the end of [S5 E9] left us with: where the hell is Drogon going to take Dany?

Her visit to Valyria would make a lot of sense given that it is the ancestral home of her family and the dragonmasters. I then think one (or more) of the following could happen between her and the stonemen: (1) she has the ability to heal greyscale, (2) they show loyalty to Dany and Drogon. They more than likely have seen Drogon flying overhead and maybe even interacted with him at this point, and/or (3) they have a hidden stash of stone dragon eggs that Dany awakens.

Littlefinger is/was madly in love with Cat, what do you guys think his reaction to the events would be?
He has spies all over so it seems unlikely that he wouldn't have known about the plot. However if he had no clue about it then I'd guess he would be pretty pissed. It's the love of his life.
With him marrying her sister then it puts him in a good and valid position to try and enact revenge. His wifes wishes (if she stops acting so mental) and his own vengeance.

The fact that there is a track with a certain title contains a clue that the thing referred to in the title is important and there will probably be plot developments featuring the thing in some way.

378,36qbra,The real problem with season 5 no one seems to be talking about.,"OK, we all know that the Water Garden/Rape/inquisition story lines are stretched and nonsensical at this time. However, I am not bothered by them as much because I can suspend disbelief. The real issue with this season is that there in no chemistry based, suspenseful dialogue that makes the series so great. 

Remember Robert talking to Ned, reminiscing about the old days? You just knew these guys were going to live until the end of the series.

Tywin chatting with Arya at Harrenhall, not knowing her identity? I was sometimes on the edge of my seat, praying she did not get found out.

Remember Tyrion and Cersei going back and forth? Unreal chemistry, humor and oneupsmanship. Every scene was bad assed.

Remember Jamie and Brienne, going back and forth from enemies to sworn and bonded allies? Great transitional dialogue and redemption.

The Rob Stark strategy discussions with Catlyn? The heartbreak when they watched each other dying?

The slow realization that things really were going to get worse for Theon from the hands of Ramsey.

Jon Snow becoming a man and and bonding with his brothers on the wall, while hiding his feelings for his true love?

The evil Joffrey mentally breaking down, and unknowingly building up, Sansa Starks metal capacity.

This season has no awesome, powerful dialogue and intense chemistry like the first 4 seasons. Hopefully it gets better from here. Feel free to share your favorite conversation. For some reason, I really loved the one between Cersei and Robert, when they are talking about the Dothraki invasion, and it turned to them talking about there failed marriage in a mutually respectfull way. It is one of 2 times in the whole series that Cersei shows actual signs of humanity.

388,6vwrqi,Theory: Arya to Kill LF to get to Cersei?,"Just a thought - IF the strange shenanigans between Sansa and Arya are to throw off Baelish, to what end? Of course, his betrayal of Ned is reason enough, not including his laundry list of misdeeds, but I feel like the attention to this plot line serves a larger purpose than simple revenge.

Little Finger is A suitable match for Arya in wits. He is also, debatably, just as sneaky. But the last thing they share in common is that they both, essentially, trust no one, in order to survive. Even with her acquired training, he is too big a target for Arya to chance him cleverly evading her in some way. So she would think to use the one weakness he has to bring him down. That weakness is Sansa.

It's clear that creepy Petyr has projected his feelings for dead Cat Stark, onto her similarly featured and strong-willed daughter.

The jist is: At some point off-screen, the sisters discussed taking out Littlefinger. They up the play-fighting to boost his self-confidence and sense of security with Sansa. When the dagger is exchanged between them, I believe this was the go-ahead for their plan, since Brienne, the inevitable intervenor, is off to King's Landing and they have Petyr now convinced by their charade.

Sansa is used as sexual and/or romantic bait for Littlefinger, then Arya arrives to finish the deed and own his identity. 

No one in Winterfell, except Bran, has to be privy to his death since Arya can take his place long enough to say he's leaving for King's Landing. With or without Sanaa's knowledge, Arya will use the face of Petyr Baelish to get to Cersei Lannister and check her off the kill list.

Little finger is a known snake in the grass, and kin to Cersei's thirst for power. She'd accept a meeting with him under the assumption that he was once again going to betray the now weakened North for his own gain. 

Arya's kill list has to mean something. Sure, she's taken out a lot of people, and the most worthy being Walder Frey, but Public Enemy Number One remains Cersei Lannister. As per the Red Priestess Melisandre's Season 3 quote when speaking to Arya: ""I see a darkness in you. And in that darkness, eyes staring back at me. Brown eyes, blue eyes, green eyes. Eyes sealed shut forever. We will meet again.""

I believe those green eyes belong to Cersei. And what would all of her training and suffering have meant if not to finish off the cruel woman who oversaw her father's wrongful execution? It would be a very gratifying end to all three character's stories.

Now tear it to peices and tell me what you think. :)",11,31,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/6vwrqi/theory_arya_to_kill_lf_to_get_to_cersei/,2017-08-25 10:30:44

In the episode ""The Climb"" there is a big convo where they talk about how they have their different philosophies on how the realm should be run. Varys through order and Littlefinger through chaos. Both characters are also known to have a number of spies.

I'm starting to think that all of the events of the show are being manipulated by those two characters. Littlefinger was revealed to be behind the murder of Joffery and Jon Aryn. And in season one we know that Varys has some plans with Dany.

With only a few episodes left before we reach the end of season 3, what do you all think will be the big climax of this season?

As for myself, I think we will end up with one of these scenario's for the climax:

* Robb Stark, after gaining an army from Walder Frey, will march towards Casterly Rock. The ensueing battle will be the climax of the season. (And would give Robb's army a satisfying victory after many ""downs"")

432,1fmc6p,[Speculation] [S03E09] Thoughts on Season 3 finale,"We can all agree that this show is open to bringing people back from the dead right? 

Be it the general nature of white walkers
Be it season 2 with Drogo and the witch
Or season 3 with the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners and how he was revived numerous times.


We already know that the Lord of Light can bring people back, and especially Beric. And considering Beric was very fond of Ned Stark what are the odds that they can bring back Robb as a favor to his old friend(?)?

I feel like there is something odd about them completely erasing the entire Stark storyline (no I am not including Arya or Bran's story) from the show in one fell swoop. It also seems odd that they put a whole lot of effort into showing the power of resurrecting Beric only to have Melisandre pretty much say ""Thats cool bro, but I just want the boy"" and leave. And considering the show has previously established ""Only death can bring life"" I am saying Beric gives his life to bring back Robb.

tl;dr: Season 3 emphasizes the power of resurrection without doing anything with it. Season 3 then kills off some huge characters again. Therefor season 3 has to end with one of them coming back

Question from last night's episode.

Do you think Wylis/Hodor always realized the reason why he became Hodor? From re-watching the episode, I think you can strongly argue that Wylis actually sees Bran in the past just before he becomes Hodor. But throughout the series, there's no indication that Hodor is aware that it was Bran all along. Even with his inability to talk, you'd think he would be uneasy whenever Bran is around.

The show runners have lots of room to move but ultimately pushing Bran off of the tower has got to catch up to him. Having Brienne on his side may help him get acceptance in Winterfell at first but I think it will be short lived. At some point Bran will look to reference something that triggers his memory. He will confide in Arya who will in turn kill Jaime.
Arya is not someone who will be hanging around Winterfell hoping to find a prince. She will always be a faceless man and be traveling all over the world. I think her first order of business will be with the Hound in Kings landing where she will Kill Cersei and fulfill the prophecy as told by Maggie the frog by doing it as Jaime. Clegane bowl materializes and the Hound kills the Mountain but Arya must put the Hound out of his misery. This time she will do it.

Set in the 9th century AD, many of the separate kingdoms of what we now know as England have fallen to the invading Vikings, only the great Kingdom of Wessex stands defiant under its visionary King Alfred the Great (Dawson). It is the last kingdom.

Against this turbulent backdrop lives Uhtred (Dreymon). Born the son of a Saxon nobleman, he is orphaned by the Vikings and then kidnapped and raised as one of their own. Forced to choose between the country of his birth and the people of his upbringing, his loyalties are ever tested. What is he — Saxon or Viking? On a quest to claim his birthright, Uhtred must tread a dangerous path between both sides if he is to play his part in the birth of a new nation and, ultimately, recapture his ancestral lands.

The Last Kingdom is a show of heroic deeds and epic battles but with a thematic depth that embraces politics, religion, warfare, courage, love, loyalty and our universal search for identity. Combining real historical figures and events with fictional characters, it is the story of how a people combined their strength under one of the most iconic kings of history in order to reclaim their land for themselves and build a place they call home.*


They just aired the 5th episode and it's really starting to pick up.  I've read the first 6 books and if the show stays true it should turn out to be a great series, and it has so far although slightly sped up.  Similar to GoT in that there's a crapload of characters, it make take you a few episodes to get a handle on everyone.

475,6wy7w4,(Spoilers?) Viserion and all that.,"I've had some musings since episodes 6 and 7 regarding our favourite blue eyed dragon. Is Viserion more like an undead, mindless wight; or similar to a White Walker ('intelligent' so to say).

My thinking goes like this: After the battle of Hardhome, when we see the Night King raise more wights than you can throw your Nan at, all he does to raise them is his lifty-up-arms-thingy. Compare this to when he actually touches the human baby and it turns into a white-walker. After dragging Viserion out of the water, the Night King physically places his hand on Viserion (like the babies), and the rest is history.

Is there something in all this, or am I just overthinking to fill the void for a year until next season? To me, a brainless wight-dragon seems decidedly less scary/dangerous than a sentient dragon.
tl;dr Is Viserion more like a wight or a white-walker (in terms of ""intelligence"")?",16,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/6wy7w4/spoilers_viserion_and_all_that/,2017-08-30 14:23:57

489,1gi5eo,[BUSINESS] Rules discussion,"Greetings Knights of Summer, thank you for taking the time to read this post. Today the moderators want to open the floor to the community to discuss the rules. We have done this previously, but at a time when the community was much smaller. We recognise that a rules update is required and think it's vitally important that you are able to have your say. The moderators have all read the books, so this is your place more than it is ours. Each of us do have our own opinions though, and we reserve the right to share them as part of this discussion. Other book readers in the community are welcome to share their thoughts as well.

**We will take upvotes into account for serious rules suggestions, but downvotes will be ignored. Don't downvote an opinion or suggestion that you disagree with, debate it.**

The current rules are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------


1. **Follow [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)**

2. **No spoilers in post titles.** If you wish to ask a question about an aspect of the show, use a title such as *""[S2E05] A question about Theon""*. Events up to and including the specific episode in question do not have to be tagged as spoilers within such a post.

3. **Speculation threads are for show watchers only. Book readers are not permitted to post in any speculation threads.** The only exception is corrections of the names of places and people in the show. ***VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE BAN.***

4. **Content exclusively from the ASOIAF novels is strictly forbidden.** This includes comparing differences between the novels and the HBO show. Some fans of the show will go on to read the books later.

5. **Posting to articles that contain spoilers is acceptable** so long as those articles are specifically about the show and the link title is properly tagged. Users can click at their own risk.

6. **Do not post image macros, memes, pictures of GoT actors outside of GoT, or other 'silly' content.** These items are welcome in the official weekly silly thread.

7. **If you believe a post contains spoilers use the report button and do not downvote.** This rule is mostly for the book readers in the community. Sometimes non-readers speculate accurately and a raft of downvotes will essentially confirm that they are correct, thus creating a spoiler where there was not one before.

8. **Links to and discussion of illegal means to watch the show are not allowed.**

-----------------------------------------------

When the new rules are finalised we will be implementing a subreddit wiki to house them. We will be writing an FAQ. If you have a question that you think would be pertinent for an FAQ, please submit them here also.",35,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/1gi5eo/business_rules_discussion/,2013-06-17 11:38:33
490,1bqcz4,Do people know this subreddit exists?,"It's been a year and there's only a thousand subscribers and there's barely any content or discussion. Is it because people don't know that there's a subreddit just for the T.V. show? It must be because I don't see any other reason why this place is so dry, specially for a show as popular as GOT. 

How can we get more people to subscribe? Would allowing memes or image macros bring more people in? What can we do to make HBOGameofThrones grow because I really want a place where I can discuss the T.V. show only but there's really not that many people with whom to have a discussion with.

Maybe we can bring more mods in to improve the design of the subreddit because it looks pretty .... basic. No offence to the current mods.

496,6w9r5f,Episode Discussion Megathread - Season 7 Episode #7 - The Dragon and the Wolf! (Finale!),"Here it is Ladies and Sers, the Finale of season 7! At 80 minutes of runtime, this is longer than last week, and by extension the new longest episode ever!

Here's a detailed summary of last week if you need a recap:

**At Winterfell**

At Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death.

Arya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay.

Sansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear.

Later, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice.

The following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.

Following the events of the Wight Hunt, Sansa enters Arya's quarters and opens a leather case containing several ""faces"", including the literally late Walder Frey's face. Arya catches her sister pilfering through her personal effects. When Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her, Arya mockingly retorts that they are not here. Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the ""faces"" are.

Arya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger.


**At Dragonstone**

Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to ""heroes"" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom ""do stupid things, trying to outdo the others"". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her – to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward. The two then turn their attention to the topic of their impending meeting with Queen Cersei in King's Landing. Tyrion admits that Cersei cannot be trusted and could be setting a trap for them, but that Daenerys will have the Unsullied, the Dothraki and her dragons at hand; if anyone tries to harm her, King's Landing will be leveled to the ground in response.

Daenerys wonders whether, given that Cersei will almost certainly be attempting to double-cross them, they should be planning something similar. Tyrion is firmly against any deceit, counseling Daenerys that while she needs a healthy degree of fear to instill respect, she cannot rule through fear alone, as leaders who rule through fear alone like Cersei, Tywin, and Joffrey are hated by their people and forever vulnerable to being overthrown. Tyrion reminds Daenerys about her vision of creating a new society by ""breaking the wheel"" rather than merely imitating prior rulers like Aegon Targaryen, and cautions her about her temper and impulsiveness, citing the fiery executions of Lord Randyll Tarly and his son Dickon. Daenerys asserts that such an action was necessary, but Tyrion still believes she should have attempted more merciful means of dealing with the problem the Tarlys posed, or at least left them alive long enough to consider her other options rather than having them summarily executed. As Daenerys becomes increasingly agitated in the face of Tyrion's blunt but reasonable remarks, he reassures Daenerys that he supports her vision and ideals. Tyrion also proposes that Daenerys consider a succession plan in the event of a disaster, given that by her own admission, she believes she is incapable of bearing children but she refuses to consider this plan until she has donned the crown, also coldly blaming Tyrion's policy of caution for causing her the loss of Highgarden, Ellaria Sand, and Yara Greyjoy.

**The Wight Hunt**

Jon Snow and his ranging party travel through the lands beyond the wall on their mission to capture a Wight. Gendry complains about the bitter cold and asks Tormund about life as a Wildling. Tormund later confides with Jon about the foolhardy nature of their mission, while Jon discusses his difficult negotiations with Daenerys. Tormund points out that the pride of the Northmen may cost them too many lives, citing Mance Rayder and the Wildlings as an example. While walking, Gendry also confronts the Brotherhood Without Banners about selling him off as a sacrifice to Melisandre. Sandor Clegane sneers that Gendry should be grateful that he is still alive and points out that Beric Dondarrion has been kiled six times (including once by Sandor himself) ""and you don't hear him bitching about it"". Not entirely sure what to think of that particular revelation, Gendry accepts a drink form Thoros's wineskin.

While walking, Jon and Jorah Mormont also chat about their relationships with their fathers Eddard Stark and Jeor Mormont respectively. They say that their fathers were good and honorable men and did not deserve their deaths. Jon tells Jorah about the brutal death of Jeor at the hands of the Mutineers and that Eddard was beheaded. Jon tries to return Jorah his father's Valyrian sword Longclaw but Jorah tells him that he is not worthy to bear his father's sword and tells Jon to keep it.

Later, Sandor and Tormund trade jabs about sex. Sandor takes offense when Tormund asks about how he burnt his face. Tormund then confides in Sandor about his infatuation for Brienne of Tarth, who is nearly as tall as Sandor. He jokes about having ""monstrous"" babies with her, to Sandor's utter bewilderment. Beric and Jon talk about Eddard Stark and how they have both been resurrected by worshipers of the Lord of Light. Beric tells Jon that he is fighting for life because death is the first and last enemy; it is inevitable, but it is human nature to fight it for as long as you can. He warns Jon that they have to work together to fight death and defend those who cannot defend themselves. Jon reflects on his Night's Watch oath about being the ""shield that guards the realms of men"" and agrees. Sandor sees the mountain from his vision lying ahead and steers the group in that direction.

While trudging through a snowstorm, Jon and his party sight a massive snow bear with blue eyes approaching them. The snow bear turns out to have been resurrected by a White Walker. The monstrous creature mauls and kills three of their company. Beric and Thoros manage to set the snow bear alight with his flaming sword but it continues to attack, forcing Thoros to get in its' way when it attacks Sandor. Thoros is unable to break free of its jaws until Jorah stabs it with a dragonglass dagger. Beric cauterizes Thoros' wounds with his flaming sword.

Jorah asks the wounded Thoros about his experience charging with a flaming sword during the Siege of Pyke, and commends his old comrade for his drunken bravery. While navigating through the mountain, they see a column of Wights marching through the canyon below. The ranging party plants a fire and then ambushes the Wights and the White Walker leading the pack. Jon Snow manages to kill the White Walker with Longclaw, causing most of the Wights associated with it to disintegrate, while the rest of the group manages to capture the only unaffected Wight. Sandor tries to silence the creature but gets bitten as it cries for help. Jorah and Sandor managed to muzzle and bind the creature together.

As a horde of Wights approach, Jon sends Gendry back to Eastwatch to bring news to Daenerys. The Wights pursue the group over a lake of ice. One of the ranging party is captured by the horde but manages to drag many of the Wights down with him when the ice collapses under their weight. Gendry manages to outrun the Wights after lending his hammer to Tormund. Meanwhile, Jon and his ranging party manage to retreat to the middle of an icy lake to escape the wights. Throughout the night, Jon and his comrades wait in the middle of the ice while encircled by the army of the Undead. Meanwhile, Gendry reaches Eastwatch's outer gates but collapses from exhaustion. Davos Seaworth and several guards attend to him. When Davos asks what happened, Gendry tells him to fetch the Maester and to send ravens to Daenerys.

In the morning, Jon and his company awake to find that Thoros has died from his wounds. Beric and Sandor pay their last respects, with the former praying for the Lord of Light to guard them. At Jon's insistence, they burn the body with Beric's flaming sword. The Wights watch while their captive Wight struggles under its hood and restraints. Jorah proposes killing the Wight but Jon counters that they need to keep it as evidence. Beric suggests that Jon kill the Night King, who has just arrived on horseback; given that they've seen killing a Walker destroyed the wights it controlled, killing the Night King might destroy them all. He then adds that the Lord of Light has not resurrected Jon for no reason, but Sandor reminds him that they have just lost their priest, and Beric is now down to his last life.

After receiving Gendry's message from Eastwatch, Tyrion implores Queen Daenerys, who has donned a cold-weather version of her Targaryen garb, not to leave for the North because it is too risky. Daenerys counters that he told her to do nothing before and she lost. Dissatisfied with his advice, Dany leaves with all three dragons to the lands beyond the Wall to aid Jon Snow and his ranging party.

Bored, Sandor hurls two rocks at one of the undead minions, knocking its jaw off. The second however, skids across the ice, and both the party and the undead quickly realize the ice, which has hardened overnight, is strong enough to support their weight, and in ever-increasing numbers, the horde attacks the group's position. Sandor holds them back with Gendry's hammer while Jon and the other members of the ranging party join in, wielding weapons of fire, dragonglass or Valyrian steel. Beric manages to set several of the Wights alight with his flaming sword. The ranging party hack and slash at the Wights with their blades but are unable to stem the tide. With the group overwhelmed, Jon orders them to fall back to the highest part of the island. Tormund is dragged into the ice by several Wights but is saved from death by Sandor, who drags him back onto the island. The group continues fighting against the Wights. One of the Wildlings falls off a ledge and is ripped apart by the creatures, who begin to scramble up the ledge towards Jon's group.

When all seems lost, Queen Daenerys arrives with her dragons, who attack the wights with dragonfire. Hundreds of Wights are burned to ashes while others collapse under the ice, which is melted by dragonfire. Jon and his party rush to Daenerys and her dragon Drogon, dragging their captive Wight with them, while Viserion and Rhaegal provide covering fire from above. Meanwhile, the Night King obtains an icy javelin from one of his lieutenants and hurls it at Viserion, scoring a direct hit. Viserion is struck in the neck and plunges helplessly into freefall, shrieking in agony as blood and fire pour from the fatal wound. Drogon and Rhaegal cry out for their brother, but are powerless to help him as Daenerys watches in horror and sorrow. Viserion crashes onto the frozen lake, shattering the ice, and slowly sinks beneath it.

As the Night King readies another spear, Jon tries to fight his way to him, but is dragged under the ice by two Wights. Before falling under the ice, he hollers at Daenerys and company to leave with her remaining dragons. Daenerys and the survivors of Jon's ranging expedition flee with Drogon and Rhaegal before the Night King can kill them. He hurls the second javelin, but Drogon narrowly dodges it. With the dragons gone, the Night King and his army leave the scene. Later, Jon Snow climbs out of the ice, finding Longclaw fortuitously right in front of him. Jon tries to pretend to be a Wight but is spotted and pursued by a large horde. Before the Wights can finish the King in the North, his uncle Benjen Stark appears on horseback with his flaming flail. Benjen tells Jon to flee on his horse while he stays behind to buy time for Jon to escape. While riding away on horseback, Jon watches his uncle being overwhelmed and killed.

**At Eastwatch**

Sandor carries the struggling Wight into a boat. Tormund and Beric tell him they will meet again but Sandor retorts he hopes not. Daenerys sends Drogon and Rhaegal to scour the surrounding mountains for Jon. Jorah tells Daenerys that it is time to leave but she insists on waiting a bit longer. Before she can leave, they hear a horn blowing signalling a rider approaching. Looking down from the battlements, Dany sees a wounded Jon Snow approaching on horseback. Aboard their ship, Davos and Gendry tend to Jon Snow, who has suffered severe hypothermia and several minor injuries. Daenerys also notes the massive scars on his chest from his previous fatal wounds.

**In the Narrow Sea** 

Jon Snow wakes to find Daenerys watching over him in his chambers. Jon apologizes for the disastrous ranging party and the fact it caused Viserion's death, but Daenerys tells him not to apologize because she now knows that the Army of the Dead is real. Overcome with emotion, she tells Jon that the dragons are the only children she will ever have, and vows that she and Jon will together destroy the Night King. Jon thanks her for her support, addressing her as ""Dany"", and Daenerys realizes that the last person to address her by that name was her older brother Viserys Targaryen, who Daenerys remembers as not being a good person. Jon apologizes and asks if ""My Queen"" would be more appropriate; realizing he is agreeing to bend the knee, Daenerys asks Jon what the Northern lords loyal to him will make of this. Jon assures her they will come to see her for the good person she is, as he already has. Touched by his statement, Daenerys gently takes Jon's hand in her own for a moment. They gaze into each other's eye for a moment – a long moment – but Daenerys suddenly pulls away and tells him to get some rest and leaves him alone.

**Elsewhere**

Later, hundreds of Wights use several large chains to drag Viserion's corpse out of the frozen lake as the Night King and one of his lieutenants watch. When the dragon's corpse is dragged far enough out of the lake, the Night King walks over and places his hand upon Viserion's snout. All is quiet for a moment... and then Viserion's eyes snap open, shining icy blue.

497,6w274f,[Theory] About how Cersei will fulfill her prophecy,"TL;DR: Cersei uses the prophecy to her advantage and tells Jaime to kill her so that she can be reanimated by the Night King

Longer answer: As Cersei's prophecy came true, she seems to more and more accept all that it says as inevitable. She marries the king, she has three children, she knows how many of Robert's bastards exist. When Joffrey dies, she is anguished. When Myrcella dies, she is upset, but IMO in more of an obligatory way. When Tommen dies, my impression of her reaction is that she simply expected it to happen and had already detached herself from the situation.

The next part of the prophecy is that she will be killed by the valonquar. Knowing this and accepting it as inevitable she has searched for a way to remain in power even though she knows she must die. The logical answer to this is that she will fulfill the prophecy in her way by asking/ordering/coerceing Jaime to kill her and then be reanimated by the Night King. Incidentally, this leads into the Night Queen theory.

Side theory, perhaps related, is that I think Qyburn used some of the Citadel knowledge of the creation of the Walkers to reanimate the Mountain by inserting Dragonglass into his heart. This would make Qyburn a key element in helping Cersei understand how to put into effect her plan.

498,6t9pyq,Episode Discussion Megathread - Season 7 Episode #5 - Eastwatch!,"Week 5 is here, and with it winter's grasp grows ever stronger! The dead are coming, to **Eastwatch** by the sea! This week's episode, directed (again!) by Matt Shakman, is reported to clock in at 59 minutes. So again we have a standard hour, however last episode we learned that timing isn't everything as with only 50 minutes they blew so many of us away. This also marks the end of short(er) episodes this season as episodes #6 and #7 are reported to be 71 and 81 minutes respectively!

Here's a summary of last week if you need a recap:

**In King's Landing**

Cersei assures Tycho that the Crown's debts to the Iron Bank will be paid in full. Tycho guarantees that, once the debt is paid, the Bank is willing to issue a new loan to expand her armies. Cersei then reveals that Qyburn has contacted the Golden Company to fight for the Lannisters against Daenerys' forces.

**At Winterfell**

Littlefinger presents Bran with the Valyrian steel dagger that was used in the attempt on Bran's life. Littlefinger tries to get Bran to tell him of his experiences after fleeing Winterfell, and is disconcerted when Bran repeats to him Littlefinger's earlier remark to Varys that ""chaos is a ladder."" Meera visits Bran to say farewell, as she wants to be with her family when the White Walkers attack. Bran is indifferent to her departure, and a dismayed Meera remarks that Bran figuratively died in the Three-Eyed Raven's cave.

Arya arrives at Winterfell, and evades the guards to visit Ned's tomb in the crypts, where Sansa finds her. After the two sisters reunite, Sansa takes Arya to see Bran in the godswood. Arya is taken aback to find that Bran knows of her kill list, and Bran gives her the Valyrian steel dagger as a shocked but seemingly approving Sansa looks on. As the three return to the castle, Podrick reassures Brienne that she has fulfilled her oath to Catelyn. She denies it, saying she has done next to nothing.

Later, Brienne and Podrick are sparring when Arya asks to practice with Brienne. Despite Brienne's superior size, Arya's skills learned from the Faceless Men, the Hound and from Syrio's Braavosi water dance allow her to fight Brienne to a draw.

**At Dragonstone**

Jon shows Daenerys the vast mine of Dragonglass. Venturing further into the caves, he shows her carvings made on the cave wall by the Children of the Forest, depicting the Children and the First Men fighting together against the White Walkers. Seemingly convinced that Jon is telling the truth, Daenerys vows to fight for the North, but only if Jon bends the knee. Jon remains unsure.

As they emerge from the cave, Tyrion and Varys report that, although Casterly Rock was taken, the Unsullied's fleet has been burned; furthermore, Highgarden has fallen to the Lannisters. Frustrated with her sequence of defeats, Daenerys asks Jon for his counsel. Jon remarks that if she uses her dragons to attack King's Landing, she will be no different than the other tyrants who previously ruled the Seven Kingdoms.

Some time later, Theon and the rest of the Ironborn survivors return to Dragonstone. Jon accosts Theon, telling him that his role in Sansa's escape is the only reason Jon doesn't kill him right there. Theon asks to see Daenerys to request her help in rescuing Yara, but is told that she is gone.

**On the Roseroad**

The Lannister caravan departs Highgarden, laden with gold and food. Jaime gives Bronn a large satchel of gold for women and the spoils of war, and dissuades him from asking for Highgarden as the castle promised to him.

As the caravan approaches King's Landing, the Lannisters and Tarlys are surprised by an attack from Daenerys, riding Drogon and leading her horde of Dothraki. Drogon burns all the food wagons and caravans on the way to King's Landing and breaks the Lannister defence, while the Dothraki battle through the army. Jaime, failing to bring Drogon down by using regular arrows, commands Bronn to find Qyburn's Scorpion.

Drogon and the Dothraki decimate most of the Lannister army, but Bronn is able to wound Drogon with the Scorpion, and Daenerys is forced to dismount to remove the bolt. Jaime tries to run Daenerys down, but Drogon shields her and Jaime is almost incinerated before Bronn tackles him off his horse at the last moment. Jaime falls in the Blackwater Rush and begins to sink to the bottom of the river, weighed down by his armour.
