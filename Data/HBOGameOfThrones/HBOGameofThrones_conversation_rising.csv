0,18/20, 7/20. How was I meant to remember that?,20/20 woo!,nice!,maybe it is rewatch /re-read time :D,"perfect score, gratz!",The quiz hung onto the smallest possible details to be fair,I love the design but I can understand if they changed it because they thought he might end up having to fight Jon Snow.,Do The Sopranos instead,"If you do, stop at the end of season 6, when our queen sets sail for Westeros.","My wife and I are going through it, as she‚Äôs never seen the show. We‚Äôve made it to late season 4. She‚Äôs hooked and I‚Äôve told her how the show takes a downward slope later on.",As a fan of Game Of thrones I say yes,"After that, start The Wire. Best show I‚Äôve ever seen, hands down.","Far better show with a far better ending.

It actually makes me kind of sad how my generation *just* missed the Sopranos when it first aired, and have enjoyed this golden age of television without ever knowing or appreciating the show that helped start it all (credit also to the Wire and Oz, of course). I know very few people that have seen it, and it‚Äôs getting harder and harder to get people to watch it - the second half of the show still looks great, but those first couple of seasons look pretty fucking dated now.",As a fan of Game of Thrones until season 5 I say watch half and make your own ending.,Excited! Can‚Äôt wait!,I just hope we see a legit full size Black Dread and not a rehashed Drogon,Meh. It‚Äôs over,"Looks like another series is still in development, however, so that's good I guess?",I read an article about this. I think they‚Äôre just delaying it. So nothing to worry about i guess,"Its still too soon in my pov. I mean they took years between seasons, i‚Äôd be okay with a reboot in 10 years, jm good right now.","The series called ‚ÄúBloodmoon‚Äù made by Jane Goldman which would be set thousands of years ago based around The Long Night had its pilot made in the Summer and it‚Äôs this show that‚Äôs been cancelled.

‚ÄúHouse of the Dragon‚Äù is a show based on the Targaryen family made by Miguel Sapochnik and Ryan Condal which has just had an entire series ordered. 

First there were four shows in development, then it was five, and then went down to three. With Goldman‚Äôs being cancelled that means there is still one other show still remaining that hasn‚Äôt yet been cancelled or ordered.","It's a prequel though, not a reboot. A show set 1000 years prior will have all new characters, plot, locations etc.",Wow ü§Ø,"Closeups, materials and progress pictures of the builds can be seen on his Facebook page, [Pete's Props](https://www.facebook.com/petesprops/).",This is amazing. I would like to know what qualifies as an improper build,Magical,"That would be a cool cake, I watch a lot of crazy baking cooking shows and my first thought was cake....he did a good job",Forgot I was still subscribed to this sub...
