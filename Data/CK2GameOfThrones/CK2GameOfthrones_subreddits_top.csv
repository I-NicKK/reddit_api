2,dl6w49,Crusader Kings III,"Just a quick update from me about the announcement of CK3. I wont be taking the lead on any CK3 version of the AGoT version of the mod. As much as I'd like to I simply dont have the time to commit to such a major project these days. However the able PaxterRedwyne and Kuczaja are looking at putting something together and will no doubt have more information soon.

As for the CK2 version of the mod I fully intend to keep the mod up to date with any future patches that are released by Paradox for the game, so that there will always be a relatively stable version of the mod available for CK2. Finally, thanks to everyone who has played the mod, posted lets plays on YouTube and joined in with the community here over the past 7 years, it has really made it worthwhile :)",94,1246,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/dl6w49/crusader_kings_iii/,2019-10-22 01:02:08

As someone who is a lurker, reading everyone’s fantastical adventures, stories and lives and families has made the Game Of Thrones world so vast and amazing especially after I was so upset by the show that I don’t even want to re-watch it anymore but this subreddit has made me love the world even more nonetheless.

I hope this subreddit never dies and I don’t think it will because the geniuses behind the game and the mod allows for people to play as anyone from anywhere in my favourite fictional setting for however long they can. 

It’s hard to describe in words but this little corner of Reddit is one of my favourites and it just feels really important to me",32,390,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/co17na/this_might_get_removed_but_i_need_to_tell_you_all/,2019-08-09 15:42:32

160,9s7go5,"Mad King Taegon claimed the first night, so I killed everything he loved","I was happy. 

I had a beautiful wife to be, Olenna Hightower, she was attractive, gregarious, patient and honorable. A wife any real man would want and love. A wife to have a family with. 

The wedding was beautiful as I would imagine, I paid for the best and got the best. I spent so much money to have this wedding, I genuinely wanted it to go well! I invited the ENTIRE realm, and it being a time of peace. Everyone, and I mean everyone came. All of the Lord Paramount's were there, powerful lords and even the King himself. I thought it would be perfect. I was happy.

UNTIL HE RAPED HER! MAD KING TAEGON BLACKFYRE RAPED MY WIFE OLENNA HIGHTOWER, HE CLAIMED THE FIRST NIGHT, TOOK HER UP TO MY ROOM IN MY CASTLE! AND. RAPED. HER. 

I was Davos of house Stormborn, third of his name, Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and the fucking steward of the Seven Kingdoms. Do you know what a pissed off, no.. AN INFURIATED Lord Paramount Steward can do to your kingdom? 


As true to the words of my house, Thunder and Lightning I came down upon the house Blackfyre like the wrath of the Storm God. I rebelled against the Mad King Taegon with good men at my side. House Hightower, Stark, Arryn, Martel, Castamere and various other crownland lords rebelled. 


I killed Taegon. His family. And I disbanded the Seven Kingdoms.


When the Black dragon stole the highest tower..

They dared to support THREE plots to murder me. AND THEY SUCCEEDED IN MURDERING ME THRICE I TELL YOU. THRICE. I DIED THREE TIMES FOR THEIR DAMNED STUPIDITY. Not only this, but two of the people they murdered were GENIUSES. I had a good plan and everything, it was all going to be all fucking right. but no. Let's kill our lord, our other lord, and our lady! 

Then they dared rebel to place a distant uncle on my seat of Seagard, and The Crossing (fuck the freys. the twins are mine) 
I succeeded as I was not spending money for a few years so that I may upgrade my castle, and damn did that work out in my favour. Mercenaries, and everything. Destroyed their armies and then I sieged down their castle of some fuckin Melted tower or some shit like that. I imprisoned over 15 people in that siege. I, THE 10 YEAR OLD LADY OF SEAGARD.  And then, I executed their lord and kept the others imprisoned. you know, to make sure they didn't fucking rebel again. 

But they don't listen. They rebelled again! They plotted against me, I tell you! It was a fucking plan! They were going to kill me then take my lands, and kill my fucking family but  I DID THAT TO THEM FIRST. There were once around 20 charlestons. Now there be 10. And 3 of them imprisoned, so they may know once again. Their damned rebellion had its price

As much as it pained me, I couldn't help but become curious about having a game that followed the continuity of Game of Thrones. Starting in the ""A Feast for Crows"" bookmark, I console commanded the game to match what happened in the show, all the way up to Bran the Broken. This is what happened afterwards.

With Bran king, I went into observe mode, sped it up and left the room to go make a sandwich. By the time I had returned, I couldn't help but laugh when I saw that the sigil over King's Landing had gone from a direwolf to a lion. Three years into Bran's reign, he and Tyrion were assassinated by the remnants of House Lannister in the westerlands. **King Tywald Lannister**, also known as Tywald the Wicked, was elected as the ruler of Westeros.

He ruled for six years until his death, which resulted in a new monarch being elected: **King Davos Seaworth**. I don't know how. I guess he got popular during his time as Master of Ships. Apparently, his family became even *more* popular since, when King Davos died of old age, the realm elected his eldest living son. And so, Davos was succeeded by **King Stannis of the Iron Throne**. Pleased, I kind of tuned out while the game progressed and eventually stopped it altogether, but I know that after King Stannis died, the next ruler of Westeros was *another* member of House Seaworth. Again, this new king was elected. So that's that. Looks like House Seaworth won the game of thrones in the end.",38,324,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/chk2fd/what_happened_after_the_tv_show/,2019-07-25 10:36:00

367,bc8bbm,"Cerelle, aka How to Get a Lannister on the Iron Throne without incest","This was probably my most impressive intrigue game ever. Historically Cerelle Lannister was the first and only Lady Paramount of the Westerlands, becoming Lady of Casterly Rock at only three years old during the reign of Aerys I. She mysteriously died only a few months into her reign, and it is widely believed she was murdered by her uncle Gerold so he could take her titles, but this was never proven. I decided to play her and make her someone worthy of the name Lannister. At only three years old she had a long regency ahead of her. However, as a result of me sitting on my ass for 13 years not doing anything, I was stupid rich by the time she came of age.

Cerelle also turned out with an excellent intrigue education, 22 overall. Almost as soon as she turned 16, Aerys appointed her to serve on the small council as spymaster. I decided that I wanted to become Regent, and the first step in that was to murder Aerys. Since I had so much money I could bribe pretty much whomever I wanted, and his death went off without a hitch, and his brother, the insane Rhaegal Targaryen was crowned. I immediately went forward on trying to have Rhaegal declared incapable, and I was appointed Regent in short order. Only six months prior had Cerelle arrived in King’s Landing.

A few years passed, as I indulged myself to the “perks” that come with being Regent of the most powerful Kingdom in the world. Then the Blackfyres attacked. Since Rhaegal was pretty much universally hated, a large amount of people committed their banners to the Blackfyres. Not wanting to give up my place in court, I sided with the Targaryens, and eventually the Blackfyres were beaten back, but it was an extremely costly war. In the aftermath of the war Rhaegal was only able to muster 40k soldiers, but if I called my banners I could raise 30k. You know what that means, time to start fabricating a claim.

I got my claim in short order, and since I was Regent I had the ability to launch a coup. In a bloodless overthrow, Rhaegal Targaryen was ousted, and I was crowned Cerelle of the House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and The First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm.

When I conquered Vahar and awarded it to my youngest trueborn son, Roderick started bitching that it should have been *his.* I arranged him a matrilineal marriage with a Stark that, frankly, was way too good for him. Before they could even have any kids, his wife died of ""suspicious circumstances"" and he showed up in my court again, demanding that I award Gogossos to his fat ass. I finally built a new city holding on Gogossos and awarded it to him, in the hope that maybe there will be another Red Death outbreak, and he'll die screaming.

I go 3-4 years into the game and suddenly when I go to check Winterfell or Lannisport, I see that they have new rulers and all the main characters from the books have died off or been exiled.

If we got informed of these kind of events, it would really help us perceive the ongoing story because its too much work to keep track of everything around you at all times.

Currently, the game only informs us if it concerns the current Ruler of the iron throne or my Warden.

I took Cersei as my salt wife, and basically killed every Lannister, except for Kingsguard Jaime, and also Lancel. Recently, while I was away leading troops, Cersei got pregnant, and gave birth to an inbred, blonde child.

456,c5oo58,Is Aurane Waters (Valaryon) the most fun character to play?,"In the final bookmark, he starts off as the King of the Stepstones, but only controls half of them, with a very easy time picking off the remaining ones one-by-one within a year. As a Pirate, he can declare war on anyone and seize any coastal duchy, he can take plenty of concubines and impregnate prisoners as often as he wishes, he starts off with a level 3 warship, he has easy access to a Valyrian steel sword (Poison - in Bloodstone, can take it in only a matter of months), he's High Valyrian which gives him a much easier time taming dragons (and the Blood of Old Valyria perk), he has very good stats and traits, he's very young, he can legitimize himself day one, etc. Oh, and if you want quick money, you can sell off your slaves for 800 gold immediately as the game starts. The game later gives him a level 2 warship and a level 1 warship (Cersei's dromonds from the books). If you only keep the level 3 one, you can give the level 2 and level 1 ones away for relationship bonuses to people you want to like you... like your wife, especially if you forced her to marry you. Which you probably did. Because you're a pirate.

While most powerful characters are more-or-less limited in where they can go in the beginning of the game, he has literally dozens of options... among the ones I've enjoyed:

* converting to Faith of the Seven and marrying Dany (because she, like anyone from a legitimate religion refuses to marry a pirate)
* going R'hllor by using your claim on Driftmark and then taming one of Dany's dragons so that he can Dragon Conquer kingdom tiers. I mean, he can do it without R'hllor, but it's more fun.
* invading Dorne to force marry Arienne Martell and then conquer the kingdom in her name
* Invading the Iron Isles to steal Euron's valyrian steel armor and force marry Asha Greyjoy... oh, and there's two more Valyrian steel swords there.
* conquering the Three Sisters to reestablish the Kingdom of the Sisters and the Lady of the Waves religion (which is like pirate religion on steroids)
* conquering Dorne, Tyrosh and Lys and creating a new ""Empire of the Arm of Dorne"" to rival the Seven Kingdoms (On that note, conquering the duchy of Tyrosh is very alluring as it's capital is one of the best provinces in the game, takes 20,000 men to siege, provides 10k manpower, a lot of income and 300 ships)
* Since you have loads of money through slavery and capturing people, you can easily raise the 300 to hire the Golden Company for your more important wars. I like that option over the typical ""Valyrian = dragon rider"" cliche.",49,207,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/c5oo58/is_aurane_waters_valaryon_the_most_fun_character/,2019-06-26 15:27:50
