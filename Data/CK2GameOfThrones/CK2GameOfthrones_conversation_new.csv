0,"This is absolutely terrifying, I wonder what he'd do with it? Having a dragon like this seems like it'd paint a giant target on his back and not really be his style, but then again it is a LOT of power",How?,This is what Lysa Arryn sees in her fever dreams.,The best timeline,This is Tywin's ultimate middle finger to Aerys II,Grabs Weirwood arrows,"I think he'd be something like a more intimidating version of Jahearys I. Wouldn't go ape shit with his dragon, but wouldn't hesitate to use it, either","He already has a reputation as someone not afraid to use his power to make an example out of someone. Which is exactly what he did to houses Castamere and Reyne. Most people would be shitting themselves (the brown kind, not gold) even more than usual around him.","> This is absolutely terrifying, I wonder what he'd do with it?

He'd die 1 year later from old age/poor health",I’m guessing he lost the widowed trait and married Dany? From there she must have given him a dragon.,"Every single time I play, Lannisters have two bloodlines: Lann the Clever's and Aenar Targaryen's. It's probably a bug, but I've faced a similar situation as well, when Cersei somehow tamed Rhaegal (Euron got killed and Rhaegal flew to Casterly Rock or something) and fought against Daenerys (I was playing as Dany) as an ally of Tommen who occupied the Iron Throne.",We're gonna need a bigger bow,"Just House Reyne, there was no House Castamere, they were House Reyne of Castamere. That is why the song is the Rains of Castamere.","Bow??

While House Tarbeck was an integral part of the revolt, the song is entirely about the Reynes of Castamere, not the Tarbecks.","Wish Tarbeck got their own song too, but it just isn't as catchy to sing about as the Reynes","I'm not talking about the song. The first guy said house reyne and castamere when he said about Tywin using his power. You said that was only reyne, and I said that house Tarbeck was the other house that he probably was trying to say.","Ah, okay, did not get that from your previous comment.","Foolish move... Trust nobody, not even yourself.","I went on a tour of the realm and decided to pay the High Septon a visit. During the feast, I met myself and we became close friends.","Maybe he'll stop brooding so much

Then again he probably sat muttering shes ma queen into his drink","R5: Wrapped up a war when someone rebelled against me. Immediately after it was over, my Kingsguard declared war on me, imprisoned me, and won the war in about 30 seconds. Then I was released and back on the Throne.

&#x200B;

Ok then.",He was just asserting his dominance.,Criston Cole proceeds as usual. If you do not feed him to Syrax immediately after winning as Rhaenyra you are playing it wrong.,"You see, it's to do with some obscure variation of the law that a queen has to be kept in check by her queensguard... I guess.

Or maybe not...","His head seems to feel uncomfortable on his shoulders, I believe a spike might be a better solution",Such a mad lad,\#CritonColedidnothingwrong,Based and Greenpilled,Who is his betrothed?,How do you get the combined Baratheon-Lannister dynasty?,"Son of Tommen, and Margaery","Strong, quick, skilled fighter, and still less than 20 martial. Even in competency, Mace falls short of the mark",I was pretty sure it wasn’t possible to have three congenital traits?,I’m pretty sure it was myrcellas daughter,If you start as Joffrey in tWot5k it gives you the choice,"Tell that to the mountain.

Damn, I'd love to create hybrid dynasties in game. =/ Ironically, joffrey has only one bloodline and he gets to create the hybrid dynasty. haha","Other than dev-created characters. My point is that you can’t get three naturally in the game, two is the max.","You have to wait for CKIII, since it will finally feature cadet branches","> Ironically, joffrey has only one bloodline and he gets to create the hybrid dynasty. haha

And given what AI Margaery tends to be like in this mod, there's a good chance that this guy here is no more a Lannister than he is a Baratheon.",I’ve achieved it when I turned up the percentage chance.,"I mean technically you can assign cadet dynasties to bastards already if you are the head and the sole survivor of a particular dynasty but the hybrid dynasty thing is more intriguing to me.

Also, CK3 is set to release in 2020.

Euron taking the Reach kept them out of my invasion which helped immensely.  Looking over the Ironborn it seems that Victarion blew the Dragon horn and stole Rhaegal for Euron, dying in the process.  Euron then went on to solidify the Reach by making a Ironborn the LP and many High Lords of the Reach.  This was followed by an invasion of the North under a Rhllor Rickon.

Now I do have Viserion but he pales compared to Euron so I may have to wait for him to die to realistically survive this.  His heir won't be able to tame a dragon afterall.

Before that though, I'm gonna test out invading the Ironborn while Euron is still alive since its more fun.","You get a good look at a possible way the books will go.  Euron will be major in the books.  With the way the books have been written,  there is definitely a place for a potential ""NK"" level threat out of Euron.

I’ve only started 1 save so far with Robb in ACOK, and I basically fought off the Ironborn and Lannisters and ended the war, granting me independence.

If I wanted to conquer new land, how would I do that?",">  This was followed by an invasion of the North under a Rhllor Rickon.

This is hilarious.","You can use your Master of Laws to fabricate a claim on a title, most of the time only on a single province but sometimes (rarely) they can claim a high lordship, kingdom or even Empire in your name.  Thus far I've only seen the AI successfully fabricate a claim on the Iron Throne but it should be possible for human players.

You can also gain a claim by marrying one of the first born daughters of a title you want so a grandchild in the future has a claim too it.  Like how the Baratheon got picked to be the new kings in Lore.

You can also invite someone with a claim and press it against an enemy.  If you win that person gains the title and becomes your vassal.  An example would be if Cersei was ruling the Westerlands and you managed to get Tyrion to join your court, you can do a Northern War vs the Westerlands to overthrow Cersei and put Tyrion on the Westerland throne, who'd then become your vassal.

Finally you can tame a dragon an force vassalize the world with the Dragon Conquest CB.","Thanks, that was very helpful!

While the marriage is obviously different in the books, he's still trying to pawn her off into the marriage most beneficial to Littlefinger's future interests, and leading towards the North.

Become the King Beyond the Wall and Conquer the Nights Watch and eventually the Iron Throne.","REBUILDING HARRENHALL



yes it is possible it will take you more than 200 years it, it took me 5 rulers just to rebuilt the first tower but it was THE most fun playthrough I ever had in this mod ok here is how i did it:


- War of the Ninepenny Kings Start Date 
- House Whent
- marry every dynasty member as soon as you can it doesn't matter who other lords don't want to marry you anyway cuz ""unlikely to have children""
- matrilineal marriage every female member
- every single character NEEDS to have intrigue education
- pick intrigue focus  is the only one you'll ever need
- go nuts be the TRUE ruler of the riverlands, Rule the world at the center of everything while everybody is looking at someone else
- become spymaster, become regent of the lord make the lordparamurd your bitch, he doesn't like you? kill him, did the vale conquered the riverland? why these people always hiding in the mountains think they can control the river... OUR river, plot to replace spymaster with such high intrigue you will almost always succeed, kidnap him try to keep a tully as lord as lord paramurd or maybe some other house  is he losing a war use your own tropes to help him he is useful to us as long as we are in control
- but... what about the money? it cost a lot.. to rebuilt the towers and... my child... stop picking business focus you will have huge piles of cash doing this
- find someone with a lot of cash with no land and invite him to your court spy on them wait for the event and accuse them of treason
- use your military advisor to suppress revolt in your capital
- imprison the poor bastard, banish and take his/her cash
- repeat
- there are courtiers with 50 150 even 500 gold for no reason, and yes you will have to search the entire list but you will almost always find someone with 40 to 100 gold
- and the last thing take every event that speeds up the rebuilding sacrifice people, use your prisoners usually people who marry without your consent, give 200 gold to your master of coin if he ask for money and he needs to have 20+ at minimum and make him oversee the rebuilding 100% of the time.

This bug is fixed in the unofficial bug fixes version of the mod. http://agotcitadel.boards.net/thread/3389/agot-2-bugfixes-collection-unofficial","""My love, this farce really must come to an end. No woman bears a child for this long - not even aided by sorcery. You're not with child, you've gotten fat.""","It's the second time today I notice this. The previous one was my own character in another run so I had time to notice it's been way too long.

Do you know how to end this without remove\_trait ? I'd like to roll a child from this genius lass",There were at least 2 rushes of terror,"Oh I thought she would birth another child, I'm kinda disappointed now. Thanks for the bugfix",Or it's a way to justify random tantrums as being pregnancy hormone shenanigans,Three :),I think you are using an interface incompatible with AGOT,"But I played it A LOT already, now I came back to it after a little time away, and it looks like this. A lot of the windows, actually: the marriage one, the levies one, etc., but not all of them. What can I do?",Granted that pretty much all count-families go back hundreds of years i always turn off the option. There are more lore-friendly ways like landing a character with a claim on a title below your status and pressing the claim,"I do like that they have sort of balanced it with allowing the original owner to keep it as your vassal in certain situations. Letting them keep it is obviously the “good” thing to do while keeping yourself is framed as “bad”. 

That said, Is there really no circumstance where you could see it being lore friendly? Just spitballing, but take for instance a situation where someone is granted land for supporting the winning side, perhaps the neighboring lord feels he had more right to the land then this outsider. Maybe the ousted ruler and this lord share some loose heritage or perhaps - ala William the Conqueror - the ousted ruler had named this lord his heir in some fashion at some point. We have no idea what the fabricated claim is actually claiming. Maybe it is just strong case against them for being unfit to the rule and of course it’s settle in battle in the end.

In other words, I think it can be bent to fit with a bit of imagination. And as noted, without it the game can get boring.","It can be lore friendly, depends on how you rp it. Maybe your great ancestor owned the land until it was unjustly taken by a neighboring lord. Maybe your great great grandmother was the true born daughter of a previous lord who had no sons, giving you a more direct blood claim than the current lords","I'm also going to say not lore friendly.
Personally I play with fabricating claims off.
 
The only way land changes ownership when I play is through revocation or grants from a liege or marrying into a family to gain claims or assassinate the rest of said other family so that my family inherits.

I readily admit this is a much slower way of playing but I enjoy playing the long game that takes place over generations for my plans to be complete. It also makes me focus much more on diplomacy and intrigue which I think fits the setting more than just painting the map like I would in vanilla CK2 through endless fabrications, wars, and invasions.",I only fabricate for foreign lands like when I want to take Tyrosh as a replacement for Dragonstone.  Might just turn it off next time though since Expand Realm by Conquest can be done instead or Liberation wars if you're anti-slaver.,"I’ve thought about this before as well.  Ultimately, no it is not lore friendly.  However, it seems to result in a much more boring game with the rule disabled.


For the record, I play with it enabled.",So guys me and my friend have decided we will allow claim fabrication but we will set it to slower claim fabrication,"Back in the medieval days other kingdoms wouldn't waste time and just directly take your shit.

It should be something like C:\Username\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings 2\mod\A Game Of Thrones.

Then inside the common\events folder there should be a file called dragon_events.txt. Make sure to make a backup of this file before messing with it. Open that up and you'll have to find the events for dragon taming that you want to modify. Then you can comment lines out using # or remove them all together. You could also change the modifiers so that instead of the strong trait giving a 2x chance to tame dragons you could just make it a 100x chance.","the long night comes, monstrous ice creatures come with command of the dead to wipe out out all living things, and your biggest priority is your trade-posts??","lol, the game will get very boring if you let the walkers win.

>Also can the white walkers get to the Arbor? Or the Iron Islands?


I do believe they now have this ability (seem to recall it mentioned in some previous patchnotes), although I've never witnessed it myself.","Yes is the short version.

The long version is that I am playing as an Ironborn, which are nearly universally hated by the mainlanders for having a different culture and religion.

The even longer version is that I've pissed off the Iron Throne by kidnapping Myrcella and taking her for a salt wife, I've pissed off the Tyrells by kidnapping Margaery, the Vale and the north by kidnapping Sansa, the stormlands by taking Shireen, and so on.

The only reason they haven't declared a war of bloody vengeance (Blood Vengeance casus belli) on me and rekt my shit is because the white walkers are covering for me. I thought I was safe on my island, so I decided on a quid pro quo strategy. They would distract the armies of the lords I was raiding, forcing troops to the front-lines in the north while I raided in the south and killed any reinforcing armies heading north.

Everyone wins, besides my enemies :)

If the white walkers think they can fuck with my wallet though, I'm going to rethink my strategy. It's one thing to kill civilians and wipe out all the living on the mainland. I'll just go raid Essos in that case. It's another to take my gold :( We're going to have problems in that case.",they can i lost my last game as balon when the white walkers came and i joined robb stark they have ships and went to pyke and destroyed the iron islands,"Ah. Well that sucks. As to the game getting boring (shrug). If they didn't have boats, then if you look south, you can see a region called the Summer Islands, which is right near the Arbor, my capital. 

Also, Essos would be basically untouched, and as for the cost of building things during harsh winter, well I have a level 5 slave camp which shortens both time and money required, so they basically even out. I would have made trade posts in the Summer Islands and the  Iron Islands, and raided Essos for gold.

A moot point now though.",">Essos would be basically untouched

In order to avoid that happening I switched to my liege and waited for the decision to revoke royal privilege and chose to let my old character keep it, which granted me full legal rights to have it like Dorne, so it would be unlikely to have it be randomly revoked.

The above examples are the ones that survived, but some others that didn't quite last (like ""Hob"" or ""Dob,"" both also for Robert) survive as linguistic ""fossils"" in surnames like Hobson or Dobbins.",Mhysa is some valyrian dialect for mother,"wait, why the fuck would dany name a kid after one of the Usurper's staunchest supporters?","Ghiscari, I believe","Yeah I know, but I figured it as a sort of ode to his mommy",Because she's married to Jon and he's very persuasive (and she's just the Lady of Dragonstone vs his King of Westeros),I always name my first dragons Balerion Vhagar and Meraxes but,"Ah, fair enough",I always name mine Scaly Dog,"I had a Dragon hatched with the predetermined name Borax...We burned the realm clean.

Easiest way to accomplish this I figured (using More Bloodlines) was to attempt to merge the Umber, Crakehall, and Baratheon bloodlines into my existing Mormont house.

When I started this campaign, only \~50 years ago I would never have dreamed that I would end up with 4 quick generations of daughters in a row. They all each had daughters at 15 or 16 so now Jorah is only 75 and there are 5 generation of Mormonts still alive. All of them are strong/tall/brave skinchangers with their own personal bears/dogs/deer etc.

Mara (Jorah's first great-great-granddaughter) was just born with a martial score of 17 and a personal combat rating of 80 at 0 years old because of the strong/tall/brave traits + all her bloodlines. All the other daughters/granddaughters etc have martial scores between 25 and 45 and regularly win melees and tourneys all over the Seven Kingdoms.

I can't wait to see where else this ends up. Also if anyone else has any other suggestions for more obscure good bloodlines to try and get I'm happy to try and see what I can do.","Damn, I remember I was excited for having a son with 22 martial at age 14. You’re taking it to the next level","I've done something similar in my House Piper playthrough. I kept track of the Skinchangers, and found that House Farwynd managed to get the Great Warg bloodline, on top of the fact that they already have a ridiculously good bloodline for such a remote house.

At this point in time, I've managed to instill into the royal Piper bloodline the Farwynds, the Grey King of the Iron Isles, the Great Warg, House Stark's bloodlines, the Umber bloodline, the Durrandon Bloodlines, and just recently the Tyrell/Gardener bloodline. 

I highly recommend the Stark or Farwynd bloodlines to boost your chances of becoming skinchangers. There's usually one or two skinchanger bloodlines in all the regions aside from the North which has several. The Tyrell/Gardener bloodline is fantastic for boosting fertility so your house can potentially expand more.","More Bloodlines submod is arguably super OP compared to playing the base mod and is easy to take advantage of all the increased bloodlines. But I find it can lead to a lot more interesting stories and characters.

22 martial at 14 years old is not bad at all especially if you're not using More Bloodlines and just the base mod.",IS the best way to gather bloodlines by matrilineally marrying people from houses with the bloodline you want to pass down? That could be great in Dorne," Matrilineal marriage is the only way to permanently merge any other bloodlines into your dynasty and keep your heir as your dynasty at the same time. Usually if you end up with sons you need to go through some extra steps to get those bloodlines into your main branch of your dynasty. If you end up with daughters like I did then you can skip those extra steps and they get merged in immediately.

Quick explanation why Matrilineal is the best:

 1. Patrilineal bloodlines will ALWAYS pass down from the father

 2. Matrilineal bloodlines will ALWAYS pass down from the mother

 3. Patrilineal bloodlines will ONLY pass down from the mother if married Matrilineally 

 4. Matrilineal bloodlines will ALSO pass down from the father if married Matrilineally

As you can see in a Matrilineal marriage all Patrilineal and Matrilineal bloodlines from BOTH parents are inherited by their children. If the mother in this marriage is of your dynasty you now have successfully merged together all these bloodlines together.

You are right that this works great in Dorne, as well as for Targaryens since they can marry close relatives, and if just get lucky and end up with only daughters even if you have agnatic-cognatic succession.","In my random noble game Edmure is a horny fucker; he had a child with his sister Lysa(?????), is married to Nymeria Sand with 3 kids and now had a bastard son with a conehead who ended up in Riverrun somehow???",In my game he married “Cersei Lannister” but it wasn’t the Cersei you are thinking.,wtf are those bald neanderthals,"And Jesus, what a terrible name for a kid.

Which while technically ending house targaryen when Dany dies gives you both the Stark and Targaryen's bloodlines",I tried that but it said he has legitimized him and his line as Rightharts as opposed to Targaryens.,"Are you sure? For that's not what is supposed to happen:

\- Stannis' offer right at the start should give you the option to be legitimised (and due to a bug in the current version it results in you becoming a Righthart instead of a Stark)

\- Tower of Joy should make you realise who your real parents were and by claiming the Iron Throne angry every other claimants

\- After you've taken the Throne (or have become the independent King in the North / have your spouse sitting on the throne) the intrigue option should open a new event that makes you choose if you want to remain a Stark, be acknowledge as a Targaryen or found a new dinasty.

It's the third event the one that automatically changes your dinasty; the problem is, afaik, only with the second event since it requires you to be a legitimised Stark and be in the same province as Lord Reed (but due to the dinasty bug it doesn't work unless you fire it yourself)","Hmm so step 1 and 2 I definitely did. I took Winterfell and then I fired the Tower of Joy event, granting me a claim on the Seven Kingdoms and pissing off the other claimants. At that point I was a Righthart, and then I took the Iron Throne. I saw the intrigue option to legitimize my parentage, so I selected it and it said “Jon becomes legitimized as a member of the Righthart dynasty” and mentions nothing aboutTargaryen. I was still at war with fAegon when I legitimized my parentage so maybe that is the problem?","Yeah, it's the third one that's the problem. It should give you three options along the lines of ""I will claim my inheritance -> become a Targaryen"", ""I am and will always be a Stark -> remain a Stark"" and ""I'm a bit of both -> found the Stark-Targaryen dinasty"".

Seems to me you legitimized yourself with the standard option for a bastard who gets to rule an independent king, instead of the Jon specific one. Might be worth to try again and see if that still happens (or if you still have any option in the intrigue menu to try and correct it).

I'd argue that Jon, Dany, and Arya all had more interesting stories, maybe not quite as weird and wacky, but definitely more interesting, IMO.

Sure, it may be better than the ending of Season 8... but seriously, Season 8 isn't exactly a high bar to aim for...

I may be a little biased on this one, but I personally think that, at least for the show, an ending with Gendry and Arya ruling Westeros would've made the most sense when weighing up the merits of creating an ending that feels subversive and bittersweet (aka, fan-favourite Dany still dies) but still logical and meaningful, as well as being laced with an intense feeling of irony. It was also create an ending that makes sense given the internal laws and logic of Westeros and the motivations of the story's characters.

Subverting expectations doesn't have to be a bad thing. The show's popularity and notoriety was built on the likes of episodes such as Baelor, The Rains of Castamere, and The Mountain and the Viper. It was entirely possible to do the Dany's downfall right if the writers actually cared.","Yeah, it’s boring and predictable and too much in the spirit of a happy ending.

Jon and Dany, or just Jon becoming king might seem a little cliche to us now knowing what we know.  But **I think** it was always Martin's intention.  The analyzers and theoryists might have worked out R+L=J pretty early on, but I think he was happy with his writing not giving that away to the average readers too early on.    


I think we could all think of an ending we would prefer, all I know is I would rather the one that was a bit cliche and obvious, but at least logical and wholesome and conclusive than the random story we got.",Definitely not,I guess that Daenerys earning her throne and having a baby with Jon is good storytelling and having literally everything go her way is good storytelling? Instead of actually showing her Targaryen madness at full force?,"That’s not bittersweet. You know what’s bittersweet? A hero going crazy, a man being forced to kill is love and be exiled, a soldier seeing the person he cared for the most lose her head in front of him, a man who loved his sister no matter the conflicts they had with one another dying with her after being crushed, an abused and tormented woman finally proving herself to be a person deserving of respect, a girl finally letting go of her anger to go see the unknown world, a hard warrior killing the brother who abused him and overcoming his fear of fire, a former slaver who lived in a shameful exile finally redeeming himself by dying defending the woman he loved even though she didn’t love him, and a continent finally being returned to a state of peace due to the destruction of the very thing that caused all the chaos and death and war to begin with.

That makes for a bittersweet ending. Having Sandor, a SINGLE loved character, dying isn’t bittersweet at all. Having everyone alive and well with Jon going against his own beliefs to marry Daenerys and nobody the fans like dying isn’t bittersweet. It’s tropey and obvious fanservice.",event bastard.999 1002059,"Your bringing logic into S8

And also thought about it more than the writers",That's also a good point.,"Yeah, but the difference is George's writing versus D&D's.","The journey is more important than the destination

Again, my ideal ending is just my opinion and one of several different widely accepted ""better alternative endings"", and is also mainly in reference to fixing the stupidity of Bran becoming King rather than fixing the stupidity of how Dany's downfall was portrayed (which I also agree is a major problem with the ending).

I'm not from the camp of people who think that Dany and/or Jon needed to sit on the Iron Throne by the end of the story and think GRRM is somehow betraying them by ending their characters and their House similarly in the books. Like I said, I think the ending needed some sort of tragedy in order to feel genuine and sincere and in line with the story's narrative, and Dany's downfall and eventual death at the hands of her lover is the sort of stuff that Game of Thrones is known for. It could've been great if only her final character arc had been written and executed properly.","While I do think that GRRM always intended to do R+L=J (After all, D&D got their jobs for guessing the fan theory), I don't think that necessarily means that GRRM always intended for Jon to be King. GRRM did set out to write ASOIAF with the express intent of ""subverting the tropes of fantasy"" and for Jon to turn out to be a secret heir to the Throne and for that information to **not** lead to where everyone expects (Jon becomes King), rather it creates tension between Jon and Dany that ultimately boils over into Dany going mad fits this core theme of ASOIAF far better. Of course it needs to be far more developed, fleshed out, and you know... logical than the rushed mess of a character dive that we got in Season 8, and I honestly believe that GRRM will be able to do that in the books (I also think there will be other contributing factors leading to Daenerys' downfall in the books, such as fAegon).

And I do agree that after Season 8 we can all create an ending that we would prefer. The reason I gave my two cents was that I do believe the final season could've created a logical and satisfying plot twist as to who will sit on the Iron Throne, when we've all been expecting it to be Jon and/or Dany for years. I think that the fact that Season 8 is so terrible has let a lot of people to believe that any ending in which Dany doesn't go mad would've been a good ending, and I'm definitely not a fan of an ending in line with OP's CK2 game, but at the same time, I really, really can't blame you or anyone else for preferring this kind of ending over the train-wreck that was Season 8.","It's better than how the ending we got was presented at least, in my eyes. The rush to the finish ruined it IMO","Lol what an absurd strawman. I'm all about downer endings where shit goes wrong, but the execution is as important as the idea itself. I think the books are going to end in a similar way to the show, actually, and I think its gonna be awesome because the char developments will be sufficiently fleshed out, and Dany's spiral into villany is gonna be more than a lazy asspull in the second to last episode. Half-hearted ""foreshadowing"" is not character development.","Jaime would still be dead, Daenerys destroys the tower not knowing Jaime had already killed Cersei. His character was assassinated most egregiously. Jorah, Missandei, Lyanna, Theon would still all be dead. The ending would diverge when Daenerys rides to the tower.",Thanks.,"Yeah a lot I agree with here.  I personally found Dany's breaking point one of the saving graces of the season. That being said there was not enough prodding of her patience to warrant the mass murder, it ended up being like a woah, very premature.  And while there is the whole Madness Greatness coin flip with the targs, that just seemed still so far from the grain of her character.    


I like the idea of it not going as expected, Jon and or Dany not getting the throne, but Bran... I just cant really fathom that ending.  I can't see how George ever could have planned it, if anything, he was one of a very very short list of absolutely nots for me.","No, it’s not. It’s generic as hell.","Yeah, “half hearted” foreshadowing that’s already been done in the books. It sounds like you have more of a problem with George than D&D.

Would have been epic","That’s still not bittersweet, plus it would leave a huge plot hole with why Daenerys didn’t just go and burn the Red Keep she first went to Westeros.

The generic ending you want wasn’t ever going to happen in the show or the books. Daenerys and Jon were never going to rule together. And Westeros was never going to be united again. An ending like that was the very thing George wanted to avoid, as his whole goal was to not use a ton of tropes.

And stop with the Jaime killing Cersei thing. Why would Jaime kill Cersei and her baby when it’s obvious he loves her too much to do that?","No problem, hope it works","Unlike the entire last season's writing?

There's a reason it's almost universally hated by fans of the books and casuals.","Lol, S8 is universally hated for being rushed, predictable and nonsensical. I would take a generic ending than the shitstorm we got instead.",Dense,"Wrong. I did, from I first read CoK years back, come to expect that Daenerys was going to end up going all fire and blood on Westeros. The books are, I would say, very clearly leading up to this.

Really, thats what her whole arc is about; her having to make a choice between the ""good queen"" she wants to be, and the ""easy road"" of just burning shit to the ground, all the while every ""good"" choice she tries to make only leads to more misery. Conquering is easier than ruling fairly.

But rewatch the show, and tell me with a straight face that her turn turn to completely mindless mustache-twirling cartoon villainy is properly developed. I dare you. The show changed a whole lot from the books in its portrayal of her, from early on in the story. Yes, she kills people. Jon kills people. Brienne kills people. Arya straight up mass-murders *all the Freys.* Does that mean Arya was developing into a crazy, murderous lunatic who is going to massacre thousands of people for *literally no practical reason* other than nonsensical, vaguely defined ""madness""? Nah, you go girl, Arya is so badass!

Daenerys' whole story (up until they outpaced the source material) is *very clearly* framed in a heroic light by the series itself.

But to recap of course, poor military decisions during the Battle of Winterfell, not utilizing resources gained from Daenerys' freed slave cities to maintain her army and the North, cutting important scenes from the viewer like Jon explaining his heritage to his siblings, Arya returning to Winterfell and leaving it immediately barely acknowledging her family on the way out even though they're the reason she came back anyway, Bran crowned as king and having the best story ever despite doing jackshit these past 3 seasons, Euron Greyjoy somehow managing to ambush Daenerys despite her better vantage point in the sky with a very visible view of the sea and land, a terribly comedic skit meeting with the ""great lords"" of Westeros in the Dragon Pit deciding the future of the realm with the resounding vote being an ""Aye"", which is a Northern phrase so I'm wondering why most of the Southern lords did that instead of signing some sort of treaty, choosing the a Northerner as king of the realm while also agreeing the their king's sister is now the Queen of an independent North separate from the rest of them with barely a complaint...

It looks like your holding is on the border of Myr and Volantis. There is a supply bonus for controlling adjacent provinces. If the Myrish army is too big to march across Volantis to siege the capital without taking too much attrition it will try and besiege a path of provinces to the objective.

A lot of time the AI looks like it is besieging randomly but when you take into account supply limits it can make more sense.

Usually a war won't last long enough for the AI to complete a path of besieged provinces from their border to the objective so this can be hard to ever see.

If you want to attempt to play a game without being sieged in a war between larger powers you need to live in a province that isnt on the border or on an obvious path from a border towards the capital.

P.S. I am currently playing an awesome game as the Mormonts up on Bear Island. Its obviously an extreme example of an out of the way province. But the AI never bothers to siege it. They usually land armies around Wolfswood and White Harbor, and march up the Neck all trying to get to Winterfell. Bear Island never gets touched.

I feel like the AI prefer to siege you than going further to reach the objective most of the time","For over a decade Euron Greyjoy harried Westeros and the world at large with longship, dragon and fell magic.

It is hard to describe how twisted and evil Euron was. A wielder of profane magics, he reformed the faith of the Drowned God; Installing himself as a living god and teaching his priests some of his magical knowledge, while promoting the most bloodthirsty and cutthroat aspects of Ironborn society. 

Hundreds were drowned in magical rituals to fuel his spells. People were possessed or cursed with sickness and madness for sport.

Slavery was introduced to the Iron Isles and whole noble houses enslaved and sold- and thousands of small folk as well. 

Almost all the nobility of the Reach and the Riverlands was displaced over the years and replaced with fanatical and violent Ironborn. 

The only reason Euron doesn´t have more children is that he was far too busy raiding around the World with Rhaegal or had to put one scheming vassal after the other down. He was notorious for gathering magical artifacts and books of dragonlore, his pet project being the creation of mind controlled dragon riders. (Basically; Make a province with dragon intel your capital, build a dragonpit, give valyrians/members of your dynasty a dragon egg and books which increase the chance to hatch and tame dragons and then possess them.)

All the while he ignored the Wild Walkers, who keep the rest of Westeros busy in an endless War. Most of the North has fallen, the War for the Dawn a bitter stalemate. Thousands die in a frozen wasteland, protecting their homes and all living beings.. Unprotected homes and living beings which keep getting violated by the bloodthirsty and sorcerous ironborn.

And then; The great ravager, the vile sorcerer, the mad god, the first storm and the last died while giving in to his inner ramsay, his head smashed in by a poor peasant girl with a rock in some unnamed forest.

But, oh well. His son Vickon is definitely his fathers son and is happy to continue the legacy of the dragon riding sorcerer god.","well, he wouldn't be the first greyjoy to be slain by a no-name woman - Dalton the Red Kraken got his throat slit in his sleep by a salt wife.",I like how it uses the art for being gifted a hunting dog,"Nice, is this from the event about choosing to claim First Night rights on a peasant couple?",See this is why I kill them first...,Rewind time,">  in some unnamed forest.

The lands flourished, vassals were loyal, and dragons roamed the skies once more. But all things considered, his family had some of the spiciest drama:

* His Grandson Aegon, whose own death would have triggered a 2nd Dance of the Dragons, [threw himself at a Dragon and somehow won.](https://i.imgur.com/sO6v9t6.png)
* Baelor got himself [elected High Septon, living his dream](https://i.imgur.com/tggMJBe.png) for twenty years while serving as Daeron's loyal adviser.
* His daughter Vaera had multiple bastards and several affairs, indirectly caused her brothers death and [then had the *nerve* to ask me for a cool nickname] (https://i.imgur.com/R5WKmY1.png), so she was given an accurate one. She was such a problem that [Daeron bet her life in a game of chess](https://i.imgur.com/6vge5n6.png) with no remorse.
* King Daeron was so old that he [became best friends with his genius **great-great-grandson**](https://i.imgur.com/CTzidWR.png) (also named Daeron) who later [became a formidable fighter.](https://i.imgur.com/lsz75Av.png  )
* The only problem was that Daeron 2.0 was not the eventual heir, since his mother couldn't inherit because her dad Aegon the Dragonslayer already had a weak son. But for once the AI actually worked in my favor and [Jaekar tried to elope with his distant cousin](https://i.imgur.com/lYw2BKL.png), earning him a lifetime vacation to The Wall and making his sister Visenya heir. So now Daeron 2.0 will one day inherit as her eldest son, ending that threat of Aegon's death causing a war.
* But i guess being a burden is genetic, since [Vaera's daughter Vaena](https://i.imgur.com/ZPOd8bX.png) got embroiled in a trial by seven since she was caught sleeping around. This proved true to her burden heritage, since the ensuing trial by combat led to Lord Commander Lucerys killing his nephew Aelor, but most importantly Daeron's [beloved son Daemon would be struck down during the trial](https://i.imgur.com/lC1hzzP.png). And it gets even worse since Vaena's side won, so Daemon's death was 100% worthless.

This must have been too much grief for the 77-year old to handle, since he died peacefully in his bed less than a month after the trial :(  

And weirdly enough, the exact day he died Aegon had gotten an event about how old Daeron was. Which was a nice way to begin the reign of the Old Dragon's grandson and successor, [Aegon IV The Dragonslayer.](https://i.imgur.com/8MtSkYF.png)

*And* by checking opinion modifiers it was revealed that the reason Aegon's weak son Jaekar never got his trial by combat [because his own dad refused to champion for him.](https://i.imgur.com/fuA6cri.png)(I guess he liked his daughter better too!).",What sub mods you using?,Who'd you marry your sisters to?,"I had Daeron marry all three of them, he starts in a solid enough position to not need alliances/NAPs early on.

* Has a massive number of children (thanks visit chambers mod) so every other weekend there's some love affair or murder or adultery happening in the Expanded Targaryen family

Being the faithfull bodyguard of the main branch of the house that rose in place of the Martell a century ago, the lords or the Torrentine had to forsake their liege after a bloody offensive war to claim their inheritance right over the Reach (during a mega war) followed by a dreaded Great Sickness. The main branch of Dayne got deposed by a swarm of malcontent dornish lords then after the end of the plague Alyna retaliated leading to the execution of her kins and her taking back the throne that belongs to her house.

Now Princess of Dorne and lord protector of the Reach, Alyna sought to definitly crippled the damned Iron Throne the dornish people abhor since centuries. So she installed her vassal of house Lannister, highlord of  casterly Rock onto the Westerlands throne they lost two generations ago.

The Iron Throne will probably lose the Iron Islands soon and will be reduced to the Crownland and the Stormland. Quite pathetic.

Some kings being pretty good, one being a hated tyrant, most being lustful and spreading their seed as widely as possible. 

One however, had only had trueborn daughters and bastard sons, which led to my current character, the Eternal Queen Morya Piper. I had smartly married a character with Farwynd bloodline, to bring all that sweet benefits into the royal dynasty. Bonus points, I then married my heir to a branch of the Piper dynasty that I had bred the Durrandon bloodline into beforehand. 

House Piper's future looks bright as all get out with these awesome bloodlines. 

But then I had a odd event chain, which led my character down the rabbithole of gaining immortality for herself ~~like Queen Elizabeth~~ and having a immortal bloodline. At first, I was ecstatic. 

Now though, I realize she'll live a long ass time, and getting to play as my heirs with their awesome skinchanger abilities seems like a distant memory, since it appears Queen Morya just won't and can't die.

Also RE fertility and immortality, my Hindu character in a vanilla game got immortality and took his mentor as a concubine. So both he and she were having children well past 100. When immortal age isn't the factor they'll just keep knocking out kids if the woman got immortality before 45.","She can only die violently.  She can be murdered, die in battle or be executed.  Any woman who becomes immortal before turning 45 can have children forever.",Prince Charles can relate. Queen Elizabeth won't die before he becomes king.,"I mean, I would think about suicide or abdicating, but even though my heir has better and more fun traits than Morya, none of their stats come close to hers yet.

After some time, I manage to conquer enough with the power of like 3-4 regions that paid me homage to establish the Iron Throne. Huzzah.

After a few generations of tactical marriages, I have managed to establish a really powerful empire, even managing to install a branch family of House Piper as the Kings of New Ghis. 

To my surprise, I got a notification about my dynasty becoming the traditional overlords of a region, which I was like, oh cool. Maybe the branch of the family I installed as Lord Paramount of the Iron Isles has become accepted as the traditional rulers and the Hoare's have finally lost their own traditional claim over the Iron Isles.

But nope. Somehow, some way, a branch of the family that I had disinherited long ago due to some fuckery by one of their ancestors, continued to live on till one of their members apparently joined the Nightswatch, took it over, and made it into a god damn Kingdom.

Jon was born twenty-odd years before the Conquest, the second son of the old Lord Mooton. Ever since he was old enough to understand he was never going to inherit anything, he resented his brother with all his heart, but remained unable to challenge him due to his personal code of honor. All that changed rather abruptly when a certain Aegon Targaryen landed in the Blackwater Rush and promptly incinerated the man between Jon and his ambitions. Grateful to the King for doing his dirty work for him, he joined the Conqueror in his quest to unite the Seven Kingdoms under one banner. Perhaps his most notable achievement in his early life was leading Aegon's ground troops during the infamous Field of Fire - while his liege soared in the sky with his sisters, Jon had to keep his men from panicking from the dragonfire and the immense numerical disadvantage. Little did he know that his life had not even come close to peaking that day...

In fact, all this happened before I even started playing as him! Jon Mooton is actually a minor historical figure. My game started in the year 8000 (1 AC), shortly after Aegon won his throne.

The Mootons were a small family with a proud history, serving as bannermen to the Harroways. Jon carved his way through his fellow vassals and supplanted Harroway quickly enough, and moved on to trying to expand his influence by fighting the Brackens. Around that time he fathered Florian, his first and only child - a genius, and the light of his life.

Lord Samwell, son and heir of Edmyn Tully, did not like the expansion one bit, and when Jon tried to claim Stone Hedge, the Lord Paramount called for a stop to the war.

After Jon refused to stand down, he was branded a traitor and imprisoned, but fought his way out via trial by combat - this would later become something of a pasttime of his. The Brackens would later be finished off in a final and decisive war, with Jon slaying Lord Bracken personally.

Whenever Tully tried to revoke a title from him, Mooton entered a war and immediately surrendered, after which he'd fight his way out. One time, however, that didn't work, and he got thrown in the oubliette... an event that would change him forever.

When Lord Samwell decided Jon had had enough, the man was released - however, his stay in the darkest pits of Riverrun scarred his psyche forever. After he learned that one of his bannermen was trying to murder his son, he flew into a frenzy and **FUCKING ATE THE GUY.** Thus began his descent into madness.

Jon had vowed that he would outlive his liege lord, and he delivered on his promise - threefold, in fact. Lord Samwell tried to rise against Aegon, so Jon sided with the kind and kicked his ass - Tully was promptly executed. The late lord's son tried to revoke a title from him, so he rose in rebellion and killed his liege in single combat. Samwell's brother came to power, and promptly died of cancer.

At some point Jon also travelled to Valyria with his faithful friend Fashbinder, and came back with a suit of Valyrian Steel armor.

He also conquered and eventually restored the castle of Harrenhal, making it his seat and earning himself a place in legend. And when he ran out of ambition and got bored of conquest, the man **JOINED THE CITADEL.**

Over the next twenty years, Jon the Gallant earned himself a respected place among the Maesters, eventually finishing a Great Work on tactics. However, the Maesters were also the eventual reason for his death.

When he went to the Citadel to forge his Peoples and Cultures link, he was offered a lucrative opportunity - travel instead of study. Being a brave and rather impatient man, he gladly accepted... and was faced with a bug.

Before him stood an event, asking him where he would like to travel - but his only option was ""cancel"". Thinking it'd cancel the whole event chain, I pressed it... and promptly got myself softlocked.

I like to think Jon the Gallant just vanished into thin air one day, and turned up dead ten years later. Having outlived two kings and become an in-law to a third, having thwarted all his rivals, having proven to the Maesters that wisdom does not equal servitude, he became a true legend, seemingly unkillable... So the game took a stab at it.

RIP, my man.

TL;DR: got imprisoned, went mad, ate someone, rebuilt harrenhal, outlived all his rivals and died to a bug","In all my playthroughs (Especially from minor count/duke to Emperor) there's always that one breakthrough character that exceeds every expectation you had of them (Often with no postitive birth traits) and sets up your dynasty for the following generations.

Think about it.  If they were just going to break the rules of the Watch for Samwell, don't you think he should be LP of the Reach?  

Characters are greater when you don't assign completely out of character things to them... don't forget, in the show's idiocy, Jaime promised LP of the Reach to Sam's father for his help against Highgarden.  Since we are apparently just releasing everyone from their vows, and not only that, appointing Grand Maesters who aren't even graduated Maesters yet, don't you think maybe we could have gotten Sam's birthright to him?

Sam is honestly the worst ending.  Says essentially nothing to stand up for his best friend, doesn't nominate him as the TRUE KING for killing the woman who killed millions by fire, including his own father and brother, all because freaking Yara is on the rag?

Sam should have had it. He got dun dirty.,"u/Corrin_Toast essentially got right to the heart of it.  Not only with subverting expectations, but they did FAR too much fan service.  

We all know where Bronn ends in the books -- but for the show, due to illness striking down the actor who played Ser Ilyn Payne, they had Bronn do Jaime Lannister's training after losing his hand, accompanies him to Dorne, etc.

Jon and Dany go to parley with Cersei at the Dragonpit, and they brought a wight that they captured beyond the Wall to show Cersei that the Walker threat is real.  

Bronn trains Jaime, did everything he ever did for Tyrion, did everything he ever did for Cersei, and no one is paying off his castle.  Finally, Cersei (offscreen, of course, Lena Headey and Jerome Flynn had it in their contracts that they would never appear together because they used to fuck in real life...) sends Bronn after both Jaime and Tyrion (Jaime splits to go fight for the living against the Walkers.)

They defeat the Walkers, and Jaime and Tyrion are talking about how Jaime fucked Brienne, alone in a tavern like spot... Bronn walks in with Joffrey's crossbow and says Cersei offered him Riverrun to take them out.  He socks Tyrion and Tyrion reminds him of the whole ""if someone pays you to kill me, I'll double it..."" and Bronn asks...

""What is double Riverrun?""

Highgarden.

So, even though Bran has never even met Bronn by the end of the season, he is made Lord Paramount of the Reach AND they make the man who literally doesn't understand loaning money the Master of Coin.

-----

Why did they do this?  Because Jerome Flynn's Q-Rating as Bronn was off the charts.  Everyone loved Bronn, so they got more Bronn.

What makes the entire ending truly pathetic is that this isn't even close to the dumbest thing they did.  Not. Even. Close.

(Sorry to anyone who hadn't seen the ending yet, but it has been six months, and this was vital to discussion.  You can downvote me if you wish, I understand.)","Gotta ""Subvert the audience's expectations"" as they said.

They were more preoccupied with doing something that would surprise the viewers of the show than something that's actually good and that makes sense","It's show only invention of Cersei, which were retained by Daenerys and Bran.

Not only that, but they never show you Gilly again, either... Sam's just Grand Maester and he's just peachy with everything that occurred.

He has these powers, right?  

Why did he tell Jon his parentage?  All it did was fuck everything up.

He knew Dany would burn Kings Landing -- did nothing.

Knew Euron was waiting to kill Rhaegal -- did nothing.

But the dumbest?  It's a tie between Euron washing up on the exact same beach as Jaime...losing the fight, and breaking the fourth wall to say ""I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister..."" --- and ""The new King just gave up his ancestral seat, so he has absolutely zero loyal force, and his sister would overrun the Iron Throne, and Sansa would be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms in short order.""

Not only does he give up his ancestral seat, but he gives the ENTIRE NORTH AWAY?  And Dorne and the Iron Islands say sweet fuck all?  It all just rings so false, but those are probably the two dumbest...

Bran's reign would be crazy short as he has no loyal forces, and why in the world would someone so tied to the North rule the South?  Why can't he instantly locate Drogon?  Why couldn't he just tell Arya what is west of Westeros?

Honestly, I could probably write for several days on it.  The fact that Bran is not shown to be the pawn of the Children, and essentially evil, killed it.  He's getting his revenge for the Children, it is VERY obvious...","See, you essentially got into the show right as the book content ended, for the most part.  Jon Snow is currently dead, as far as the books.  His last word was ""Ghost"" and most of us assume that warging into Ghost is how he will survive, but who knows if we will find out.  

I mean, I won't say it isn't worth watching, but you can feel the drop in quality once GRRM's written content was done.","100%

I’m sorta upset that *this* was how that was presented to the world. Dany going from the beggar king’s controlled and berated sister to Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains to The Mad Queen who burned down King’s Landing is a remarkable transformation that is tied up with lineage, honor, her perceived birthright, and the limits of one’s mental ability to cope. In the books, something is going to happen to make her lose it and that’ll probably be Aegon taking the throne and bringing some sort of peace to his part of Westeros before Dany even arrives on the shore. All she did was for nothing and that, with an appropriate amount of stress and perhaps at the end of a brutal military campaign, is enough to make her burn down the city.

Wish we got that well written in a book first, but oh well, it’s at least slightly contenting to know how everything’s roughly going to go.","I had to add...

The story essentially starts with a King who doesn't give a shit about ruling as King of Westeros... and it ends with a King who doesn't give a shit about ruling as King of Westeros.

You see it at the Small Council.  He wants a Master of War, Whisperers, and Laws, so he can ""look for Drogon"" and then completely absent himself.

He's Robert without the wine.  What kind of ending is that?","I have no idea what you’re on about with this ‘pawn of the Children’ thing, but I just want to say that Euron didn’t break the fourth wall. He said something aloud to himself, he didn’t direct it at the audience.","Yeah I kings noticed that. After season 5, it was a change in writing and story all together, when I binged 1-4 2 weeks before 5 came out","We can agree to disagree on the fourth wall.

As far as Pawn of the Children, the only way the King Bran tale actually works with what happened is if he is evil.  Who helped him at Bloodraven's cave?  The Children.  Why?  Because he was all that mattered.

Why?  Name one thing Bran does that is actually GOOD for anyone living.

He could see the past, present, and future.

He says ""Tell Jon the truth."" Why?  All it did was cause the deaths of the citizens of Kings Landing.  Bran knows Jon is never to be King, so why tell him, except to foment the dissent between Jon and Dany so she scours KL.

He sees Euron's position...doesn't warn Dany, even though it costs her Rhaegal (which he also sees...) and her bestie in Missandei.  

Is Bran being King actually good for Westeros?  The story starts with a drunk who doesn't care about ruling, and ends with a cripple who doesn't care about ruling -- AND it also splits in into six and one AND leaves Westeros with a King without a ancestral seat.(and thus any troops.)

Literally the only people that ending is good for are the Small Council members (no one of real value to the Kingdoms, mind you) and Sansa.  Everyone else's end is awful.

Who benefits from the fact that Westeros just got massively screwed, and that Bran could have stopped the Scouring of KL at any time?  

Those who wanted revenge -- the Children of the Forest.  The same people who were surrounding and working for the last Raven, and gave the lives there for Bran at the Cave.  Why?  What benefit is any of that to the Children?

They want their revenge, that's what... and what better way than to destroy a million humans, split their Kingdoms, and ruin royal succession by putting their leader (the Raven) on the Throne.

When you actually analyze the way the ending goes down, it isn't a good ending for anyone really...except for those that wanted revenge.

Steffon eventually died, & his son Selwyn became king. Kermit was made an advisor on the small council & had a daughter before dying of stress. Selwyn became the child's guardian, & vowed that House Blandish would be rewarded with land. He began a conquest of the Stepstones, granting the girl one of the islands, & eventually she or her son will be given the title of Lord Paramount.

Also a Lord Commander of my Kingsguard, Paul ""the Hunter"", a lowborn knight, had an affair with my mother so I removed him from the Kingsguard.

I few weeks back I tried it again and finally it clicked somehow and I've been dying to tell somebody about my first adventure.

So I played Bobby B in the Crowned Stag scenario since that sounded nice and easy for a beginner.

Firstly, Ned Stark and Tywin both die within the first year or so. I want to plot to kill Cersei but it backfires, everybody hates Robert. So I just imprison and behead her without any good reason. Robert's now a tyrant.

I plan to kidnap Dany and it works. I realize I can force marry prisoners, Robert is now married to Dany (who's like 8 or something).

Robert gets poisoned pretty much right away. Stannis takes over and is already married with 3 children. I manage to marry his oldest to Dany shortly before Stannis dies of severe stress.

Then Tristan Baratheon and Dany live and rule happily for 46 years, have lots of children. Then the Great Sickness strikes King's Landing, most of the children die, Dany dies, Tristan dies. His son takes over and rules for like a month before he also dies.

In the end I was only left with a sister of Tristan who had been living in Braavos and was a follower of the Many Faced God and also cruel. People hated her and there were so many hostile factions it was insane.

I had her convert to the Faith of the Seven but it was too late. She was assassinated and then her little son took over for a few months before also being killed when literally every kingdom joined a war to depose him.

Sooo nothing special, but I'm just excited that I finally played a whole game and had fun with it.","I made literal dwarfs. I thought the norvoshi with their forked beards look rather dwarvish so I made my starting character norvoshi in ethnicity but I started in the westerlands. I wanted a place where I could eventually start a gold mine but where one wasn’t already established. (I can’t remember where it was, but i found the perfect place).

Obviously my character was a literal dwarf. And I also made him greedy, strong, a drunkard, diligent, and an administrator. I also gave him a high stewardship education (and yes I kind of cheated with his age, but I dislike how you can’t add any traits without making them old). 

Anyway, it was a lot of fun and the game ended when I felt too powerful as I was in a position to take over all the westerlands and it didn’t really feel right for that house, so I decided to retire them. 

It was one of the most fun houses I’ve had though. I didn’t want to take over the world. Just get mega rich and gain a lot of artifacts and treasures.","I started as Rodrik Forrester, and took over Wolfswood. Stannis lost as he always does, so I focused on bringing down Boltons from the inside. The opportunity came soon, since Boltons were so hated, to put fake Arya - Jeyne Poole - on the throne of Winterfell, which I did. The problem was, however, that she was married to Ramsey, and all of her kids were of Bolton dynasty.  
I served her faithfully until she died of old age, helping her establish an indepedent Kingdom of the North, and when she died, I overthrew moanrchy and created the North Republic.","In my latest Jon AFFC playthrough, I married him to Val, got an attractive son from her, console commanded all of Jon's black brothers friends in his court (removing their nightswatch trait) as well as Asha and Theon, and Mance Rayder and his son.

Everything was set up for a wholesome playthrough in which Jon rule the North surrounded by all his friends. Until the White Walkers kicked in and slaughtered every single person in my court by sieging Winterfell. Including Samwell Tarly, Mance Rayder and his son, Grenn, Pip, Gilly, Rickon, Jon's wife, Jon's son.

At the cost of everything he was willing to fight for, Jon ultimately managed to beat the White Walkers and take the Iron Throne from Stannis, in retaliation for his lack of help in the Long Night. Only to be betrayed by the surviving Littlefinger, Sansa Stark, and their loads of genius sons.

Eventually after all that Bran showed up after being missing for decades, and y'know. Who had a better story than him amirite?","I was playing Robb Stark.

Roslin Frey died before giving me a child, and I put off marrying again until the war was done.  When I was secure in my kingdom, I decided I should marry a Northern woman.  And who was one of the most eligible women in the North at this time?  Lyanna Mormont.  Hell yeah, I said.

Robb and Lyanna had the event to fall in love almost immediately, and the next few decades were fantastic.  She gave me three sons in a row, Eddard, Brandon, and Benjen.  Eddard was strong, and all of them grew up with great skills.  The economy was going great.  The South was tearing itself to pieces, the North was secure, and my family was happy.

After my first three boys she gave me three girls; Sansa, Lyarra, and Catelyn.  Then a fourth boy, Rickard.

And then our eighth child.  Little Maege Stark.

We knew from the start that there was something off about Maege.  She didn't cry like other children, and the direwolves shied away from her.  She didn't fit into the family like the other children.  A few years passed, and my boys were beset with terrible nightmares.

And then they all began to die, one by one.  They disappeared, they died in accidents, they woke up screaming and seemed to die from fright.  One by one, all seven of my older children died, until all that was left was little Maege and her devious smile.

My dear wife died of an illness not long after Maege came of age, and beset with depression, I took my own life.

The latter saw through and Lord Cregan was immortalized. Later he would find a dragon egg in the crypts of winterfell and after a tour of the 7 kingdoms, volantis and the smoking sea, Lord Cregan hatched a dragon who breathed white flame and named it Icebreaker. Unfortunately the game started crashing before his story could be finished but it was awesome.","I started out as Rhaegar during  Robert's Rebellion. Immediately started a plot to kidnap Aerys and it gets overwhelming support. The plot succeeds within a year and I manage to force him to abdicate. I then corner Bobby B in the Riverlands and and end the war by capturing him in battle, although Gerold Hightower dies during this battle.

After the war is over I pardon Ned Stark and Jon Arryn, letting them bend the knee, but send a still living Robert to the wall, giving the Stormlands to Stannis.

Tower of Joy event occurs and thankfully both Lyanna and the baby survive, I take her back to Kings landing as my mistress and make Jon a true Targ, using the consol command to change his name to Jahaerys.

I betroth my son Aegon to Margaery Tyrell and Rhaenys to Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion eventually becomes my master of coin and their children are all brilliant. Despite him being a dwarf and Rhaenys hating me for betrothing her to him, they manage to actually fall in love and have a good marriage.

I squire both Aegon and Jahaerys to Arthur Dayne and Barristan Selmy respectively, they both grow up to to be great fighters. Marry Jahaerys to Danaerys (because of course right?) and give them Summerhall as a seat.

I end up having three more children with Lyanna, one of which is a girl named Aemma who joins the Kingsguard (she was fostered by Oberyn, so there's that going for her). But all in all, I was trying to play this run as a sort of stability run, rebuild the kingdoms and fight as few wars as possible, and rebuild all the relationships that Bobby B's rebellion destroyed. A good run.","TL;Dr:  Trojan War but with the Wildling King.

I had a great end to a game that began to crash.  I had a high stat Targaryen heir Maekar Targaryen from Rhaegar's line (RR bookmark) who the AI made a Master Seducer.  Wanting to make sure he only made bastards with good genes I played him as High Lord of Tyrosh, the new heir's seat replacing Dragonstone.

There was a King Beyond the Wall at this time and to build up martial I had my Targaryen heir return from a brothel run through Yi-Ti to attack the Wildlings.  I took their capital and captured the Wildling King's young wife. I had him rape her since her stats were good and I wanted to humiliate the Wildling leader.

Welp, he captures the Night Watch LC and gains the wall.  Then the event triggers that awakens the giants and creates 40,000 to 60,000 event spawned Wildlings pouring into the North.

My Tyrosh army gets reduced to 600 men and the Wildling are tearing the North as far as besieging Winterfell and the Dreadfort.  I thought I may lose since most big vassals were busy with tyranny wars or didn't join to help. Soon my heir inherits the Iron Throne and thankfully I didn't ban the Faith Militant yet.  Joining with an army of fanatics we chip at their numbers.

Eventually my new King Maekar confronts the King Beyond the Wall in a duel.  I kill the Wildling and the invasion immediately ends. His wife was kept in the dungeons as a sex slave and her two bastard daughters were raises Faith of Seven for the final insult.","I got one. Queen Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen did not go to Slaver's bay but rather sailed to Pentos and married Aegon. They had 2 sons (Aegon the Younger and Aemon) and three daughters (Visenya, Rhaenys, Aelinor). Rob had captured Joffery and beheaded him and Jamie before handing the crown to Stannis. Stannis and the other territories of the Realm gave one hell of a fight before surrendering to Daenerys. Of them, only Stannis met his untimely end. He had lost and his daughter and wife aere captives. So the man had fled to Volantis leaving them to their fate. Daeny killed the wife and released Shireen. The Lord Paramounts aere happy enough. Stannis returned years later with a red priest of R'hollr and tried to convert the Dragon Queen. They both were killed outright and fed to Drogon. Later Aegon the Elder, left to conquer Essos after leaving a 41 to Dawnys pregnant with Aelinor. In her time Daenerys ruled for 50 years to the day and was famed and beloved. And feared, but mostly the first two. Oh and the Srarks turned into blood thirsty monsters.","Eh I was playing as Jorah Mallister, the Lord of Seagard during the Dance of Dragons. Eventually I was able to marry my firstborn daughter to a dragon-rider Targaryen and gain extremely good marriages for the rest of them (I had only daughters, but it worked out this time). So I decided it was time to kill myself since my grandson was a genius with Targaryen bloodline. So I decided to go out in style. 

I, Jorah Mallister Hand of the King will die trying to mount Goldenfyre. So I click, and I’m successful. I was kind of stunned at this point. Goldenfyre might have the most trainable traits in the game, but the natural chance of taking a dragon is like 1/400. At this point I’m jokingly thinking about if the Greyjoys try that “raiding” thing again. So then the Iron Bank calls and tells me that Cregan Stark didn’t pay his debts. So naturally I rally the banners of Seagard, and with 2 dragon riders (myself and my son in law) we smash the Northern armies and seize Winterfell. That was how a Mallister became Lord Paramount of the North. 

Anyways, Rhaenyra (the fool) lost the throne in a tyranny war after the Dance and a Lord Protector was put into place. Being a dragonrider with 20 stewardship and 19 marshal I was elected to the position. Then I took the quest to locate a Valyrian Steel Sword for my house, which I promptly named Lord Valorous. This was how House Mallister truly became “Above the Rest”. 

Now something to mention. Within a generation of Jorah’s death the plague hit Westeros and in this plague many notable houses went extinct, most notably houses Velaryon, Reyne, Tarbeck, and Tyrell. It also killed off half of House Targaryen and made my (then) husband the owner of Dark Sister. Then when my character and him died the genius character I mentioned earlier inherited several dragon eggs, and both Dark Sister and Lord Valorous. Downright ridiculous run for within 3 generations.

House Mallister - “Above the Rest”","This was a few years ago by now, so I don't quite remember all the details. I started as the Mad King during Robert's Rebellion. There was some kind of bug that made the rebellion insta-fail, but Robert soon declared war for the throne based on his own claim anyway. Aerys himself was quickly killed in battle by Denly Thorne (brother of the infamous ser Alliser) and Rhaegar claimed the throne. We were losing on all sides, so I made a desperation move and try to lay siege to Storm's End. Somehow, it worked. Robert and his armies were heading for me. Rheagar fought not one, but two warriors before he stood face to face with Robert himself. Suffering a terrible wound during the battle, Rhaegar managed to kill his opponent and end the war.   


Illness had claimed Elia Martell during the war, and so Rhaegar remarried to Lyanna. Unfortunately, Rhaegar's wounds took a turn for the worse after the war ended. His young son, Aegon VI, took the throne. Shortly after Rhaegar's death, Lyanna gave birth to a child, a boy she named Rhaegar. Aegon served as king for almost sixty years, appointing his half-brother Rhaegar as Lord of the Vale following an uprising from the Arryns. He had five children who survived to old age; Baelor the Mad, Daenerys, Daemon, and two others whose names escape me. The eldest, Baelor, was deemed unfit for the throne by his father and was forced to take the black. Somewhen in his late sixties or seventies, Aegon is poisoned. The assailant is unknown, and Daemon takes the throne.  


Daemon's reign is a chaotic one, as his younger siblings vie for the throne as well. Meanwhile, in the far north, Baelor has defected from the Watch and gone to join the wildlings. He is married to a Queen Beyond the Wall who leads several unsuccessful raids on the Watch. The game ended with Daemon's daughter, Syaella, becoming Princess of Dorne and soon being ousted in favor of a local noble. The Targaryens still reigned in the north, but it was her uncle and aunt who sat on the Iron Throne, rather than herself.","In one of my AFFC start playthroughs, Mance Rayder’s son Owen became a formidable fighter and a Knight after being raised at Storm’s End after Dany let Stannis bend the knee and retain the stormlands. He was appointed the King’s Guard at 15, rose to Lord Commander by 25. He later was discovered to have been carrying on an affair with Missendei, was sent to the wall. At the wall, Owen deserted and became King Beyond the Wall, as his father had been. It took him until the age of 39 but he conquered the Night’s Watch and killed Jon Snow in single combat.","Played as Torrhen Stark in Aegons Conquest Bookmark, with the goal of slowly building up the North into an impenetrable fortress able to defend itself against the entirety of the South.  


\-Got a super good Castellan and upgraded the 3 towers of Moat Cailin into larger castle levels and built a fourth castle in the empty holding slot, renaming them to Southwall, Eastwall, Westwall and Northwall as if the four holdings are the defenses pointing each direction of the rebuilt fortress.  
\-Built up Winterfell's demense for as much income as possible  
\-Turned Sea Dragon Point into a western version of White Harbour and granted it to the line of Torrhen's half brother, Brandon Snow, whose descendants became House Seastark.  
\-Wiped out the Boltons and replaced them with another Cadet House, Darkstark. Also started House Redstark in a Barony in one of the Winterfell dutchy's counties.  
\-Started the Bank of Winterfell to increase profits for the North  
\-Managed to gain independence while a civil war was going on in the Iron Throne  
\-Repelled at least 1 attempt to reconquer the North every 10 or so years(whatever length truce's last after a war) for nearly a century, including one Stark slaying a Dragon at White Harbour, and an uncountable number of battles where I wiped out larger forces at Moat Cailin because of the terrain bonuses the Moat gives as well as having recruited dragon riders through marriage later on. I won wars usually solely through winning battles, as I'd led armies too big to fight run about the north sieging and taking attrition from enemy territory and usually also winter, until they were small enough to smash. My armies would dance around the north to avoid direct battle until they could catch smaller armies and inferior ones. I remember in one of the longer lasting wars I counted up the battle casualties near the end and it was something like 25k losses for me against like 170k losses for my combined enemies. I also built up the navy of the north and used it to sail my army on multiple occasions from white harbour down to the Crownlands, bypassing the riverlands entirely, and sieging down Kings Landing while all my enemies were freezing to death in the North.  


TL;DR: I played the North as the unconquerable monster it's meant to be and bathed in the blood of southerners.","Ah my first game... Eddard became the grand champion of the Seven Kingdoms and then died to a small wound. Robb was killed by Tywin in personal combat, and Bran also died. I was playing as Sansa in the end when Arya returned now married to a Frey. The Iron Throne was taken over by House Brax, everything had the unicorn on it and they also marched to take the North, I was only left with Winterfell. Chaos is truly a ladder","Once my heir decided Join a free Company, not satisfied he gains several lands around essos, joining another Wars, jumping from a city tô another finished ben killed in a single combat in a civil war in Bravos. At this time he was a lord in Bravos marshes.","Rhaelle Naelaros, First of Her Name, Lady-Paramount of the Stepstones and former queen

Born Rhaelle Waters she was one of the many bastards sired by Lady Visenya following the dissolution of the marriage between Aegon and her.

Naturally sharp-witted but shy, she spent most of her time in the libraries of the fledging Red Keep. Mayhaps these books gave her a revelation as she tamed the Balerion and set out to carve a realm in the Stepstones

Through fire and blood the Stepstones were united under Rhaelle and she was crowned a queen in her own right. King Haerys I Targaryen unsurprisingly saw this as a threat

Years of war passed and thousands of men from both sides died in the Stepstones alongside 4 dragons brought down by Rhaelle and Balerion including Vhagar, the dragon rode by her late mother

Eventually captured and imprisoned in the Red Keep, she would retain her life, lands and incomes in exchange of bending the knee, becoming a Lord-Paramount and lifetime in prison

Rhaelle would spend the last years of her life locked in the Red Keep until dying of old age under the reign of Queen Daena I Targaryen","Playing as a merged branch of Stark-Greyjoys called the Greystarks that emerged during the battle of the five kings on the farthest west island of the Iron Isles. After being hidden for years, Brandon Greystark, the founder of the bloodline and descendant of both great houses, amassed an army and won the kingsmoot for the Iron Islands after Balon Greyjoy's death at the hands of his brother, Euron. He married Asha Greyjoy to settle the peace between the houses.

The Greystark house is a merge of the Greyjoys and the Starks, taking elements of both their personalities. Fiercely loyal to their families, they take an element of honor from the Starks. At the same time the Greystarks are ruthless ravagers, taking the religions and traditions from the Greyjoys. 

Brandon, who was around the same age as Robb Stark, desired to press his claim on the North, but respected his relative's titles. After meeting and becoming friends after Brandon raided King's Landing, clearing the way for Robb to seize the capital and kill the Lannisters, Brandon and Robb became good friends. After about twenty years, the Greystark house had become one of the wealthiest in the land, and Brandon had taken several wives from great houses, including Margarey Tyrell, an Aryyn daughter, Daenerys Targaryen (her son ruled in Mareen), a Lannister woman, Shireen Baratheon, and several others. His heart was still with his wife, Asha, however. 

Unfortunately, Robb Stark died an early death, and the North fell into succession wars. At this point, Brandon decided to press his claim, since he was one of the few who was respected enough to rule. After winning the 5-year war, Brandon was king of the Iron Islands, the North, and the Riverlands, naming the kingdom the Iron North. 

Towards the end of his life, Brandon set out on raid after raid, obsessed with finding every great house's Valyrian Steel swords, which was a desire eventually fulfilled by his heir. He reformed his relgion, became a God-King, became a legendary hero of the drowned society, and was followed by his daughter by Daenerys, Rhaella, who herself was known as a great leader. She tamed a dragon and expanded the realm even further. His one true-born heir with Asha died in his mid-20s, but arose from the ocean as a drowned man. He leads Rhaella's armies.","It has been a while since I’ve had a compelling playthrough, so here’s an old one.

I was playing as Renly Baratheon before he got killed. I avoided Stannis' monster thing and won the war against him and Joffery. I then proceeded to have a single son his name was Lyonel Baratheon he had white hair and grew up to be an amazing warrior. In this game, Daenerys died and there was a new owner of Drogon. While reigning as Renly I invited the new owner of Drogon to my court where he stayed. However, Renly died at the age of 56 from gonorrhea his son Lyonel took the throne. At the same time, Drogon killed his owner giving Lyonel a chance to tame the dragon which he did. He took Drogon and concurred all of the free Seven kingdoms he then flew to Pentos, Myr and the rest of Essos and concurred them with most of them surrendering. That is the story of Lyonel Baratheon.",Made my own post a few years ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/1oivg4/king\_euron\_greyjoy\_the\_ladies\_man/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/1oivg4/king_euron_greyjoy_the_ladies_man/),"One time I was playing as Princess Visenya, King Maegor's daughter, who grew up to be more like her mother, Queen Ceryse, than her father in personality (to many people's relief, I'm sure). She had a half-sister, Princess Leaysa, daughter of Queen Alys, but she died stillborn. She was granted the seat of Dragon's Den (formerly Dyre Den), and was the Lady of Dragonpoint (formerly Crackclaw Point).

Prince Aegon declared war for his claim and lost, and he and his wife Princess Rhaena were imprisoned and died in King Maegor's dungeons. Their daughter Princess Aerea became the new Lady of Dragonstone, but then she died of suspicious circumstances (and not because of me, I assure you), so her sister Princess Rhaella inherits. Prince Viserys died after being tortured by Maegor, just like canon. The Faith lost, too, and so did all the lords who declared for independence after.

Rhaella and Visenya's remaining cousins didn't like her that much as she's a pretender and claimant to the Iron Throne, and even more so when her father nominated her as the heir, and that no relation should come before her. Prince Jaehaerys was betrothed to Rhaella, but then eloped with Princess Alysanne.

When Visenya was 15, Maegor died of horrific burns. But she wasn't crowned - it was Jaehaerys instead, crowned by his mother, Alyssa, in his new crown, a gold band with seven different-coloured gemstones. Even worse, he imprisoned Ceryse, her mother!

The Iron Islands supported Visenya, and so did the High Septon (surprisingly), and other minor houses. The Reach went neutral, and everyone else supported Jaehaerys. Meanwhile, Balerion flew to Dragon's Den and was tamed by Visenya.

It's hard at first as I had to try and stop Dragonpoint from being stomped, especially as I couldn't use Balerion yet. But after I came of age, it got easier, especially with the Iron Islands and the Faith helping.

Jaehaerys was sent to the Wall. Were it be anyone else he would've been executed, but no man is more accursed than a kinslayer, so. Alysanne was called on trial and found guilty for conspiracy against the realm, and she was sent to the sept to become a Silent Sister. Rhaella had her lordship revoked, and married some random lord.

Visenya was crowned by the High Septon in an extravagant ceremony. She wore the crown of her father, Maegor, and her grandfather, King Aegon the Conqueror. There was unrest during her ascension, and during the early years of her rule she kept the realm together and swayed the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to her side, since they didn't have a high opinion of her father.

Visenya later married the second son of the Triarch of Volantis, and had several children. Queen Dowager Ceryse Hightower would die of the flu a few days after her eldest son, Prince Maegor, was born. Maegor eventually eloped with a peasant from Dragon's Gate, and forfeited his inheritance, passing the throne to his younger brother, the well-liked Prince Aegon. Aegon married his younger sister Princess Ceryse, and Visenya's youngest children Prince Aerion and Princess Viserra married each other too. She would then be friends with her husband, and grew to love him as well. When he died a natural death, she was devastated, and sought solace in the arms of another.

Visenya's reign was long and and peaceful. She died at the age of 65, bedridden and infirm, surrounded by her children and grandchildren. Known as Queen Visenya 'the Just', may she find peace with the Gods.

Thus House Targaryen is descended from the line of King Aegon the Conqueror and Queen Visenya.

Not as epic as all the other stories here, but I really enjoyed this playthrough. Definitely a better story than Bran the Broken.","I was playing as a house customiser'd son of Stannis Baratheon,  and a follower of the Lord of Light

After Stannis won the war of the five kings, I intrigued it up with my buddy Harrold Arryn (because I guess Robin and everyone else died?) and plotted for him to start a revolt. Which worked. It ended up working out for me and before long Stannis was in the Eyrie and I was king. To start my great conversion of Westeros, I revoked Harrenhal from a Frey (got a few tyrant points there) and granted it to Beric Dondarrion of the Brotherhood Without Banners. During this time, Harrold kept trying to ransom me Stannis, who was my heir at the time, to which I responded with 'oh nah you can just keep him'. As my character was burned (thought it'd be a nice trait in the Character customiser, a zealous follower of R'hllor who was once rejected by the red god) I tried to heal my disfigurement many times to no avail. *However* I did manage to convert most lords of the seven kingdoms. For Tyrion, Loras, Harrold and Doran I put them on the council, then used 'Cure Ailments' or 'Cure disfigurements'. I continued my attempts until they healed, after which they became R'hllor zealots. Eventually, I decided to finally pay Stannis' ransom, managed to imprison him for other crimes and then he demanded a trial by combat. He chose himself, so I thought I'd solve the problem on my own.

I dueled Stannis and won. But then he was resurrected. To which I said. 'Oh great. We'll sacrifice you'. I then had the Kinslayer trait and not a lot of friends, but a *lot* of bastards. Eventually, Edric legitimised himself. Which, I'd been wanting to do for a while but couldn't manage to. He was made King (not lord paramount, keeping it in the family) of the Stormland and was married to Gerion Lannister's bastard, Joy Hill.

The game continues currently. I've had two faith of the seven revolts thus far.

Oh, and random bit? *Dany died taking a shit from dysentery.* *~~The more she drank~~* ***~~the more she shat.~~*** So it comes up one day 'Pyat Pree rides Viserion!' Which I was like 'oh shit he took the dragon what a madlad'. Then another random Qartheen person. Then finally a random woman from YiTi rode Drogon. She came to my court, I kidnapped her, and killed her in hopes of getting a dragon. Drogon flew off to a ruin in the Dothraki sea.   


So there was no Breaker of Chains. Thanks for the diarrhoea chapter, George.","I'm going through a House Piper run, pre-Aegon's conquest. I consoled into my family, the fair trait and the brave trait, to match House Piper's family words, ""Brave and Beautiful"". I immediately sought to usurp House Hoare, and denied to assist when they went to war against the Rock for a dejure county of the Trident. Soon after the Hoare's won the war, Harren the Black decided he was upset I didn't help, and tried to revoke my lands. 
I decided to rebel, because hey, what else could I do? Submit to a early game over? Luckily, almost all of the riverlands rose up in rebellion alongside me, and we managed to rush down Harrenhal before the Iron Islands armies could wreak too much havoc on the Riverlands. Immediately decided to claim the throne for myself instead of appointing one of Harren's sons and made Harrenhal my new capital, renaming it to Maidenpearl. New King Alyn Piper promptly built up a small cash fund, bought a favor off of Meria Martell, and used it to make her granddaughter, her heir's heir, marry my own heir, my son. Thus I acquire Dorne peacefully in a few generations. Super lucky playthrough so far since Aegon fucked off to Essos, leaving me to be the new superpower in Westeros.","Kit ""the Cannibal"" Blackfyre 
Lord paramount of the Trident, Alchemist,  and hand of the King. 

Eldest son of Theadora and (I forget his father's name  but he was a Tully) who after his mother was killed during one of the meny Targaryen Civil wars was placed in charge at the age of six.

He was overthrown  a few years later, probably due to him showing signs of insanity in favor of his brother Clarance who proceeded to drink himself to death he was made lord again was overthrown again but eventually  ruled  again.

He would aid in Removing house Targaryen from the Iron throne and placing house Orralion (I think that was the name)  upon it. 

During an epademic he would catch  a thief  stealing  food... and would eat him gaining  the cannibal trait .

During this time he would be made hand of the king and would serve well in the small council. 

Then for some reason the wall fell to Wildlings and the realm  rallied against them.

Kit would fight in this war capturing (and then eating)  the current king beyond the Wall.
At the same time the king was wounded in battle, his wounds  became infected and he died leaving his infant son as king
And of all the people to be made regent for the boy it was Kit blackfyre... who dispite being a lunatic and cannibal he was a good diplomat and steward with a strong sense of  justice.

He would basically rule the seven kingdoms until the boy was of age. And the rest of his rain  remained quiet with him rebuilding the economy, administrating his realm, and working with the alchemists guild.

He would die at the age of 66 after trying to  drink wildfire (don't ask me).","I once had a playthrough (I was Baelish) where Mance did Mance stuff. First he beat the white walkers (lost his two young daughters) then lost to NW and they killed his 4th abd 5th children. But he lived. He rebuilt his kingdom and attacked again. This time his 3rd and 8th child were killed but he won. He then declared war on Rickon + Edmure + Vale (at this point house Baelish had taken over Dorne😂) anyways the Vale clans invaded too. So there ended with the king beyond the wall owning the north. The king of the Vale bending the knee to the king in the north who ruled from River Run (but was a stark). 
Eventually he died. But left no heirs. The Vale clans men had killed the last 2. 

He thanosed himself. “I united the north, what did it cost? Everything” none of his 8 kids lived older than 13.","I was playing 1 year after aegons conquest as Loren lannister and I managed to take the iron throne as him.

I first married and reproduced so I could preserve my dynasty as one of my brothers was on the watch and my other was called by aegon to join the kings guard. Dont remember who I married, not really important.

I eventually betrothed my first son and heir to the daughter of lord Tully and then invaded the riverlands to put her in charge. 

Eventually, aegon died and his son took over but was quickly killed and succeeded by his other son who was homosexual and so easy to convince the realm to depose, with the exception of the storm lands as orys who had tamed baelor the black dread was still around. I managed to depose the gay king and make myself the regent to his lunatic younger brother. Sadly the lords didn't want him either and so orys started another rebellion with just as much support as mine. I then defected to the gay kings side again.

But whilst I was regent I had managed to fabricate a claim on the throne. 

Once the war was won I began my faction. It was me, the riverlands and most of the crown lands whom wanted me as king. Meanwhile the throne had the king, his aunts/mothers, his cousin and orys.

I managed to eventually win by just avoiding dragon riding armies which mostly translated to running away from the stormlands. 

When I won the war I exiled the dragon riding king whom I had deposed for the second time to the nights watch hoping he would do something funny (which sadly he didnt). His brother I simply executed because I do not need dragon riders claiming my throne. All the female targaryens fled Westeros. 

As for house baratheon I let them live because I didn't want to piss off a dragon rider.","My other story is as sigorn thenn in AFFC. I dont think he gets enough love for how free his character can be. 

I chose to join stannis because screw sitting on the wall all game, I want land. 

I was helping stannis fight the boltons and we were winning when aegon beat stannis. Due to the thenn legally being a duchy this meant I couldn't be Stannis' vassal anymore as he was also a duchy so I became aegons vassal. However I was not done yet.

I marched south to the riverlands where I attacked blackwood. The original goal was rivverrun but the garrison reinforced before I could get there so I'll settle for scraps. I managed to eventually beat blackwood and became it's new lord or chief. 

For some reason I was able to immediately the blackwood levies which gave me 2000 men in addition to the 1000 I still had. I used these men to take stone hedge. 

After a few years the white walkers were creaming and there was nobody to stop them so I figured I have to be azhor ahai in honour of stannis. But I couldn't do that without power. So I attacked littlefinger.

Eventually I managed to win and became lord of the trident. Then whilst I was trying to take riverrun from house Frey for a true capital, the white walkers attacked. 

I only had 20,000 men against their 120,000 but I'll be damned if I'm going down without a fight. I managed to fight valiantly, I beat them in many battles, i think in total i killed 50,000 wights, but i simply didn't have the numbers. I surrendered and they took both raventree hall and rivverrun from me, leaving me with just stone hedge. 

The white walkers killed my children and my wife, and I was effectively the last thenn standing. I swore fealty to queen myrcella but sadly some stannis loyalists whom still had land in the north attacked her and caused the mega war to fuck me. The white walkers attacked again and I was losing bad. But I got the last laugh as some random person assassinated me and ended my game before those overhyped zombie fucks could have the pleasure.","The wall fell. As did Winterfell. And Riverrun, the Eyrie, the Rock, and King's Landing.

Daenerys Targaryen, betrayed and heartbroken by her own nephew, watched the continent burn. Then freeze.

She retreated to live atop Dragonstone for decades, as the hordes of undead marched South and brought Winter with them.

By 8330, only Dorne and the Iron Isles existed. by 340, nothing but islands of Westeros persevered. Daenerys Targaryen was Queen of Nothing. She sat atop Dragonstone and didn't rule a kingdom.

But she did rule a cult. Driven mad by the disaster that was her life, she turned to the darkness of Nylarthotep after converting to the old Valyrian faith. She rose through the ranks and became the High Priest.

And bore the son of Darkness once more - the true mount of the world. 

And then she died.

What would her son become? Azor Ahai reborn? The stallion who mounts the world? Time will tell.","Start as Orys Baratheon.

I was on my very first CK2 GoT playthrough, and had only played the tutorial of the base game prior to that, so I was pretty green and looking for a small, insignificant House to learn the ropes with, and observe the actually important characters go at it from afar. The Forresters fit that bill well. Little did I know, my crappy cliffnote-level family would soon become far more important than I anticipated.  


I started at the Clash of Kings bookmark, controlling Lord Gregor Forrester, who was at the time castellan to Lord Glover. Right off the bat there were a couple of changes in this timeline I spawned. Robb actually wed his Frey wife and didn't get offed at the Red Wedding, only to live for a couple more years and get imprisoned by Joffrey somehow anyway, losing the war and his head with it.  Sansa died from severe stress, still a prisoner in King's Landing, Arya had been gone at the start of the bookmark, and The Greyjoy betrayal event had fired before Robb's death, resulting in the usual disappearance of Bran and Rickon. With no Stark heir, the Karstarks rose to Lord Paramouncy, only for Rickon to later return from Skaggos and claim it back. Anyway, the status of the Stark family so far was none of my doing, but it will be important to the story that follows.  


So, here I am, doing my best to be a dutiful castellan to Lord Glover, learning the game as I go. My eldest son and heir, Rodrik, went and got himself killed bravely fighting the White Walkers, so my second son, Ethan, stood to inherit. I had begun looking for a fit match for him, and betrothed him to Erena Glover, Galbart's niece. Now in this continuity, Galbart himself had an infant son. Being the dutiful castellan that I was, I wished him all the best, but one day, a notification popped up that the child was murdered. The murderer had done a sloppy job and his name was revealled, and he turned out to be none other than my own son, Ethan (who stood to benefit from that death for his own future children's line of succession). Now, with Lord Gregor being honorable and just, I figured I had no choice, but to imprison Ethan and trial him. However, Ethan demanded a trial by combat, summoning none other than his exiled brother Asher as his champion. I had Lord Gregor champion himself. And so I died for the first time, with Asher overcoming his sire in combat.   


Ethan, freshly cleared of all charges, assumed Lordship. His education saw him becoming an intricate webweaver, so I fully transformed into this nw personna. Learning how to scheme in CK2 bit by bit, I started pulling strings in the North, with my eyes set on the High Lordship of Deepwood. Now, in one of the examples of this game's RNG beauty, Ethan met Littlefinger (Lord of Harrenhal and Lord Paramount of the Riverlands at the time) in a feat, and the two became best friends. Littlefinger even gave Ethan a book on intrigue of some kind, which helped to develop Ethan's already considerable intrigue skill. However, my schemes with regards to Deepwood weren't working very well. Erena eventually died after giving me no children, so there was little point to wiping out the Glover line as I had no way to take advantage of it. And that was when I struck gold with another random event.   


I got word that a woman claiming to be Arya Stark had resurfaced... in Harrenhal. Where my dear old friend Littlefinger ruled. Now, quite a few years had passed by now, which meant Arya was in her early 40s - just old enough to maybe still birth a son. A son with claim to Winterfell. And so, a few words to Littlefinger was all it took to get her to marry Ethan. The Old Gods were kind to me, because a few years later, she popped out a son, who, with no other surviving Starks, was next in line to Winterfel after Rickon (who was childless, depressed, and with cancer at the time) and Arya. Plotting Rickon's successful assassination seemed almost mercy at that point, and so Arya, with Ethan by her side, assumed power in the North. Now I poured every coin I had into making their son as well educated as I could make him, and in time, young Gariss Forrester rose to become Lord Paramount of the North, leading to many generations of Forrester Lords, with the name of House Stark slowly fading into obscurity.

 great-grandchild of Dany, the only other interesting (or funny depending on how you look at it) part of that game is that I put a stark in control of the westerlands, a lannister in the north, a tyrell in dorne, a targ in the iron islands, and last but not least a farwynd in the stormlands (this was my favorite act because I thought it was funny how a family who has always just had a single county would then be randomly boosted up to the king of the stormlands with his capital still in last light (I allowed royal privileges before granting the iron throne to dany’s great grandkid).

It’s in one of Dany’s chapters,"Its not really all that complex.

First there are Dragon Eggs.  You get one from Dragons or a few types of rare events.  Once you have an Egg you should lead a small army and go visit famous locations around the world to gather Dragon Lore.  The more lore you have the better your chances are to hatch your Egg.

Once you decide you are ready you can attempt to hatch the Egg.  Your chances are decided by how much Dragon Lore you collected and several other factors such as if you have built a Dragonpit, have Dragon Rider family members, are genius or brave, ect.

Once you hatch a Dragon it becomes your friend but you are not a Dragon Rider yet.  Once the Dragon turns 2 you can attempt to mount it.  Your chances of this are based on your traits, culture, dynasty, religion, having a Dragonpit, ect.

Upon successfully becoming a Dragon Rider you can now deploy your Dragon in battle via an Intrigue decision.  This decision is available in all regions except Desert and Mountain counties.  Dragons are extremely devastating in battle and can allow tiny armies to decimate ones 10x their size.  How much damage is calculated by your Dragon's Martial skill which increases naturally with age.  The more Martial a Dragon has, the more damage it does in battle and less chance it has to become wounded or maimed.  On the off chance your Dragon does become Wounded its Martial will take a hit until it heals.  Maiming will make your Dragon unusable until it heals up to Wounded.  A maimed Dragon has a chance of dying completely.  Dragons will generally live to be around 150 but can die sooner or later depending on RNG.  Luckily if your Dragon dies you have a 1/3 chance to find a last clutch of Eggs to restart the process.  You are also able to make powerful artifacts from your Dragon's bones for some cash.

The next big topic is Dragon Duels.  Dragon's have a personal Combat Score which is used along with its Martial to determine the outcome of Dragon Duels.  Dragon duels occur when a Dragon Rider leads an army into battle against another army with a Dragon Rider.  Generally the older Dragon will win but that is not always the case.  There can also be Multiple Dragon Riding Commanders leading armies against each other.  When this happens the two sides will clash until one sides Dragons are all maimed or dead.

""Sandkings"" is a novelette by American writer George R. R. Martin, first published in the August 1979 issue of Omni. In 1980, it won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette, the Nebula Award for Best Novelette and the Locus Award for best novelette, and was nominated for the Balrog Award in short fiction. It is the only one of Martin's stories to date to have won both the Hugo and the Nebula. It was included in the short story collection of the same name, published by Timescape Books in December 1981.

So I was kind of bored a couple of days ago and decided to start a campaign in the conquest bookmark as a random vassal and try to work my way up. It's pretty fun because after Aegon's conquest you always get a non-canon asset of the Seven Kingdoms(like this time the Estermonts got made LP of the Stormlands and the Harroways of the Trident), and there are a lot of chances to quickly raise your opinion of Aegon just by siding with him and joining his wars that he will win anyway, so a high chance of getting granted stuff. 

I picked randomly the Masseys, and got transfered a bunch of lesser crownlands nobles as my vassals, giving me the chance to build my powerbase and submit a couple more of them through fabricating claims. Anyway,so far so good. The weird part is that Aegon never had any heirs, so after he died the throne went to Orys Baratheon's (legitimized Targaryen) heirs and lords of Harrenhal. They weren't dragon riders and they weren't high valyrians, so you can actaully fuck with them. 

And I did. With my third ruler, I saw that the new King was a baby, selected the ambition to become regent and got my way. When the king is a baby, you can actually grant to yourself as regent all the holdings that they have bar their primary holding. It was just random castles, but I took them ,took the high lordship of Stokeworth, gave away the bad stuff to vassals and kept the good stuff. When the king grew up though, he tried to revoke them as he had a claim. Fuck that. 

The entire kingdom rose up with me as he was very unpopular, I won, and selectd the option to keep the king as my bitch in prison and rule myself as regent, again granting me more titles. My great third ruler died, the new one is a baby and the King got released by a plot because of the new baby Massey. 

Then he tried to revoke my shit once again. And once again, he got stomped. This time i couldn't rule as regent because i was a baby. So i figured ok, let's call a great council. And some random mayor somehow won, so now the Iron Throne is a republic. In the end, i got worse off because the new ""Archon"" actually appointed a new LP in the Riverlands that were vacant before, so now because i held some stuff there I just have a new liege. 

But I am having so much fun.",Thats some real ASOIAF stuff there man.,Why so little incest. The Blackfyre's were big supporters of more incest and despised Daeron for marrying Mariah.," The Blackfyre rebellion was won when Daeron Waters was captured at the battle of King's Landing and sent to the faith to live out his life in servitude , his children were spared and given Blackheart allowed to live out their days as vassals to the Baratheons. King Daemon ruled for 50 years before his natural death and was succeeded by his grandson Aegon ""the Black"" Blackfyre. Aegon ruled the kingdom for 23 years and crushed several Targaryen and Blackfyre attempts at the throne, he died a natural death at the age of 66. His son Aelor ruled for six short years before he died comatose in bed from wounds he took in a tournament. He was followed by his son Maelys ""the Dragon"" Blackfyre who has ruled with an iron will for 21 years and looks to further expand the Blackfyre dynasty into Essos. 

The family line is secure with 59 living members and we currently occupy Dragonstone, King's landing, Sweetport Sound, Adderdel, and several other smaller castles and cities.  We have three of the four living dragon riders in our dynasty and our military might is only threatened by sporadic civil wars which so far have been unsuccessful. With Maelys entrenched as a capable rule and his son and heir Raen ready to take over the Blackfyre dynasty is set to rule Westeros for the foreseeable future.","The red dragon will rise again, as it will in the HBO universe.",Why isn’t he Maelys II?,Things don’t always line up for it. Can’t have my heir wasting ten years waiting on a sister to marry.,"Traitor, I dare you to say that to King Maelys in the flesh.","There is no first, Aegon IV was the last Targaryen king as Daeron Waters was stripped of his rule due to being a bastard born from the loins of Aemon The Dragonknight.

Perhaps if your children are not an abomination of incest the genius trait might not be removed.

&#x200B;

So I'm going to play a Targaryen count in the north trying to work my way up to the Iron Throne during the Dance of the Dragons. During my playthrough the Dance goes horribly for the Blacks, who get absolutely curb stomped almost singlehandedly by Aemond One Eye. I mean I cannot stress this enough, I was constantly getting popups about Aemond winning Dragon duels, including against Deamon Targaryen who he kills. Aemond executes about half of house Velaryon, then when the war is over he blinds basically anyone still alive who fought for the greens. This man was ruthless.

So then Viserys dies Mysteriously, and then his kid dies Mysteriously (it ironically wasn't me) and because I used the character creator to make me Visery's brother, I become king (oh yeah, forgot to mention that Aemond executed all of Viserys grandkids with a dragon. That also happened.) So after becoming King the very first thing that happens is the North decides to rebel (Independence blah blah blah). So I crush them, and then I make Aemond Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, because he's a total badass and I definitely trust him to keep the Northerners in check.

So fast forward several years and I'm in the fight of my life against an independence war (I'm of the high Valyrian faith so that happens quite frequently). And Aemond One Eye, who is married to the Lady of the Stormlands, decides he actually wants to be King and declares war for the throne. After witnessing this guy's absolute rampage during the Dance of the Dragons, I immediately shit myself, take out as many loans as possible, and Merc up.

Aemond did not even make it south of the Neck before I got the popup that he'd been assassinated, poetically, by Joffery Velaryon. 20 Years after watching his uncle and aunt get killed,  his mother blinded, his step father burned alive and two of his brothers eaten by a dragon, Joffery decides to have their killer brought to justice. This was some redwedding shit #TheTidesRember.  Anyways, without Aemond the God to worry about, I easily sweep up on the independence war, and I'm very happy to see the new lady of the North, who is also heir to the Stormlands, is also betrothed to be my secondary wife, so that's a score for me.

Anyway, Joffery starts a war against his uncle and kicks his ass to take Blackwater rush, and the new Lady of the north, Rhaera is still young so she's under a regent. I go to war to invade Volantis, and Rhaera has to fight a war against almost the entire North trying to put the Starks in power. Following in her Father's footsteps, she not only wins, but mass executes the Northerners who betrayed her.

So there I am, with my army in Volantis, the war over there finally won, when suddenly Joffery resigns as my commander. And I look back to see why. He's being attacked in a Vengeance war by Rhaera, now my wife, who did not wait a fucking day after putting down the traitors in the North to march south and end this man's whole career.

* Inheriting as a weaker Martial character
* Upgrading your holdings with buildings that increase Garrison size. (The added Garrison troops come from your levy and your levy has to replenish)

1. Keep your heir in your court aka dont give them land. You need them here to keep them safe.
2. If they are dying of disease/ailments you need a good court physician to cure them and/or a good refuge to hopefully prevent it in the first place. You can also make diseases rarer in the game rules if you want.
3. Get a good spymaster who likes you and your heir. Keep them on the plot discovery job in your county where you and your heir live. If you find a plot against your heir dont be afraid to send them into hiding until you can end it.
4. Keep track of what your heir is doing even though he's in your court. Is he fathering bastards, scheming to claim land/get a council position etc? Kill/imprison/exile people who dont like your heir especially if they have any rivals.
5. Finally obviously dont put your heir in dangerous situations. No stupid duels/hunting trips/tournaments/leading armies etc where he can get unlucky and die.

One playthrough I saw Aurion 'the Conqueror' Varezys, who united all Free Cities, and died a natural death. The eldest of his many sons and daughters inherited, but many in New Valyria hated Aurion and hated his descendants, so they revolted. Constant wars, deaths and assassinations, and eventually they even lost their dragons. By the time the wars ended, the Varezys family was deposed, and the only surviving member was a female who's too old to bear children. Meanwhile I was relaxing in my little island, ruling my empire as Empress. I always wondered what would happen if I played one of Aurion's children.

This is why a daughter should be educated to be well mannered & groomed, to make a good impression on the king.

I'd conquered much of the world, but I lack for prisoners to feed to my dragon for dark magic.  Trying to knock off craven is a pain with this focus; and like 80% of my court is craven because one guy had it three generations ago.

Dark magic is great because you can cure wounds/ailments (including stressed and depressed) and the target becomes a member of the faith. Every time someone says no to the procedure, you get one dark magic mana. The only other way I know is to execute prisoners (.25 - 3 mana depending on victim's status), so you need to execute someone to get the ball rolling. Eating your children only gives health not magic which kinda sucks.  

I keep forgetting I have dark possession so I might just be bad.  Succession threat over.  Edit: You can cure dark possession cures dark possession with dark healing; just the usual ""don't use your powers too much.""

> He demanded a trial by combat

THAT is how you do it Ned.","Who does Ned pick as his champion?  Obviously he's injured and being held in the SHU under the Red Keep.  

Who is alive that he can pick that would A) actually agree -- and B) actually win, considering most likely Cersei will push the Crown champion to either The Mountain, a Jaime Lannister with both hands, or Selmy before she throws him out (as she's willing to discard him anyway.)  

I think GRRM set it up exactly for this reason -- there's no way out for Ned, even if he demands the Trial.  He's got as much chance of winning as his father did when Aerys Targaryen chose Fire as the Crown champion.","I'm pretty sure Ned can pull an Umber out that rivals the mountain. Also, isn't Roderick Cassel just as skilled as Jamie and Barristan?","Mah boi, Howland motherfucking Reed.",Can Blackfish do?,He can always call howland reed who is a formidable fighter,"I don't think there is anything that would indicate Roderick is on that level.  Great fighter, but they clearly place Selmy and Jaime at another level.

There are also logistics to consider... the Umbers are marching with Robb.  Winterfell isn't captured yet, but Roderick is de facto Lord with Robb gone and Bran being the Stark in Winterfell.  

I guess those two are potentially possibilities, but I doubt it.  

Greatjon IS a great pick, but asking the Lord of a House in open rebellion to walk into the Lions mouth doesn't sound like Ned, not to mention that this whole option doesn't consider that even if Ned wins, it doesn't enable him to leave with his daughters, which is the main reason I always felt he never considered this.","In game with his ridiculous stats?  Sure.

In GRRM world?  No way he is on the level of the Champion he would face.

I think it likely he was gravely injured at ToJ, and that is why he never leaves again.  That is obviously just my thought, though.",now we are talking... my blackfish have a chance in my opinion,"Probably the best answer, but he is also with the Northern Army even before Ned is killed, as Robb's main lieutenant.  

However, he IS an old man at this point, and I'm going to see him hard-pressed to beat either the Kingslayer with two hands or Clegane or Selmy.

I think he is probably Ned's best chance, though.  Great answer.","He is only a formidable fighter in game, and even that is only to make sure the Tower of Joy is playable for people.  

Howland Reed is definitely no combat genius or anything, he was wounded and out of the battle almost immediately at the ToJ, by what we are shown in the show.  The entire reason he meets the Starks in the first place is because he is being bullied, and Lyanna has to defend him. (Knight of the Laughing Tree.)

If there is one thing I hate about how they had to do the mod, it is that everyone now thinks Howland Reed is a Jaime Lannister-level fighter.  He wasn't anywhere close by anything in canon.",The north wasn’t in open rebellion until after Ned’s death no?,"> he is also with the Northern Army

Even better, he'll be faster to arrive. Also, Jaime is around, so the combat can happen on neutral field.","Here is a summary of the lore, just in case you aren't familiar with the novellas and side lore:

https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight_of_the_Laughing_Tree/Theories","Incorrect.  Robb starts his march while his father is imprisoned, not dead.","What makes you think Cersei and Joffrey would permit that to happen on a neutral field?  

Jaime is NOT around, Jaime has fled the capital after attacking Ned.  WE know he is at the head of a Lannister force, but Cersei and Joffrey do NOT know Jaime's exact whereabouts at that moment.  Hell, Tyrion gets all the way to the Eyrie, survives his trial, and recruits the Hill Tribes before he even finds out that Joffrey is the new King.  

The rebel force is nowhere near King's Landing, and neither is Jaime.  The logistics of this would take quite a bit of time.  Tyrion wants his brother to fight for him at the Eyrie, and it is denied because it would take weeks to get him there, even if summoned by raven.  

In the end, this action also leaves both of Ned's daughters in extreme peril.  Giving you every bit of the doubt that we can make a Blackfish v. Lannister or Clegane fight happen, and the Blackfish wins and Ned is free, the odds of them releasing Sansa are slim at best.  Arya maybe, but Sansa IS the recognized betrothed of the new King.  Ned wins this way and Sansa is a feast for the crows...  

Blackfish *IS* undoubtedly the best answer, I just think with the political implications of Robb's force marching, even a win is a grave loss when you take the fates of Sansa and potentially even Arya to account.",He will be dead in a week,"I had a child of destiny that reached adulthood with 36 martial, 17 stewardship and 19 intrigue and was a skilled warrior. once he became an adult I gave him a county since he is the third child and most likely wont inherit.

Stannis is a blight upon the house, responsible for its ruin.

Robert was the greatest, obviously, and with Renly the Baratheons would have endured and flourished.

Sure, he wasn’t _the true king_, but he was the better suited one, and you know, Stannis committed arguably the worst crime in Westeros by _murdering him_.

Stannis fucking sucks. His snippy retorts don’t make up for him being shit in almost every way.","Renly is responsible for the ruin you mean, he is the younger brother and should have been happy with the stormlands.

He was definitely not suited better thank stannis as king, fuck renly

stannis is GOAT","> Renly is responsible for the ruin you mean, he is the younger brother and should have been happy with the stormlands.

The second half is true, but the first isn't.

There was going to be a war either way, and Stannis would not have won. Renly actually had a chance of winning (I'd argue he would have won, unequivocally), and the Baratheons would have endured.

Instead, Stannis murdered him. Murder is bad enough, but he killed his own brother. In doing so, he ruined any chance he had anyways (which was barely anything), by sending a good chunk of Renly's forces to the Lannisters. That secured him his own defeat, and any hope of the Baratheon family continuing.

> He was definitely not suited better thank stannis as king

He absolutely was. Renly was _very_ good at schmoozing people, and was loved across Westeros. He had the ability to win over the nobility, and had already won over the smallfolk. Stannis had neither, and wouldn't have either, so long as he was 'iron,' refusing to bend.

Stannis is an excellent soldier, but he's not cut out to be a king. The things that inspire loyalty from a _small_ portion of Westerosi that actually follow him is the same sort of stuff that earns (and would continue to earn) him derision and hatred from the overwhelming majority of the population.

That's just his personality, too, it's not even considering his faith! Westeros would never accept their king worshipping a foreign god, particularly not one that burns people alive. Hell, Aegon the fucking Conqueror (with three fucking dragons) knew he had to convert to secure the crown, and Stannis is no Aegon.

Stannis was not better suited to be king. I'll give you subjective opinions about being a better character, but I honestly don't see how someone could argue he'd make for a good king, let alone a better one than Renly. He is a terrible human being.

I think his parts of the story are interesting enough (not my favourite, not my least favourite), but Stannis fucking sucks. He is an awful person, very little about him is actually likable (certainly not enough to outweigh the bad), and he has no makings to be a good king beyond being a good commander. His fans are the worst, too, but that's beside the point.","im not reading that essay.

Who took the IT and banished him?",Century of Blood: Westeros Edition.,"Immediately after this, he got stripped & was just a normal nights watchmen till he died. The title got destroyed & hasnt recovered yet, the north is close though.","Im not sure, he just became a standard nights watchmen & the title disappeared. Right before this happened, the iron throne went into referendum, so what I assume is he got voted in as king just as joffery, or whoever was king at the time, sent him to the wall, so the game just took it from him, & the title got destroyed some how.","You're immortal, yes. I don't know if that trait makes you immortal (it might as well do) but the ""Resurrected by R'hllor"" trait you have does.

I got this with Aegon the conqueror and was 138 years old before 2.0 came out and I started a new save. I’m guessing you’ve been resurrected a couple times right?

Thanks for the answer!",How the hell do you get resurrected? Wow.,"Silent Monster is something you get after being revived by R'hllor magic a lot of times.  It means your character is basically just a living corpse at this point.

It doesn't necessarily mean you are immortal as you need to have a red priest and enough built up magic points for them keep reviving you.  but assuming you take care of that, in theory R'hllor magic can keep bringing you back indefinitely.","Yeah was thinking the same, I murdered my way through essos but a mask makes them forget aha","Just popped up after I got resurrected I think, just came back to this save after playing a different one so not 100% sure.",There’s a chance every time you get resurrected I think,"Yeah I was lol, my husband's keep dying.

I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary but I'll keep an eye out.,Die with a bunch of magic saved up,"Ah right okay, I've recently burnt the head priestess alive do you think thatd effect my chances of getting revived?","Yeah that’d make sense, the resurrected trait makes you pretty much immortal but so does silent monster. You can only die by being beheaded at this point.",Oh so the normal way.,"This happened to me. 
I lived till 129. Took bloody flux to kill me. 
I also had a bodyguard set Robert Strong who lived to 111 but he was crippled+ old age ect.... but every time he died he got brought back as I had converted much of Westeros to Rholler (Burned and healed all possible ) evebtual the massive 100+ year old drogon was my only ally.

Basically, the greater the difference between you and the enemy the greater the chance of you coming out on top: a duel between a character with 150 pc and one with 10 will almost always end in favour of the former; one between a 150 and 120 will not be as obvious",It’s RNG based but you supposedly get better odds if you have a higher personal combat skill,Or at least change it to 98 or 90 percent,r5: My son is 19 years old and has no relationships except with his dragon,Probably because he’s called ‘Jacaerys’,"That’s all a Targ needs, really.",Aegon I be like,*sad Orys noises*,Get him a wife he deserves it,Hopefully in this timeline your wife doesn't have 3 strong kids.,"""Ser Robert Strong""

Cassana Baratheon was the first-born daughter of King Robert Baratheon and his wife Queen Asha Greyjoy. She had an older half bastard brother Bertram Waters, bore by the Lord of Smallwood’s wife after the king’s lustful adultery. Queen Asha would bare Robert no sons before her death and yielded four further daughters. Robert would raise all his daughters to fight and due to her strength gifted Cassana his legendary Warhammer. He also gifted her a dragon egg yielded from his dragon Rune. However, he gifted Bertram his Valyrian steel sword Storm breaker and when he turned sixteen legitimized him and named him Prince of Dragonstone, heir to the iron throne. Up until Bertram’s ascension to prince, Cassana was considered by Robert to be his heir and Cassana would not forget this passing over. Cassana’s dragon egg yielded a dragon Illithinos which she tamed and rode. Due to there martial prowess the King knighted Cassana and her sister Argella. When a place on the kingsguard became available the King offered the cloak to Cassana who turned it down and the place went to Argella. The King refused to marry his daughters if they didn’t want to and Cassana never married, she bore a bastard Arrec. He died of a dreaded plague aged eleven which hardened Cassana. When Robert died Bertram ascended to the throne. Cassana boring ambitions of ruling the eight kingdoms flew to Pyke to the ‘red kraken’ Gylbert Greyjoy. In return for backing her claim in a war for the throne Cassana promised Gylbert her hand in marriage. In the war that followed the forces of the thrones met the iron island forces at Pyke. Cassana on her dragon met her half brother King Bertam in the skies who had acquired his own dragon Greyfyre. However, Illithinos the older dragon killed his brother Greyfyre and Bertam was captured. This allowed Cassana to ascend to the throne, however she refused to marry Gylbert who would eventually side against her the wars to come. Cassana who saw her half-brother as a bastard pretender fed him to her dragon after seizing Stormbreaker. Queen Cassana killed her half brother Ser Humfrey Waters in a trial by combat with her Warhammer. She bore another bastard son, Robert who she legitimized as heir to the throne. Seen as increasingly tyrannical, Arianne martell declared Taegon Targaryen the true king and rebelled yet was crushed with Cassanas might and her dragons.",Very cool!,The second Dance. Sounds like a very fun playthrough!,"I think it’d be cool if whoever Howland’s heir is would be able to reveal it after his death. If you’re playing as Howland and die, presumably you’d end up as Jojen get an event about Jon’s heritage and whether to reveal it to him. Additionally if Jon is dead but he has had a kid including bastards with Ygritte they should get the same events to claim the throne","R5: Robb ACOK start. Robb is killed in King's Landing by Balon Swann (I can't remember which army it was, maybe Stannis' also charging to KL?). Playing as Bran now, Mance keeps declaring war on the NW, in maybe the third war I sent Howland north thinking 'two birds, one stone', except he dies at Castle Black itself. Guess you're just Jon Snow forever now. 

Wider realm is falling to pieces, for RP I decided after executing all the Lannisters in my dungeons to invade the Westerlands to put the Westerlings on the LP hotseat, and won that war. Annoyingly, Robb's son was born after he died, so game flagged him as a bastard, a bastard who ended up being a rival to me, that despite me matri-betrothaling him to my daughter and heir, still decided to launch an invasion of the North as a claimant... and died after Balon Greyjoy imprisoned him.

Once you've defeated Stannis you'll declare war on Tommen and only after you've defeated him you will be able to ""become"" a true Targaryen.

He is commonly referred to as ""fAegon"" f being fake.",Win the iron throne and cement yourself as a Targaryen.,"Well, all fAegon theories aside, in terms of gameplay, if Aegon is a member of House Targaryen, then, given how finicky the realm can be in terms of factions for characters that have a claim on the Iron Throne (*glares at Tywin and Mace starting a faction for Viserys*), if Aegon was part of House Targaryen before he took the throne, it'd cause all kinds of chaos.

Blackfyres are still Targaryens, they just got that label after being shown to be the losers in the fight over rightful claims to the throne.

Also, it was not tracked well. Who knows how many bastards were out there unrecognized.

People theorize Illyrio's wife Serra was a Blackfyre. Also, there was content that was removed that helps make the case: in the chapter where Tyrion is at Illyrio's place in Pentos, Illyrio makes a reference to giving Aegon a sword believed to be Blackfyre. This was removed before publishing though.","There's a deleted scene with Tyrion where Illyrio wants to give Aegon a sword and tell him something important. I think the biggest piece that is known to be canonical is the Golden Company. 

The Golden Company was formed by Blackfyre loyalists, with the express goal of returning to Westeros and putting a Blackfyre on the throne. Tyrion asks why they are willing to support a Targaryen claimant and Illyrio simply explains that they don't care what color of dragon it is as long as they go home. However he also implies that they are fighting for reasons of honor or pride, which doesn't make sense where a Targaryen is concerned. Moreover, Daenerys recalls Viserys feasting the Golden Company to ask them for their support retaking Westeros and the sell swords laughing at him.

There's also the sheer practicality of it: do you honestly believe they switched baby Aegon with a body double before he was murdered? Does that actually sound likely?","You know how there's a less than 5% chance of fAegon getting Blackfyre sword after winning the throne? Rather than leaving it up to near impossible odds, perhaps this is a better solution to the problem. Give fAegon the choice to either:

* Declare himself as a Targaryen. He would become crowned as the legitimate ruler of the Seven Kingdoms. He would be able to rule with a big opinion boost, get some form of diplomatic advantage with Daenerys (making it easier to marry her), and free of any civil war (for the time being).

* OR he declares himself as a Blackfyre and receives the Blackfyre sword from Illyrio. The realm would descend into civil war. Only old Blackfyre loyalists and Illyrio Mopatis (Pentos) would declare for fAegon's side (1).

However Daenerys and old Targaryen loyalists (supporting Dany's claim) (2), Stormlands (supporting Baratheons claim) (3), and Westerlands (supporting Lannisters claim) (4) would all independently declare war against fAegon and against each other, in their quest to win the throne. 

Dorne would either declare for Daenerys (2) or declare independence (5) UNLESS Arriane Martell is married to fAegon in which they would stay loyal to him (1). 

It would become war of the 4 kings / queen. That would make it an extremely tough campaign, but it would be a dream come true scenario. In the end, fAegon's gotta ask himself if Blackfyre is worth all that.","Good point, but I would assume the Blackfyres take great pride behind their name. That is why every single Blackfyre during the Blackfyre rebellions declared themselves to be a Blackfyre rather than a Targaryen when making their claim for the throne. I think it would be a point of pride for Aegon to redeem his great great grandfather's name as he should have been the rightful heir to the throne.","It's pretty different here though. If the Golden Company really would support any dragon as Ilyrio puts it, then why did they flat-out reject Viserys? There's also the fact that it's the only theory that reasonably explains Vary's reasons (he claim he wants the good of the realm, but has caused more chaos then Littlefinger, like how he drove Rhagar and Aerys apart). And there's that line from Ilyrio about contracts wright in blood not gold.",prove it,So there were females who survived?,"Just because a baby may or may not have been switched doesn’t make him a blackfyre. He could just as easily be an orphan of Essosi Valyrian heritage with platinum blonde hair, couldn’t he?","I think that could be a mod, but shouldn't be in base game, as it is the sort of fork in the road the game gives when you're given the choice between canon or player taking a different path.

Ultimately, Blackfyres are Targaryens. The distinction was only made because Daemon weilded the sword and it was used as a phrase of legitimacy, ie they were the legitimate line of the Targaryen family. In a world where there is one Targaryen in the world left, red or black, a dragon is a dragon. I get the RP angle, but there is no legitimate/illegitimate line anymore, just two dragons alone in the world.

I'm not saying any of this to split hairs btw if people want it I get it, I've wanted him as a Blackfyre too.

But sometimes the other available matches are poor due to traits or age. I figured with the Freys, since there are so many, some of the “lesser” or younger children would be stuck marrying bastards or lower-class people if there aren’t enough appropriate matches. 

I’m an extreme novice at this game though so maybe I’m not even phrasing the question correctly, lol.","Not necessarily. Women are considered matured and marriagable when they have their first menstrual cycle. The fact that GRRM makes a point with some characters of having them wait until they're older, suggests most people in this world don't. It's not unreasonable that Rhaella would have had a child at 13. It could have been a lot worse.","No, you are totally fine, I just meant there are multiple things someone would consider a good match in-game - whereas someone coming from just the show and no CK background is likely looking for those prestige matches only. (Like the one Walder got with Edmure.)

There are plenty of quality families with quality traited children to choose from -- and remember, most of Walder's line doesn't need much of a match, anyway, as they won't be anywhere near the rulership of the Twins, or anywhere else, for that matter. :)

From a game perspective, if you played as Walder, you are essentially just looking to get your blood into as many quality families as you can, and the mod creators did an amazing job of adding tons of families in the game, so you'll be fine in that regard.  It is just if you try to marry every kid to a Baratheon/Stark/Tyrell/Lannister/Greyjoy that you'll have trouble.  After all, pretty much every one of these lines is in immediate danger of extinction during the events of the series, so it makes sense.  

Use your in-game search, and I wouldn't worry about the loss of in-game prestige points in almost every instance, especially if the match is getting a great congenital trait like Genius flowing in your bloodline, or if you are securing land or potential lands with them.  

The game does a good job of letting you think critically, so just do what you think best in a Walder playthrough.",">Women are considered matured and marriagable when they have their first menstrual cycle.

Aerys and Rhaella were married when children to try and fulfil prophecy.  13 is still exceptionally young by even Westeros' standards. Go check the wiki out most births are to parents at similar ages to irl maybe a generation ago, between the ages of 19-30.

Paradox should really contact you guys, because i'm pretty sure witch at least 20\~40% of the CK2 players acquired the game because of this mod. They definitely will lose a considerable number of players if CK3 never gets a properly ASOIAF version like this, I know that Paradox probably should have the buy the rights of ASOIAF books or something like that to make this work, but this is the ultimate Westeros/ASOIAF experience of all time, much better that Telltale's games or all the browsers click-baits.

Thanks for the amazing work! This is something special.","Thank you so much, I have like 500 hours of this mod played. Absolutely love it.",Thank you for your work.

I realy enjoy the game and had a great time.,"As it seems there will be a long time in CK3 until we will be able to enjoy this mod, I'm personally sticking to CK2. Also I just want to say, thank you very much for this incredible and completely unique mod. I can't remember the last time I played vanilla, because this mod is so good. You manage to create 300 years of lore each with it's own unique twists and deliver an almost completely accurate representation of one of the most lore-heavy worlds of all time. So thanks to all the devs and hopefully in less then 2 years we will be playing AGOT on CK3.",Thank you and the dev team for your great work. You guys can't get enough credit.,"I just wanted to say thank you for everything, you and every dev here have done something amazing and i cant tell you the ammount of hours of enjoyment your mod has given me, when i think of CK2 i dont think of vanilla i think of this mod instead.

Thank you all from the bottom of my heart <3","No matter what the game of thrones mod will ever be my favourite mod ever for any game. And you've done so much that whatever team decides to take over for ck3 will have an amazing resource to base it off, I'm sure someone will find a way to convert histories, characters and so on with minimal manual intervention.

I don’t touch vanilla.,"It's thanks to your mod that I got into CK2, and for this I will forever be grateful for you and the team behind this wonderful mod.

That's the difference between him and Ned imo","I usually start the game by clearing out all of the issues one by one, then opening my character page and tabbing through the vassals to see which ones like or hate me. This is important info. After that I go to my council and replace anybody who isn't loyal with a high opinion of me. Then I go to my military to see how many soldiers I have, and compare them to lords around me to start considering where I can expand to. Checking their troops is a little unintuitive. You have to go to their character page and then on the right upper side there's a little button for their realm, which will have the troops of the top lord and all his vassals in a little display. I didn't know about that for a while and kept finding myself in wars I couldn't win. Do note though that the martial skills of your commanders/yourself can turn a numerical advantage, as well as baiting them into attacking you on favorable terrain.

After considering all this I think about unpausing.",I usually focuses on finding good councilors and commanders. As well genius women to seduce using Way if Life seduce focus. If you press (.) you'll open the character finder. I set the diplo range to yes and ruler for no. I invite councilors and commanders with High stats in their relevant fields and invite them or send favors to invite them. You can't use favors on Heirs or Councilors or loyal servants. Then I use the character finder to find a women with Good Stewardship or useful parents to make alliances so I can marry her. Then I invite Genius women to seduce in order to make genius heirs. Then I use any children I already have to make alliances.

Resurrected itself gives a few things, of which I can remember it adds 40 to personal combat.

My resurrected Dany has a personal combat rating of 175 thanks to her having Ruthless, but after this getting Brave in a duel, taking the ambition to improve combat skill (she got level 2 of it which is like 40 Personal Combat), then things like Targ armor, a Valyrian Steel dagger...

He did, but that was a different thing.

Thoros brought Beric back by administering the last kiss and that putting fire in him.

BwB found Cat, but she'd been in the water days/weeks, and she was too far gone to with any decency bring back, so Thoros refused. Beric effectively transferred his 'fire' to her, he died and she lived.

Now... I'd say you need to be a red priest or be rezzed and have that fire to give to bring someone back. Moreover Thoros didn't even expect it to happen he was shocked and it reforged his faith. If anyone could do it then there would be cases all over Essos and people would be freaking out.

In this case rather than it being canon I think it's an oversight as the script assumes whoever your Court Chaplain is will be a red priest.

When you save and reload, is the bug still there? Does it only appear on the search character screen, or does it appear on a ruler’s page/council page/anywhere else? When you scroll, are the same characters missing portraits or do the missing portraits remain static? By that I mean, in your example, if you scrolled down one, would Illyrio’s portrait disappear and Petyr’s reappear, or would Illyrio keep his portrait?

I will try and get back to you.,"Btw, which portrait packs one should have to have 100% compatibility with the mod? Any ideas?",Fixed it by buying the mongol faces pack for 99 cents.

It’s the link next to Official Sub-mods. There is a lot of new start date and that’s really nice but keep in mind that the mod is still originally made for the time period around the story of the book so there will be few things that doesn’t fit.

I’m just sick of expansion pack based games, like paradox and the sims, who don’t keep some of the expansion features because 1. It feels cheap and 2. That means their future expansions are likely going to retread the ground the old ones did and it doesn’t feel like they’re bothering with innovating","They've apparently been working on this for four years. I really hope it keeps most DLC stuff in. The only things confirmed to not be in are playable republics and nomads - annoying, but bearable for me if it's just that...","Oh right. I didn't expect them to actually butcher the people of the Eurasian steppes away, that would have been too much.","Remember, they weren't in CK2 at first either.

See, all those features that eventually made CK2 a great game aren't going to be part of CK3 at launch. They're going to be carved off and sold back piecemeal, because **fuck you, give me money.**",I am sure some of it will be included in the base game - probably things like artifacts and societies will find their way in. I think it is fair for them to release a base game and then add to it though. The amount of work that goes into each expansion is massive. Especially new start dates etc - the amount of time it takes to create the history for each county's dynasties etc is insane. Adding them all in the base game would mean development takes years and costs a fortune. Which considering they are already one of the only developers creating games in such a niche market...,"Yeah I just read that apparently most of the CK2 DLC stuff is in the game and more. It could be true, especially if they can migrate the dynasty histories etc. I personally never enjoyed nomads or republics so no issue for me aha","I wonder if they could transfer resources? I'm just wondering why CKIII is necessary all of a sudden.

As long as I can play any religion on the map, I think I'll be happy. But if I have to pay to play as non-Christians, I'm just not going to buy it, having a game with objectively more content.

And this is coming out so soon. How much work have they actually put into it? Did they start right after Holy Fury? That seems rushed, idk.

Or did they begin development while still releasing DLC for II? Were they designing features for II while making III, with no plans to implement them in III? That seems wrong.","I mean, I hope this one at least has the whole map, and that every religion will be playable from the get-go. I feel like it’s be kinda cheap to restrict play to just Christian lords again, and I personally would be kinda sad if they did away with India and China and Sub-Saharan Africa. Hell, I even kinda want it to come with Sunset Invasion so that a hypothetical CK3 After the End could have artistically consistent Native American portraits.","Yeah that’s fair, I probably didn’t explain myself every well there. I’ll be disappointed if all the quality of life improvements aren’t there (which I doubt they’ll get rid of). I fully expect them to add to it with a further like spy expansion and a diplomacy etc and I’ll buy and support them, just if they took the spying for example in the base game for 3, and made it practically the same as 2, that’s what I don’t like. If they take like 50% of the improvements over and then expand it even further then that’s what I would appreciate.

I just don’t like it when developers make the base game of the sequel, barely differentiated from the base game of the previous. Which tbf Paradox are good at not doing but EA and the Sims are absolutely awful at it","TS4 was a dagger in the gut when it came out. I bought it, played for an hour, and immediately returned it and went back to TS3.

I picked it up shit cheap with a combo of sailing and sales, and aside from some really interesting game design choices, it's still disappointing.

I honestly don't know what to think or expect. I wonder if they'll realize how everyone feels about things once Dev diaries start coming, but who knows. Imperator had a shit-rocky launch, and i'm still reluctant to buy the game.

Not who is Robert in relation to other people, but who is *Robert*.

He's a shagger. He enjoys war and has a temper but how much of his later angers are due to being under Cersei's thumb? What happens in a world where Robert is allowed to be Peak Robert?

In this scenario, Aerys led troops and was captured very early on. Rhaegar was raising taxes at the Red Keep so quickly sieging it gave me him, his kids, his wife, his mum.

War over. But it was a war where Lannisters and Tyrells joined the Targaryens, so no Cersei marriage.

It was also a war where Ned tragically died at the ToJ, and Lyanna and her son go abroad. However Lyanna returns to the North days later.

So, what do I feel Peak Robert does? He executes Aerys. Moreover, he spares Rhaegar, having spoken to Lyanna, who he is fixated on. Sparing Rhaegar is the price of Lyanna's hand. Rhaegar joins the Night's Watch and Lyanna and Robert are wed.

But, Robert is petty. And a charmer. He broods on taking everything that could be Rhaegar's. 

Rhaegar's mother Rhaella is seduced. Then Elia. Rhaegar's children are with the Celtigars. Robert by happenstance has a bastard off of one of the Crabb daughters. This comes in handy later.

(Robert has a lot of bastards)

When Rhaenys and Aegon come to the right age, Robert becomes their guardian. Aegon is won over by being Robert's squire in many tourneys. Rhaenys is seduced, and gives him a bastard. Aegon was raised alongside Robert's Celtigar bastard, and matrilinially marries her. Robert marries Rhaenys to his heir Eddard (awkward? yes)

It was Tywin that extinguished the Targaryens with blood. Robert, Peak Robert, did it with charisma and virility. Targaryens weren't wiped out, they were subsumed into the warm Baratheon embrace.

Sidenotes: LP Stannis married Cat Tully and has lots of kids. Renly got Summerhall and married Arianne Martell. Robert had two Ironborn bastards with a Goodbrother lover who I hope become reaving legends. Cersei has Jaime and Robert as lovers. Jaime and Robert are best friends. It's not awkward. Lyanna stomached all this for Rhaegar but came to love Robert. Then fell out of love with him. But in the end one tourney became best friends. They had lots of lovely kids together. Lord Commander Rhaegar died and Robert felt something like a loss. Robert died five months later. King Eddard invited Lyanna's son from Essos to court out of love for his mother. Aemon is matri married to one of Stannis daughters. Cat likes this son-in-law of hers. Eddard is 20 and a lunatic but that might have something to do with his wife being his father's lover, with one bastard between them, and Eddard's and Rhaenys' son and heir being born when Eddard was 15. I guess that's Robert's last laugh.",Gods he was strong then,"""The Hammer is my penis""",He conquered Westeros with his penis.

And doesn't regret it.","its a blessed timeline sadly though, with Ned dead, I can't say its the perfect blessed timeline yet",">Summer vacation palace and wife which will not mind his sexual preferences is also very good deal for Renly.

About 20 years further into this playthough, and Renly has got very greedy. He declared my lunatic Eddard incapable and has ruled for at least 15 years. Eddard in this time spent his hours doing best by his bastard siblings, giving them cadet branches, land if possible, and good matches. 

Rhaenys died, and Eddard had forced on him one of Renly's daughters, in order to cement his control over Eddard. Rumour in court was that removing Eddard formally is a formality coming. But when Renly's daughter got pregnant, she in hubris was open that it wasn't Eddard's son. In a rare moment of kingship, Eddard was able to convince the High Septon to a divorce, and got the imprisonment of her lover, who he ate. 

This event broke the broken mind, but from that break, came clarity. It was only months after this that Eddard broke free from his quarters and was able to storm into the throne room, declaring himself a king fit to rule. Renly's rule was over, and he returned to Summerhall as soon as possible.

Eddard, in his late 30s, now has a life to lead. His heir, Orys Baratheon, is his 'son' but his father's bastard. He has also openly committed murders, so the possibility to send him to the Night's Watch is there, leaving Eddard's trueborn, Rhaegar Baratheon, to rule. And what of Renly? With his misrule and cuckolding daughter? What of Stannis and his faction to take the crown himself? This Stannis who sent his son-in-law and Eddard's brother, Aemon, to his death in a trial by combat. Eddard can choose, for once, his own fate.

As for a war that you were called into as part of an alliance?  You can't get out of it until the war is over.

I read the dev diary when they added this feature. I have posted a link in a below post that includes a dev chiming  in on someone asking this and it includes actual code.

Where the dev says that ethnicity determines appearance and the code reflects that culture affects taming chance","Yes, I understand.

I wanted to learn where I could find the actual code because I didn't think it was possible to tie gfx to any particular game mechanic.

I recommend rolling back to CK2 3.2.1.,"Florents have big ears, freys look like weasels, can't think of any others rn","The yronwoods are said to be blond and have blue eyes, and i think is good for them as they are stone dornish, which look like the andals, they usually lose this look as when they marry other dornish houses. Also the Hightowers coulde use the dayne gfx, as they have similar looks to valyrians. The brackens could use this blackwood gfx, as it said that every bracken have blackwood blood and vice versa, iirc. The lannister branches like lanny and lannett could use the lannister gfx, but they are not important. Another edit: found this thread were people were talking about houses looks, perharps you find anything inspiring on it https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/9wdmrf/spoilers_extended_a_list_of_house_looks/",">we're adding strong seed to the Daynes, Cetligars (both Westerosi Valyrian)

Would it be possible to give Daynes a unique gfx? GRRM has stated specifically that they don't have Valyrian blood and that while valyrians can have violet eyes, Daynes are more like how Elizabeth Taylor had 'violet' eyes (eg very rare example of a deep blue eye).

Also their hair varies more than westerosi Valyrian does iirc",The Volmarks look like they have a strong seed appearance. All black hair,"crakehalls are said to be big boned, not sure how that'd look in portraits though",Ooooohhhh the next update is gonna be interesting. Maybe add strong seed for Boltons giving them white eyes,"The Manderlys seem to usually end up fat, although maybe that's better represented with through the bloodline and trait systems.","So the Brackens seem to have brown hair and brown eyes from my research although as you say they breed a lot with the Blackwoods so I've just given them a new Bracken gfx with strong seed so this isn't lost, Yronwoods having a strong seed to Stone Dornish is a brilliant shout, I'll add it in

This list is exellent - Pipers and Conningtons having red hair shouldn't be too hard, red-gold for Dondarrion seems to also be a continuous trait of the house, I guess an auburn type colour for them is best","Yeah its gonna be big cos its the 2.0 update - it won't be out for a few weeks but here is what we have put in so far, I'll have a think about a Bolton appearance
MBS 2.0
- New greenseer trait added for those who are full on greenseers
- Revamped greenseer system:
- Greenseers now occur 1/1000 skinchangers
- A new landless duchy represents the CotF, it is held by a Child of the Forest greenseer until Bloodraven leaves the Wall, then by a dynastyless clone of Bloodraven from his ""death"" on
- Aged greenseers can, via decision, become immortal, at the cost of being a tree (they can still be killed though)
- If a new greenseer emerges an aged, treebound greenseer can choose to die once their knowledge is passed on
- A greenseer dying voluntarily will transfer the duchy to the new greenseer
- Bloodline for Davos Seaworth, Jaime Lannister, Baelor Breakspear, House Shett, Axel Tully
- Velaryon, Celtigar and Dayne bloodlines now use strong seed and have traditional claims (done by erbkaiser)
- Blackwood, Bracken, and Yronwood bloodlines now use new strong seed ethnicity and have traditional claims
- House Flint split into 3, with each house using own COA that also uses dynamic system, the First Flints use a stripped down version of the Flints Finger Flint sigil designed by aconda, credit for the Widow's Watch sigil goes to @iamgreen04 who let us use it from his old mod. Both cadets can be legitimised by First Flints
- Added two new cadet lines of House Arryn, House Arryn of Eastwald and House Arryn of the Fingers to represent the (poor yet proud cadet branches that Littlefinger contrasts to the Arryns of Gulltown)
- Edmure Tully (""stocky build"") now has the brawny trait
- Tytos Blackwood now has the tall trait
-Some ancient history changes from rereading World of Ice and Fire
- Added some ancient Dustins to reflect the end of the Barrow Kings and the wedding of the last Barrow King's daughter to a Stark King
- Added Gaven Greywolf, Warg King of Sea Dragon Point who was killed alongside his sons with his daughters taken as prizes by the Starks
- Added some ancient Slates first ruling as Kings, then holding Wolf's Den
- Added some ancient Lockes first ruling as Kings, then holding Wolf's Den
- Added an ancient Fisher King ruling Stony Shore
- Added Greystarks holding the Wolf's Den, descended from the brother of a Stark King who married a daughter of Gaven Greywolf (hence Grey) with a new Stark King personally executing the last one
- Added new tourney champion bloodline, create by winning a great many tournaments
- Dawnbreaker BL should now be created by winning W4TD
- Now independent sovereigns can declare Crownlands duchies that once belonged to their kingdom as a de jure part of their kingdom allowing them to reconquer them. The Iron Throne can then do the same to reconquer them
- Duskendale added
- Hayford added
- Stokeworth added
- Rosby added
- Blackwater Rush added
- Kingswood added
- Massey's Hook added
- If the Vale and the North are in separate realms the North can declare the Three Sisters part of its realm allowing it to conquer them. The Vale can then do the same to reconquer them if it has lost them
- Duelist trait added to trait gain
- You might now find an egg laid by Sheepstealer in the Mountains of the Moon (same principle and likelihood as the Winterfell, Red Lake, and Sothoryos eggs)
- Remove House Redfort from House Royce bloodline in later bookmarks, you can still breed the bloodline into your line yourself, you just won't start with it
- Edited the event that removes Webber bloodline from Lannisters so you can acquire it as a Lannister yourself
- Map layout changes
- Changed some provinces to better follow river boundaries
- Tweaked shape of the Wall to match Dance of Dragons Map
- Added some more impassable terrain for mountains in the Vale, the Dornish Red Mountains, the Southern Stormlands Slaver's Bay, and the mountains south of Braavos, as a result there are now more choke points - also Battle of Sumerhall now makes sense as Fells are separated from Grandisons and Cafferens by impassable mountains
- Added new province of Blackwood Grove, once ruled by the ancient Blackwoods, now a province held by the Starks as we are told they hold lands in the Wolfswood. The county is de jure under the High Lordship of the Wolfswood but is held directly by the Lords of Winterfell. The weirwood and village are references to the Crofter's Village where Stannis is camped.
- Added a new island province off Lockport that is part of the High Lordship of Cape Wrath and held by House Herston, the barony they used to hold in Stonehelm has been removed. This also means that House Herston is sworn to Stannis during the Battle of the Blackwater which was not previously the case so Ser Creighton Longbough can fight his ""Knight of the Red Chicken"" (probably a member of House Herston)
- Added a new province for House Shett of Gull Tower outside of Gulltown, it is de jure a part of the gulltown duchy, but sworn to Runestone, I have also created a cadet for House Shett of Gulltown who hold the (now renamed) Gull Tower barony, now Gulltown Keep, in Gulltown proper, they are sworn to the senior branch of House Shett
- Added new High Lordship for House Blackmont
- Moved Crown Crag to the Giant's Lance Duchy
- Moved Heart's Home to the Northweald de jure Duchy
- Made Prince of Driftmark a king tier title ruling over Massey's Hook as well as existing lands. Added event where if not independent or not a close relative or dynasty member of the ruler of the Iron Throne/New Valyria the title is destroyed - this isn't meant to be a true kingdom just a rank of prestige as heir apparent

- Added new High Lordship of Widow's Watch and moved House Overton to their jurisdiction
- Added new Valyrian Steel Swords
- Longthorn can be obtained by Tyrells

- Manbane belonging to Sandoq the Shadow
- The Golden Scimitar a badge of office for the Captain Generals of the GC (based on Harry Strickland's scimitar in the show)
- Basilisk, can be obtained via colonising Gogossos and a dark ritual, finding it also creates a bloodline
- Chimera can be obtained by being ruler of the Kingdom of North Valyria and being deemed by the priests of Mantarys as a worthy heir to Valyria
- Sphinx is obtained by a non nomad ruler of the Kingdom of the Ifequevron who accepts a bargain with the woods-walkers to essentially sign the Essosi version of The Pact pledging to honour the woods-walkers and convert to the faith of the Old Gods
- Bugfixes and tweaks by erbkaiser:
- birth_events: bugfix for the hard pregnancy marker (AGOT Bug), adds West Valyrian strong seed for the above bloodlines.

- dorne_ancestors: added Dayne bloodline
- stormlands: fixed a few knew_robert flags
- iron_throne_events: includes my mod that allows the Iron Throne to remake lost crowns, as well as Joffrey's crown -- as long as said crown does not exist in the world.
- tower_of_joy_events: sets the 'jon snow' flag for baby Jon, and makes his house a cadet line of the Targs.
- unoccupied_province_events.txt: includes my culture changes for colonies:

-if the colony is in the Dothraki sea, it will restore to the pre-Dothraki culture.
- bloodline_artifacts: -made most dynastic armour etc. only able to be worn if someone has the proper bloodline.
- Disabled stacking for all of them.
- Made the Nightwatch cloak able to be worn for deserters
- Made it impossible for a NW to wear Mance's cloak
- Made Rhaegar's harp copy available to poets
- MBS_decisions: -made it impossible to make a harp or Baratheon hammer if you own the original artefacts already",Good!,Holy Cow!

Thus starts the glorious reign of Jaeron the I of House Hoat, King of the Rock.

(Jaeron is a Westerman as he grows up there and only has his father for knowledge on Qohor, but he does follow The Black Goat which was reformed to include The Seven. He is also a true ""Golden Boy"" having inherited his mothers Lannister looks)","One of my houses is

1. House Blackheart

3. Words; ""As Cold as Steel""
4. Ancestral Sword: Quickdeath
5. Traditional name: Jason

7. A stone mason in Harrenhal, Jason Blackheart had the unique ability to perfectly craft rock and marble alike into art. Being hired by many lords and ladies to sculpt their busts and House's Sigils on Castle Walls. Earning quite the fame and money, he bought a keep near the Trident River, adopted the his house's words and banners. He worked his way through and had his son, Jon, knighted by Ser Barristan Selmy in the tourney of Harrenhal. Nearly a decade before he had sculpted a bust for the King Aerys II Targaryen, seeing his demented state, he knew the realm is nearing war. He was met by Hoster Tully, who revealed a plan to overthrow the Mad King in Favour of his son, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, and asked for him to bend the knee. A year later, Prince Rhaegar is declared King of the Seven Kingdoms. The Mad King however, not yielding to conspiring lords, burned King's Landing to the ground, along with House Blackheart's heir, Jon, who had become Kingsguard. House Blackheart is thus inherited by the third child Joan Blackheart. Who had stolen a Valyrian steel sword called ""Poison"" from a pirate lord of House Vunatis in the stepstones, and reforged it into a Darker sword with a Skull pommel called Quickdeath.","1: House Craggarde

2: A blood red Phoenix facing west on a silver/grey field (created and inserted a custom sigil for this character)

3: Born Through Fire

4: No ancestral weapon. If I do obtain a VS sword in a run I usually go with Talon.

5: Traditional Names: Ryon/Daven

6: Ashemark

7: Founder is a bastard and last living son of Lord Marbrand. Landed by House Lannister in Ashemark after the male line of house was extinguished during the Blackfyre rebellion. Decided to take up his own sigil instead of requesting legitimization. Was raised and trained in Ashemark, and left to join a sellsword company after reaching adulthood. Returned to take up arms with Lannister forces during the 1st BF rebellion after hearing Ashemark was razed and plundered by the Reynes/Tarbecks and his father/brother(s) were killed in the siege. Once landed, he holds a lasting disdain against both houses.

This is usually my go-to custom playthrough. I try to keep it pretty grounded and restrict higher level marriages until i reach a certain levels of prestige. Will give the High Lordship of Ashemark to another lord to make it a bit more difficult to raise my status.","I love starting as a custom house but it's borderline impossible to get anywhere in the early game as a count, especially when you're not allowed to attack any of your neighbors without fabricating claims. And even then the liege might tell you to stop.","1. House Nightstark
2. A Black Direwolf with red eyes on a dark grey field
3. ""Winter is Here!""
4. None
5. Traditional Names: Brandon for males, Jeyne for females
6. The Dreadfort
7. Founded by Brandon Snow, bastard brother of Torrhen Stark, House Nightstark was granted the Dreadfort after the extinction of House Bolton. Moving quietly and carefully, and over a century and a half, House Nightstark moved against House Targaryen, assassinating Kings, Princes, Princesses and Commanders. When Lord Jorah Nightstark died after he slew the last dragon, the Nightstark's tricked their Winterfell cousin's into rebellion. As their fellow Northmen fought in the Riverlands, the Nightstark's marched on King's Landing and seized the Royal Family and forced the Royal Submission. Thus, the North gained Independence from the Iron Throne, and thus was born House Nightstark's reputation as the darker, vengeful hand of the North.",How do you add a custom shield of arms? I have the ruler designer but the CoA designer seems very stiff," 

1. House Seablood
2. Black Ship with White Sail, on a Blood Red Background
3. By Our Blood
4. I don't remember if I had a unique one. I know that I took Poison from the family in the Stepstones.
5. Didn't play enough generations for one, but it would have been Urron after the house founder
6. Seahaven(Formerly Sealskin Point, but console commanded up to a level V Castle)
7. An Ironborn captain named Urron Seablood given the former seat of House Farwynd when they moved to the Lonely Light. Became lord shortly before Aegon's Conquest. Reaved and Raided until strong enough to take the high lordship from the Goodbrothers, and kicked them out of Hammer Hall, replacing them with a loyal friend in House Hammerhand. AI mucked up the Invasion with the Targs always going into hiding and not fighting so the kingdoms remained free. Eventually became Iron King, and spread Ironborn control into the Riverlands in Ironmans bay, the Arbor and the summer Isles over 3 generations of Seabloods on the Seastone throne. Pillaged the Free Cities, including Volantis. Sired dozens of children, many bastards amongst them, who he gave land from the summer isles conquests and allowed them all to form new houses in a sinister imitation of Garth Greenhand, was known as Urron the Virile. I believe his successor was known as the Reaver, and after that was the Ravager.

Was a great playthrough, with the goal of using a custom Ironborn house to ensure the Iron Islands remain independent through Aegon's conquest, and become Iron King, spreading the Ironborn rule to as many islands as possible. Had to stop because of version updates making the save outdated, but my Iron King at that time had the coast of the Riverlands from the cape of eagles to the border with the West, the Arbor, Cape Kraken in the North, Bear Island, the entirety of the Summer Isles and I think some of the stepstones as well as the island of Lys under ironborn control, and had just managed to tame a dragon he named Nagga after the sea dragon the Grey King slew, as I think I took a Targaryen woman as a saltwife or something and he had targ blood.  


Not to mention that with all the bastards Urron had, I created probably like 20 other custom houses in that campaign. Hammerhand, Blackrought, Pryce, Horen...","1. House Ebonheart
2. A grey tree on a black field
3. ""Dark words. Dark blades.""
4. Valyrian steel spear ""Ebony""
5. Traditional Stormlander names
6. Ebonhall
7. Robar Ebonheart was the son of a Summer Islander merchant and a Stormlander woman of lesser noble birth. Inheriting the massive wealth his father accumulated as a trader, Robar founded Ebonhall near Storm's End and was recognized by the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands, Stannis Baratheon. Robar was a quick individual, and a talented saboteur to say the least. He was placed on Stannis's council as Master of Whispers following the Battle of the Blackwater. Despite following the Seven, Robar was faithful to Stannis's cause and even had his share of battle in his brief career as a commander. Despite the noble Stannis's efforts, he eventually lost the war and was exiled to his original seat of Dragonstone where he lived out the rest of his days in bitterness. Shireen was placed as Lord of the Stormlands under the rule of Tommen Lannister. Robar was sought after by many Westerosi maids due to his exotic Summer Island appearance, and he had a bad habit of bedding most of them despite being married. He eventually accumulated enough wealth to make an expedition to Valyria. After navigating a maze, Robar found a Valyrian-steel sword. Upon his return to Ebonhall, he had it reforged into a beautiful spear to honor his Summer Island lineage. Robar's descendants would eventually rule the Stormlands and through their efforts would place the descendants of Daenarys on the Iron Throne, as they saw the Lannisters unfit to hold the throne.",That's really interesting! Its like an Anti-gardener house in the Westerlands.,"The Black Goat of Qohor replaces the Lions of Casterly Rock! This is really interesting considering the joining of two cultures.

Thanks for partaking!","You usually come across existing animals and dragons. But the thought of a phoenix as a house never crossed my mind! Really cool.

Thanks for partaking!","best approach is to build you alliances. Once you obtain a decent amount of prestige you can do a lot when you start acquiring stronger allies. Imo starting as a count makes the game feel more satisfying when you actually do advance up. 

Declaring war as a count has more at stake, so you really need to choose the best times to push your claims.","Yeah they are really hard. What i usually do is invite a courtier with high diplomacy 16-18 easily found. Once claims are fabricated, i wait for my liege lord to go to war. Ideally trident as both Robb Stark and Robert Arryn have a claim on it, and they will declare war one way or another.","Damn man.

I had also married into the tullys in the start of the game and completely forgot. Hoster and Edmure died, leaving Edmure‘s daughter as Lady Paramount, who was married to my Eldest son(not matrilineally), . I also got claims on the lands of the Mallisters and Entirety of the stormlands. which meant that my grandson would have claims on the iron throne, stormlands, and inherit Harrenhal, Riverrun, The Trident, Storm‘s End, and Seagard.",It's more...the Nightstarks do all the dishonourable stuff so the Starks don't have to.,"I had that mod for a while but the hideous CoAs random courtiers got bothered me too much so i got rid of it.

But yea, I think I remember telling a friend that Urron the Virile had spawned like 29 cadet branches. There was a Seastark one off a Stark girl salt wife, House Horen was a son who married the last living member of House Hoare, seeing as many of them died in battle or I had them assassinated to remove their claims to the Iron Isles. I could call on over 50k troops by the end.","Went and checked and was able to load the save even though the map was messed up on it. Not counting House Hammerhead and House Blackrought which were founded by unrelated courtiers and House Roseworth which was founded by the Bastard of a Florent woman who was impregnated by some other Ironborn, House Seablood founded 37 cadet houses that still had living members, all of which carried the bloodline of Urron the Virile.  


As follows for the cadet Houses:

Reeves, Kindwill, Dearborn, Krackell, Horen, Nett, Greytorch, Bloodshore, Drain, Breakstone, Valkyr, Stayr, Darken, Bearing, Seawolf, Redwave, Camp, Price, Ottaring, Pilfer, Redshett, Cleftjaw, Gonmore, Deadwood, Grins, Myre, Swirl, Falsh, Killorn, Grix, Sheer, Bloodknot, Notting, Skaggil, Yellowhead, Treader and Waveweaver.  


Reeves might be my personal favourite of them, as within that house were multiple acts of kinslaying to take power or remove a rival family member within the first two generations of their existence. For whatever reason the AI for that family was extremely bloodthirsty. Valkyr was nice too as it was founded by a bastard daughter who managed to become a Formidable Fighter, so obviously its named after Valkyries."," Hi getting, I'm Dad!","Considering how the new version of the mod has come out, you really should try it!

Well tarth can still be a really good naval base of operations(or do they have a land route thingy?)

In one of my games i played as a Bolling and claimed the stormlands, restored the Durrandon dynasty and placed westeros in a pre-aegon time period. These are really fun.","Tarth does have a straight that it can cross. I was disappointed when they lost 2 counties on the mainland and become a one-county duchy. This was offset by 2 (maybe 3?) tier 3 baronies that were added. I dont disagree with the pirating, just not sure if I want to do that or not. 

They are indeed, they add some more depth to the game but I always end up consoling claims since you can only expand once which I understand but would that REALLY stop someone if they are on a conquest streak? 

In my House Spicer game (same basic princple as Hoat), I did pre-Aegon times and made Blackwater Bay (Crownlands) into an oligarchy ruled by King Monterys Velaryon.","Tarth could easily be overpowered but i guess thats how the game works.

I agree. Westeros has no rules, when you play the game of thrones you either win or you die!

How did my genius heir die out of no where? How did i lose my freehold in volantis? I just use console to avoid going and reporting these issues again and again.

The Lannisters kept sending stacks of men into my capital on the Stepstones while I organized, they lost so many armies down there it was unreal. It was a cake walk when I got my fleet ready to sack Kings Landing. My allies took the blunt of the damage.

Other fun points from my playthrough:

* The Harstarks won against the Boltons/fArya and reclaimed the North. For those unaware, the Harstarks are a cadet dynasty of the Starks added by More Bloodlines. Rickon ended up as LP of the North and Aurane's loyalest ally post-war.

* Jon Snow is still LC of the NW. Stannis is his heir.

* House Tarth is about to go extinct as Brienne is still celibate and her only brothers are bastards with their own houses now.

* Gendry killed Arianne Martell

* Robert Arryn tried to do a slave liberation CB when he was of age against me when I was still in the Stepstones. He got fucked to say the least. His lords rose up against him mmid-war to depose him and install Harry the Heir, who was married to Sansa (who died).

* When I became King of the Seven Kingdoms, slavery was legal as a result of my time in the Stepstones. I tried to outlaw but the Lords voted *against* it. Outlawed it again a few years later.

* I play with the more traits mod or something and one of the events made me a genius.

Westeros would never accept their king worshipping a foreign god, particularly not one that burns people alive. Hell, Aegon the fucking Conqueror (with three fucking dragons) knew he had to convert to secure the crown, and Stannis is no Aegon.\n\nStannis was not better suited to be king. I'll give you subjective opinions about being a better character, but I honestly don't see how someone could argue he'd make for a good king, let alone a better one than Renly. He is a terrible human being.\n\nI think his parts of the story are interesting enough (not my favourite, not my least favourite), but Stannis fucking sucks.
