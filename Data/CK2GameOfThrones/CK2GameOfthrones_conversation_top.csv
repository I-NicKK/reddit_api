Haha,MILK DOES A BODY GOOD,"This man played the game right and lived. Built up stronghold defenses, didn't pursue conquest of neighboring territories, maintained diplomatic alliances by sending out a token force when receiving a call to arms, and focused on developing the Falconer trait until all the external wars ended.","Too bad it seems like he’s still an idiot, but it looks like Lysa has fucked him up for life. If only he could have gotten his hand on some giant’s tiddy milk instead of Lysa Tully’s",I thought maybe it was the Harold dude who inherits when Robert dies lol,Apparently titty milk at 8 is good afterall,I'm so surprised he made it after all the things going on.,I saw one comment mention his appearance being the result of late stage breastfeeding. I was satisfied.,I had no idea who that wad supposed to be until now.,"Objectively at most a 7/10 
Prove me wrong","Ahem, 15.",Too bad he didn't show up bald and with a double chin.,glow up,Yeah even in middle school mother fuckers were flying through the moon door though,He's still her first cousin. Probably not what she wants to do. Marry someone lower than yourself and have your kids take the Stark name.,Who isn't saying it though?,I had to Google to see if it was the same kid. That guy really changed. Like damn,He literally says one word in season 8,He continued to commit his troops to Winterfell despite the death of his stepfather.  That was a solid move.,It’s good at 28 too,I gotta call my mom lol,Yeah it took me a moment too to remember the guy speaking at the council was Eddy Tully.,We judge him relative to how he looked when we first saw him.,*mother suckers,Never going to inherit the Vale like that,He just seemed to zone out and stare at nothing as the other lords spoke..I don’t know if that’s the actor or the character but I took it as Sweetrobin still being kinda clueless about his duties as an LP,Aye,I just assumed that was mostly Yohn Royce," 
""Uncle, please sit down.""


Gave me a good giggle.","I thought he was gonna be the one to propose a Republic, but it ended up being sam.","This lol, [I was like](https://youtu.be/uP1kgYDsqTY)",No one has yet proved me wrong. Hes not bad looking. But people downvoting me because him being a 7 makes them a 5. Which is realistic most people are 4's 5's and 6's,Why not? It's not like feudalism has been a thing for the last couple of seasons.,"You are right but it has only been one or two years at best since Sansa and Littlefinger left him to be warded by Royce. He already doesn't look as sickly anymore. In a few years, Royce could potentially form him into a somewhat decent lord.","To be fair, that's better than Yara ""I forgot my motivation for joining Dany"" Greyjoy.",How could you not zoneout during this season?,"Royce's are running the show in the Vale no doubt, just as the Hightowers are in the Reach.

Idk what the hell they're gonna do in the Stormlands or Westerlands though. Did Brienne end the Tarth line as one of the other big houses in the Stormlands?","I felt so bad for him, but at the same time I was like “what even gave you the idea that you may have any sort of a chance at winning this ?”",U ok mate?,"I mean he look ok, he’s not like a model or anything, nothing to write home about, but he did come a long way from season 1.","We're an elective monarchy now.

Negative opinion modifiers be _damned_.","Considering how disgustingly clean the borders of Westeros are, feudalism never was a thing there.","HOUSE ROYCE FOR THE VALE DOWN WITH THE ANDAL SCUM

Ahem.. excuse me",Well isn’t it implied that Littlefinger was poisoning him?,"I mean Gendry should be the LP of the Stormlands now, but who knows how many of the houses will accept him. And maybe someone will remind Tyrion that he’s the rightful Lord of Casterly Rock and LP of the Westerlands.","Well he is one of the few (last?) great lords that didn't just exit childhood or have a terrible history of murder. So there's that. 

He did defeat Tywin/Gregor in battle. Plus, he's one of the few that protects his smallfolk and did protect his family. TFL",Shooters shoot. That's why.,He must've thought he had 4 guaranteed votes from his nephews (who barely know him),He had just as much of a claim as Bran did,Yet to be proven wrong. Are people saying hes an 8/10. Because i can post objective inages of an 8/10 to compare with this 7,So hes a slightly above average looking guy. Thats the story.,"I’m did a game last night where I just observed. Where Lord Monford Velaryon somehow won the war of the 5 kings and after 4 years of rule he died to some random courtier in Essos during a trial by combat.

Then the Iron Throne became an elective monarchy and now a one eyed Littlefinger sits on the Iron Throne.","The north isn't though, is it?","Civil wars do wonders for borders.

Seriously though I think it was more a type of managed feudalism where the high lords ensured their subordinates didn't gain too much power and the kings kept the high lords in check.",Make a move and the Graftons will show you your place once again.,"Yea, in the books. I was talking about show Robert/Robin.","Gendry probably going to do okay. They all loved Robert and a healthy number died with Stannis

Tyrion on the otherhand is a well known Kingslayer and Kinslayer. Forgiven by the Queen/King or not that's a huge cultural taboo the Westerlords probably wouldnt accept",He was basically the only good person left alive other than Davos. And they just treat him like he's an idiot. What a rewarding ending.,So what you're saying is... the CK2 mod wrote S8.,"Hah!

How do you think I fund my rebellions? Gulltown is quite the prize.","Which king did Tyrion kill? If you consider the love Jaime had for him, he propably told everyone that Olenna poisoned Joffrey the moment he walked out of that room.

As for the kinslayer, i dont know, Tywin didnt really make many friends in his life. And i believe in the fan theory that Tywin was in the privy because Olenna poisoned him as well - with a diarrhea inducing, dehydrating poison.","Yeah, he's not a monster or anything, he just isnt a very capable guy, that's all. Think of him as a guy with the Kind and Trusting trait, but low base stats and a 0 in intrigue. A nice guy to write greeting cards to twice a year, but not who you want to go partying with. And especially not someone you want to lead your country.",They tried to give Sansa an Olenna moment and it missed the mark completely.,"“If you think this has a happy ending, you havent been paying attention”

I get not liking the plot for the writing, but the broader arcs (king bran, cersei-jaime death, jon the kingslayer) all were pretty solid for the tone of the show",The CK2 mod probably could’ve come up with a better plot tbh.,"Last time I checked, the once would-be runekings were my most subservient vassals after they lost their holdings, their armour and their pride and got reinstatted by my ancestors as petty lords, stripped of their vassals. The lands of the Gulltown peninsular forever sworn to House Grafton. House Royce remembers whose mercy they owe everything, who they owe their allegiance to.","People of Westeros hate kinslayers


https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kinslaying


He's so fucked, the lannisters of lannisport will probably replace him","He had a public trial for Joffrey's death and was found guilt via trial by combat. People take that very seriously

As for Lady Olenna telling Jamie. He's saying an old woman who's house he just destroyed dying words where a revelation that exonerates his brother. Jamie is also a known Kingslayer and is known to have released his brother before he killed their father. Ain't nobody taking him at his word.

That's an incredibly silly theory. People shit without being poisoned. Even if it's true they cant exactly run a toxicology report on him",I believe he’s referring to the death of Joffrey. It’s never revealed in the show that anyone figured out who killed Joffrey and now all the people responsible are dead so no one ever will.,"I think of him as a nice guy to have as a confidant or share a drink with, not to elect as leader, even as an LP I think he’d be beloved by the court and the smallfolk but would never really be someone as legendary as Tywin or Robert or even Robb Stark. If he was a character he’d have Kind, Honest, Brave and Family Person as traits.",Easily,"I love how much agency we have in this game 😍😍😍

In mine you guys are all gone, your lands making up my personal demense.","youd think so but the last few seasons have shown different, cersei killed her uncle and cousin, euron openly declares he wants to kill his niece and nephew, ramsay kills his dad stepmum and half brother and all of them still had support.","Yes it's revealed in the show, Olenna literally says it to Jaimes face that she did it. After the Lannisters capture Highgarden in season 7. Remember?","I mean, Edmure is never going to abuse his son to the point of being murdered by his own child. He's not drinking or whoring himself to death. And Edmure didn't ever break his betrothal or execute his vassal unnecessarily during wartime.

I think I'd rate Edmure higher than those three. More successful in both living and in having descendants at this point.","True, i befriended generations of Royces when I was building up my seat to avoid being eaten up by them. So when they lost Runestone and descended to mercenary captains I felt that I had no choice but to spend a lot of time to save their dynasty and reinstate them and they have been loyal vassals ever since. That was my first AGoT save. Unfortunately that save is incompatible and the version it was played in was the one with the massive lags. 28 second lags every month.","Ramsey lies about his father and strongly denies having a hand in it. He's ruling by fear and cant risk being known as a Kinslayer

Euron is Ironborne and they very clearly use a different playbook for whats socially acceptable. 

Cerci blowing up the Sept of Baylor is suspected but nobody is actually certain. Youd also think a super religious country would be a tad upset about someone blowing up the Pope and Vatican. If they actually know and dont care that's a Kansas size plot hole",Revealed to Jaime. That doesn't mean he told anyone but Cersei.,My bad. Then I have no idea who he’s talking about,He will be groomed for command.,That’s the only skill that can reliably be taught in my games. If I differ from it they get 12 stewardship or 8 intrigue as their education,Every time. Of course I usually only play Iron Born so it's fitting,You will be a soldier and you will be a soldier and you will be a soldier!!!,I hate this for how accurate it is I always end up with 9 kids who make The Hound look like a puppy,"This actually reminds me of something in the books and something I do in my games. One of the things about Ned and how he's not the best ruler (even though he's a pretty fair and just ruler) because he wasn't trained to be a ruler. Ned's older brother was the one who went with Rickard to deal with political matters, while Ned was trained more for being a soldier so he's always out of his depth. That's how I used to do my immediate family until way of life: Oldest is Diplo or Martial so they can inherit and be a ruler, Second is a Soldier, Third is a Steward, Fourth is Clergy, Fifth is a Spymaster since they're not likely to inherit.",Relatable af. Prolly because Struggle upbringing is just so good,Well done you made me exhale a moderate amount of air out of my nose. Here's an upvote.,Are there even other educations then martial?,Me to my sixth son: What's your name?,In my Aegon the Conquerer playthrough I like to groom all my kids for a small council role. My government is made up wholly of my family.,"Naw, I almost always make my heir ready for statecraft. Haven't had the general lack of success from the Maesters educating that I see others have.

Rest have to get ready to lead troops!",r/BobbyB,"""Hope you like struggling""","Me to my children:
You'll be a spy/heir. And you'll be a steward. You females will be sold off for a non-aggression pact and a dowry. You'll be a maester. And finally you will be a soldier. And if there are more, to the wall with you.","Literally, it's really easy to just make a militaristic family",Damm this post blew up.,"Not the daughters though, they get a diplomacy education.","Diplo diplo diplo

Maybe a few intrigue to invite to plots.

Soldiers can be imported with 15 gold.",*Gets crippled trait*,"Eh I usually train like 3 (outside of my intended heir) to train for soldiers, usually the strong ones. The less than ideal boys get used for Diplo with vassals. Same thing for like every single daughter.

The Diplo benefit is honestly like the best part of having 14 kids","Must be nice, even with the best teaching my heir he usually gets a max of 10 in every stat so when I play as him I just console the education level I think he should’ve gotten, level 2 or 3 most of the time","Low intrigue isnt that much of a problem, with the spy focus you get so many stats and events it adds up. Same with the seduction focus. I love doing my first two sons as intrigue and the rest martial when playing a vassal.",Is it fun to play Iron Born? Do i need the Reaper's Due DLC?,Fitting user flair,Fifth becomes a lot more likely to inherit now they're your spymaster,"*First to the court*

*Third to the church*

*And pray for no more*","I really never understood why the eldest child was exclusively groomed for leadership and inheritance when the mortality rate was so high.  Just looking through my own family tree, there were plenty of second or third sons who became lord of whatever because their older brother died in battle or from some terrible disease.",No problem.,Who named you? Some half-wit with a stutter?,"How have you managed to have any kids! When I played as Aegon the conqueror I was at war too long and the wives started off too old to get a decent number of children 

Just bad luck i guess",There is no spy education though...?,A child has the base stats of his parents so even a genius with 0 base stats will be garbage,"Iron Born are the most fun IMO because you get to raid and just steal other people's cool items (and indeed people). There are some cool events for them in certain bookmarks, they get their unique Kingsmoot succession law. Best of all you get to drown your enemies for the Drowned God.

It's a challenge because unless you change religions it's very difficult to get marriages to powerful allies because of the infidel Malus (it is doable though as on my most recent playthrough I secured an alliance with the Tarlys who had control of the Stormlands)

I definitely played my first Iron Born game before I had Reapers Due so I don't think it's vital but I'd have to double check what features it actually adds to the mod which are relevant to the Iron Born",You play the Iron born a bit like vikings. Raiding westeros or like I love to do essos's free cities. Nice way to get a lot of items and build up a raiding empire.,">I really never understood why the eldest child was exclusively groomed for leadership and inheritance 

In real life or in fiction? I'm not sure it was *so* exclusive in real life, though I'm no expert.

Anyway, there's some reason for it - the better and more attractive of a leader you make your second son, the harder you make things on your first son upon your death (possible succession crisis for him or his own sons, etc). If you somehow knew your first son was guaranteed to live to age 80, you'd actually have some incentive to make your other sons less attractive leaders (though better for other roles). The trade-off is that in the event your first son doesn't make it, then you're in a worse spot.","Heir and spare. I always groom my second son identically to the heir. If the heir dies, you're still in perfect shape. Third son is the soldier. Subsequent sons are soldiers, stewards, or whatever else I need and they're suited for.

Of course, given my luck, the second son usually turns out even better than the heir. I then spend their entire early years hoping that the heir dies off so that the spare can inherit. He never does, though, and will always live to a ripe old age with many horrible children of his own. Pretty realistic overall, I'd guess.","The mortality rates are highest while they are infant/young child, if the oldest died then, well then you'd have a new oldest who would be groomed for leadership. If you raise multiples for leadership, multiple will want leadership and fight amongst themselves, possibly destroying the family over it.",">when the mortality rate was so high

Pretty sure the mortality rate was only high around infancy. For those that survived infancy, most people would end up living to decently old ages.","you kinda have to stack fertility bonuses with aegon. immediately set family focus, and choose the have a son ambition. once you have a son, choose the have a daughter ambition. then choose the ambition to have five children if you dont already. I play the aegon start more than any other and never fail to have at least five kids doing this.",It usually takes me like a decade to get Visenya and Rhaenyra pregnant,But once I start having kids they come more regularly. Just the first kids are the hardest to get,"In the run I'm doing atm, aegon had 3 kids with visenya, and the 1 son died so I divorced her and married a greyjoy that was half my age. Had 5 more kids including a genius and 3 sons",There is no spy early education. So go with thrift and set your child's guardian to the best spymaster in the realm. Then when they turn 12 set them to train in intrigue. Intrigue leaders are so OP so long as you don't go overboard with negitive traits or your realm will hate you and you lose your ability to recruit people to plots and arrange valuable marriages.,"Intrigue
If you don’t have the Conclave DLC it won’t show up for you",But I don’t know how to break the cycle is the problem,I turn on inter-faith marriages anyway because I don’t think it makes much of a difference to the westerosi. Catelyn was the seven and Ned the old gods after all.,I just forced marriage lol.,House Drumm wants to know your location.,"And all that said, being a trained general is hardly a bad qualification for political leadership, either. There are a lot of transferable skills.","I was talking real life and fiction, but yeah historically a lot of 2nd sons would go into the clergy.  I get the whole trying to prevent a succession crisis, just seems like they're putting all their eggs in one basket.","Lol too true... I've played so many games where I'm waiting for that wretched first son to die so the 2nd can take over, only for the 2nd son to get maimed or depressed, while if I had just put that same effort into the first son it all would have worked out.","Mortality rates were definitely higher for infants and peasants, and it seems to have varied quite a bit depending on exact location, occupation and time.  I get all that about not wanting multiple competing claims, but how much did that actually help versus hurt?  Even without being groomed for command, plenty of 2nd and 3rd sons or brothers or cousins and even people with completely made up claims have historically started wars to gain a title, so it's not guaranteeing anything.

I get the idea behind it, I just think it seems like a really odd practice.  If I had 3 children and only one of them could run my estate when I'm gone, even in today's modern society with very low mortality rate I'd think it completely stupid to only train that one child in how to run my estate, because they could be struck by lightning tomorrow.  The nobility of the time must have REALLY been paranoid about a succession crisis.","This is usually what I do on other starts - the stacking bonuses . Always play for 5 kids minimum with the first ruler

I feel like something isn’t right with my two wives - perhaps I don’t have enough DLC

One is considered a concubine mechanically rather than a wife which might be an issue

As an aside if you play that start regularly how do you vary it?
(I know when I did it I took much longer than real Aegon to complete the conquest but did take dorne - the main weakness of ck2 is battles taking around a week to resolve which is unrealistic )",That happened in mine,"After Visenya or Rhae spit the first one out they start having one every year each

I won't complain about Targaryen courts in Kings Landing Dragonstone Storms End and Pyke","What is this train part at age 12? Is it from a DLC? This is not something I am aware of?

I assume early education is the “will be educated at court” etc - which I believe is from age 6

I seem to have missed a key part of education !",Oh an why are they OP?,Isn’t this a focus though ? I need to go and check my dlc now,I heard there is an exploit if you burn kings landing down but I’ve never tried it for fear of daggers to the chest,"Marry for high stats and alliance first so your character and country are strong then marry/seduce for genetic traits once you're powerful. 

And make sure you look for base stats not stats after traits.",Marry lowborns with high base stats.,"Yeah, although I actually think Old Gods and Faith of the Seven can marry into each other pretty easily even with interfaith marriages disabled. My justification for enabling it is that Lord Quellon Greyjoy married several “greenlanders” after his ironborn wife died. Of course there is the annoying side effect of many noble houses becoming intertwined with the Jogos Nhai...",Ideally,"Yeah. It seems like all second sons often get pretty decent diplomatic and martial education in ASOIAF and are always likely candidates to a new castle should their father or older brother gets a new one. Maybe the focus is more on the first one, but the second isn't usually ignored: Garlan Tyrell, Kevan Lannister, Quentyn Martell and even Bran.","There was a much bigger emphasis on the whole Firstborn thing. It meant a lot more. Other siblings were brought up to be able to support them pretty much, because they are the head family going forward. You can even see this in other shows like Medici. I don't necessarily disagree with you at all, but back then, one of them became the head of the house and was 'the family' going forward. The others had to do other things to bring honor to the family name, like becoming a renown knight and joining the Kingsguard, or Benjen decided to go to the nights watch for example, as he was like a 3rd Son. I'm not even sure what Ned would have been at if Brandon was still alive. Maybe still in Winterfell as support? Maybe he would have been down in KL with King Robert and Jon Arryn the whole time acting as an Envoy for the North while the head of the stark family stayed in Winterfell and ruled the North. That would have been interesting to have seen haha.","Yeah it definitely takes a while. If you get super lucky and three or four lords paramount bend the knee you can do it pretty quick though. And it varies quite a bit depending on which castles I accidentally melt with balerion. Aegon's reign can get pretty boring, but once he's gone there's a lot of potential for civil wars and dragon battles that keep it interesting.",It's from Conclave I believe.,Funny enough I was tempted to say break the wheel but I thought it too soon,I mean tbh if someone could make a mod that cut down the diplo distance to like the free cities distance that could make it have a lot better turnouts.,I thought there was one bouncing around but I looked and alas no,Thanks for all your hard work. I have gotten so many hours of enjoyment out of this mod. You're a true gift to CK2 community.,"Rise knuckey, you may remove your helm. You have served the team long and faithfully, every man and woman who owns CK2 owes you thanks, but it is time to put away notepad++ and your validator, it is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service.

You did amazing things Knuckey <3","Damn that's unfortunate, but I understand. 

Thank you for literally the most amazing user modification for a game I've ever seen.","I might as well put this here, that I too will be stepping back and not be involved in a CK3 version of this mod.","> any future patches that are released by Paradox

What about any new books that are released by GRRM? If not TWOW, there will quite possibly be prequels or something. Thanks for all your work!","From the bottom of a Game of Thrones and Crusader Kings 2 fan, thank you for everything.","Yeah when ck3 was announced I was both happy and sad. I was happy that there is a new game to enjoy and sad that the game of thrones mod probably won't be in ck3.

 Reason for this thinking was the mod is big with years of work into it, it would be incredibly tedious transferring stuff over or starting from scratch. I probably won't buy ck3 because I have spent more hours on the game of thrones mod than the base game. 

Regardless thank you for your hard work and I really appreciate you guys taking the time in developing such an amazing mod.",It’s a weird way to thank you but you’re mod literally has wasted hundreds my life thank you so much,Thank you so much for all your hard work over the years. Ive played the AGOT mod more than I have played base CKII. I've always said that your mod for CKII is the definitive AGOT game and I don't imagine any officially licensed product ever supplanting it,"I've been playing strategy games since the mid 90s, been indulging in mods for them since the early 00s. This mod is legitimately the greatest feat in modding I've ever had the pleasure to play. More than that I think it surpasses vanilla CKII and most games full stop. I think it has a serious depth of imagination in how, away from the game setting, the actual parameters of the game were pushed. It wasn't just a brilliant adaptation of ASOIAF to the game engine, but a brilliant piece of technical work in making the engine bring that world to life. I'm not joking when I say this is as far as I am concerned the best adaptation of the world of the books in any medium, yes including the show lol. A purpose built game wouldn't have come close to this imo.

If it sounds like I'm gushing, I am. I've played this mod so much and it's always been incredible fun. Thank you so much for your work on it. The highest compliment I can think of is that I hope GRRM has seen it, I think he'd love it.","You have put *so much work* over the years for this mod. Can you guys imagine the tedium of adding manually each and every historical character and all their traits and histories? No one can fault you for stepping down after so long.

Eventually.",Hey man - thanks for the hours of fun. No other game + mod out there scratches the itch quite like this one.,Thanks for your hard work. The only reason I downloaded CK2 was to download your mod.,So is the team moving on from CK2 after this? Are there any plans for potential content updates after CKIII or will the CK2 version be shuttering down after release aside from updates balancing with final patches?,Dude thank you so much!

The Asoiaf game we all deserved, but grrm and hbo never gave us.","This is the best fan modification i've seen of a video-game in my whole life. Paradox should really contact you guys, because i'm pretty sure witch at least 20\~40% of the CK2 players acquired the game because of this mod. They definitely will lose a considerable number of players if CK3 never gets a properly ASOIAF version like this, I know that Paradox probably should have the buy the rights of ASOIAF books or something like that to make this work, but this is the ultimate Westeros/ASOIAF experience of all time, much better that Telltale's games or all the browsers click-baits.

Also I just want to say, thank you very much for this incredible and completely unique mod. I can't remember the last time I played vanilla, because this mod is so good. You manage to create 300 years of lore each with it's own unique twists and deliver an almost completely accurate representation of one of the most lore-heavy worlds of all time.

And you've done so much that whatever team decides to take over for ck3 will have an amazing resource to base it off, I'm sure someone will find a way to convert histories, characters and so on with minimal manual intervention.

He's got a better aim than Bran.,"> his only ""mistake"" was beating the Mountain at a time when Robb didn't want him beaten.

Hell, Robb didn't even tell him that he wanted Gregor to pass. Edmure actually carried out his orders outstandingly well. The fault is Robb's for not giving him *complete* orders, likely stemming from underestimating Edmure.",Honestly he seems like a tragic character to me. Dragged into a war because his sister he hasn't seen in years randomly arrested another noble. Then when the Starks finally show up after his lands have been ravaged for at least a few weeks minimum they act like he's just another of their vassals instead of an equal lord. He tries to prove himself in battle and gets bitched out for messing up a plan he wasn't even told existed. Honestly he would've been completely in the right to tell the Starks to fuck off with all their nonsense.,Yeah I like Sansa I guess but she has some seriously bad moments in the show. Not even allowing Edmure to speak was such a dick move. And IMMEDIATELY breaking Jon's trust just to fuck over Dany (who had literally just saved humanity at that point) was fucking ridiculous.,"Edmure is constantly shit on for things that either don't matter or aren't his fault.

Missing the shot at his father's funeral doesn't make him a *bad guy.* Christ, since when is archery a requirement for good leadership? And in his battle against the mountain, he seized an opportunity and went above-and-beyond his orders. 

And the surrender of Riverrun? *The war was over*. They had no hope of rescue. The deal Edmure was offered spared the lives of every Tully soldier, as well as the life of his child. 

Then finally, when the lords are meant to choose a new King, he shoots his shot. Best choice? No. But he's ballsy to put himself forward.","tbf in the books Edmure is a bit of an idiot. After the red wedding though he seems to have matured a lot and my respect for him grew immensely.

Used to roleplay a minor character in the Harry Potter series that got me seriously riled up for this same reason. Unfortunately it's in the books for the character to be joked about despite being a one-legged, one-eyed, ptsd-suffering war veteran who was then held in his own trunk and tortured for a year.

Hope this one will rule long and prosperous.,All of the above,Yes.,No joke.  He turned into more of a smokeshow than Neville Longbottom did.,Breast milk does wonders for the skin,He should have been told it was a trap then,"Agreed he isn’t perfect but therefore neither is Robb, if you’re planning an elaborate trap and strategy you should probably let your largest and most powerful vassal in on it. 

Edmure is a just and extremely competent lord, who indeed ruined the strategy but not to any fault of his own IMO. I really always thought that GRRM based him on Prince Rupert from the English Civil War. IIRC, King Charles ordered Prince Rupert (his like great nephew or something) to March north with an army to assure that the City of York does not fall to parliamentary forces. Charles gave him extremely ambiguous orders, he basically said “if York is not yet sieged you need to stay in the north and consolidate power, if York is lost you need to march back south and support my army.”

However, Charles never told him what to do in the most likely scenario: what if York is in the middle of a siege? Rupert understood the orders to mean that he must try to relieve the siege, resulting in the disastrous battle of the Marston Moors and assuring the defeat of Charles in the English Civil War.

wouldn’t you say it’s more the fault of Charles for not delivering clear and concise directions than it is Rupert’s fault for not knowing what Charles wanted him to do? Alternatively, is it really the Fault of Edmure for not realizing there’s a greater strategy at play and deciding to defend his lands and people against an enemy army?","""Wow uncle i can't believe you defended your people instead of letting them get slaughtered and make Clegane fall into the trap i did not tell you about""","Rob’s plan was idiotic. Tywin had a variety of troops, outnumbering Robb 5to1, while Robb only had cavalry and he was in mountainous terrain. Had Tywin not been defeated by Edmure, Tywin would have gleefully passed through the Riverlands, burning Edmure’s land, after which he’d meet Robb in the field and destroy him. He knew his lands like the back of his hand, was loved by the Westerlanders, unlike Robb, and outnumbered him greatly. 

Meanwhile, Tyrells were set to relieve King’s landing in any case. Robb just used Edmure’s good nature in order to shame him into fixing a mistake Robb has committed — betraying the Frey.",Reach forces alone would be enough to stop Stannis.

His father Hoster was still alive so he was merely the Lords son.,"I didn't like Sansa from start to finish of her character development for different reasons. She was just a lame sweet summer child and a dick to Arya for no reason, then she toughened up and became just a dick to everyone.

For fuck's sake, just bend the knee and don't start a fight with the army that saved your ass. It's not like you guys could fight an army with two dragons on top. Just fucking say ""sure we bend the knee"" instead of trying to act like you can even fight for your independence.

It doesn't matter if the North won't be happy with it if you don't have a chance at fighting for it. 

Also, REAL quick to go back on your word and tell everyone who your brother really is.","Of the lords assembled at that meeting, Edmure and Yohn Royce were equally the best candidates.  In fact, if that had been being serious, they were the only 2 valid candidates there.","And, when he misses his shot at the funeral, Blackfish basically went: ""It's okay, shit happens.""","He's not an idiot at all in the books.  Cat thinks he is (and says it often) and because we mainly see him through her chapters, we mainly get her bitchy description of him.

The reason he seems more mature after the Red Wedding, is because we are finally seeing him through someone else' POV (Jaime) and they don't see him the way Cat does.","The Blackfish is the reason The Blackfish died. It made zero sense why he wouldn't get in that boat with Brienne and go North to help the Starks reclaim their home.

He could've gone with Brienne, he could've swam away, he could've surrendered and asked to take the black.

In the books Edmure stalls long enough to give the Blackfish time to escape via swimming away.

Edit: If I had to chose between the lives of hundreds and my newborn child vs the life of my uncle who is old, and stubborn, and kinda a dick to me I choose the 1st option every time.","In the show.



And frankly, at this point?



*Fuck* the show.","She mentioned logistics once, maybe even twice bro shes  ThE QuEeN iN tHe NoRtH!","Didn't realize there were so many Edmure stans here, damn.

Show Edmure is feeble minded and glory seeking. He has no actual experience ruling, having spent the time since his father died either chasing glory on a battlefield (briefly) or in chains. Meanwhile, Sansa was being tutored (whether they realized it or not) by Cersei, Tyrion, and Littlefinger - both on how and how not to govern. And she's actually been in charge of the North and preparing it for winter.","Fine, we'll just go to the [wiki](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Edmure_Tully):

>Edmure fails at hitting the boat three times in a row. Just as the boat is about to disappear around a bend of the river, Brynden pushes his nephew out of the way and skillfully makes the shot.

First real example of Edmure being incompetent. (See also when he goes to sit down and hits his sword on the tent pole during the meeting in the Dragon Pit.)

>After the funeral, Ser Brynden chides his nephew for attacking Stone Mill. Edmure proudly asserts that his ""blunder"" sent Gregor Clegane scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. He says that they will not win this war if Robb is the only one winning any battles, and that there is enough glory to go around. Robb responds angrily and tells him it is not about glory, before reminding him that his instructions were to wait for the Mountain to come to him.

Highlights his focus on achieving ""glory"" instead of sticking with the game plan - most focus on criticizing Robb for not telling Edmure the whole plan, but Edmure had orders and didn't obey them.

>Edmure tells Robb they took hostages, including Martyn and Willem Lannister. More than two hundred men were lost in the battle, less than what the Lannisters lost, but Robb furiously tells him that they need their men more than Tywin needs his.

Classic case of a Pyrrhic victory and a failure to understand the overall strategic situation.

>Catelyn scolds him, angrily asking him if he is willing to risk their freedom and lives for a chance at a prettier wife.

Much like his glory-seeking behavior, Edmure's priorities run towards outwards appearance.

There's really nothing in Edmure's show history that suggests he would make a good king, and it's rather laughable that he's the first one to offer himself as a choice given his claim is solely based on being lord of Riverrun, despite spending most of his time with that title in chains.","Or you have to start as another character, and get lucky. River lords often rebel against Petyr and restore Edmure","I won as Edmure in AFFC, basically I freed myself from the Twins and just stalled long enough for Daenerys to arrive, sided with her, lead the storming of Kingslanding myself and lead the war against the White Walkers.","Euron is the worst example.

* Dorne: House Uller

The Baratheons are extinct, but most of the other great houses survive, just not in power. Although the Starks will die out soon. And Mace's entire line of Tyrells died, which I only rarely see.","I've had Littlefinger win the Iron Throne by pure scheming on several occasions. Easiest way is this. 

Set a plot to kidnap whomever is LP of the Vale and then once they are in your dungeon start a faction to Overthrow the Monarchy of the Vale. You get an instant 100% and can declare yourself LP of the Vale.

If you've read Fire and Blood, you might notice what happened at the Field of Fire. Almost 100 thousand soldiers incinerated by 3 dragons. Reach and Westerlands got completely eviscerated. Torrhen Stark knelt, because kneeling was better than dying and conquest. If 100 thousand soldiers couldn't face couple thousand enemy soldiers and 3 dragons, what better chance do 10 thousand northmen stand? Against 2 dragons and shitload Dothrakki and Unsullied",Yeah I couldn't stand Sansa for similar reasons. Plus we have a variety of characters saying how smart she is yet she never once seems to show it. In fact she spent the entire series being manipulated by smarter people. She kind of reminds me of a not as crazy Cersei convinced she's a genius but really not more than a petty schemer.,BuT do ThEY hAvE GOod StORieS?!,"*The Onion Knight and Gendry, fixed it for you",good point. Although idiot might have been a strong word. He is insecure and a bit vain and she really dislikes that.,"Ok so his archery skills are bad. Pretty sure he could still outshoot Sansa.

The Battle of the Fords was a huge tactical victory, strategically it was a failure, but that's because Robb doesn't even share his plan with the guy in charge of the rest of his forces at that moment. Sansa meanwhile selfishly doesn't share that the Vale might help at BotB, which easily could have resulted in Jon's death and the overwhelming loss of Northmen.

Sansa has spent similar amounts of time in chains, has less military experience, and has basically no statesman feats outside getting help from the Vale, yet she thinks she's a queen. 

I'm not saying Edmure would be a good king, but Sansa was disrespectful to someone who has done little else besides try to fight for *her* family, and suffer for it.

Besides, the whole scene is trash on every level anyways.",I lowkey wish they did Euron properly mystic and menacing except he was still a Jack Sparrow impersonator.,"As it's presented in the story, I'm not convinced that Edmure made a miscalculation. He acted completely rationally based with what he reasonably believed to be all the necessary information.","Rupert was a decent military commander and was respected and loved by the nobility and armies, I compare him to Edmure not because he lost a battle but because both Rupert and Edmure are looked at for “losing the war” but for both it was largely due to lack of good instruction

What happened to the Starks and Mace's entire line?","I'm not debating that but Robb was at minimum the lord Paramount of the North if not KINGINDANORF during his interactions with Edmure so was above him in status.

We don't even know if the Riverlands would've stayed as a Paramountcy had Robb won the war. The individual high Lords might've sworn directly to the Starks.","Once they lost book material they had no idea how to show peoples intelligence without saying ""oh they super smart"". This was done with Sansa ""Smartest person I know"" Stark (coming from a person who knew Tywin Lannister) and with everyone circlejerking Tyrion's intelligence even though hes failed at pretty much everything since The Blackwater and pretty much eviscerated Daenarys army and navy from the inside... on accident.","She's basically an exact copy of her mother.  Thinks she's smarter than she is, assumes everyone is dumber than they are and constantly ruins other people's plans as a result.  

Being an unnecessary bitch to Edmure is also straight out of Cat's playbook.",Yes?  Yes.,Gendry can’t even read,"And I have serious doubts Robb would have pulled off another victory against the Lannisters. Robb would no longer have surprise on his side, Tywin himself knew he couldn't underestimate the boy anymore. Robb's cavalry advantage in speed would have been somewhat mitigated by all the loot he was picking up in the West. Plus, the Lannisters would be fighting in their own country with supplies, new troops, and fortifications ready when necessary.

&#x200B;

Robb's early victories relied heavily on surprise and the home field advantage. All that disappears when he decides to draw Tywin into the Westerlands. I believe Edmure saved Robb's life, or postponed his demise I should say. Robb was making plenty of decisions on his own that sent him barreling towards oblivion.

&#x200B;

Hell, apart from all that, the crown didn't even need Tywin to defend King's Landing. The Tyrells were more than willing to come to the crown's rescue and defeat Stannis.","He *could* have guessed Rob's plan, if he was a tactical and strategic genius. But Edmure's not a genius, he's just a reasonably smart guy. And he did a reasonably smart thing.","Because Hoster ordered him not to fight. Edmure wanted to bring the battle to the Lannisters, Hoster told him to wait for Robert Baratheon.","Show Edmure is an absolutely different character. Also, Robb’s anger with him is ever stupider, than in the books.","Estermont and Tudbury, there are two turtles in the Stormlands.",Yep.,"The Starks just went the typical way of the AFFC start. Sansa married Harrold Hardyng, Jon died as LC, Rickon never had kids, and Arya and Bran were never heard of again. Sansa's descendants will rule the Vale, but the Stark name's gonna die with her.

Mace's descendants met various fates, but overall I'd say it was the fault of - seriously - evil kinslaying tyrant Willas 'the Black'. He's certainly the reason why the Tyrells no longer rule the Reach.","Hardyng isn't a cadet branch. It's because one particular member of it has relatively recent descent from Arryn, so in even of Sweetrobin's death he'll assume the title and name of Arryn.","Oh, I see what you mean.

It was to lead him on a wild goose chase through the Westerlands since Robb's army was entirely calvary. Then loop back around to the Golden Tooth where numbers won't matter anymore. Tywin would have no choice but to barrel straight into Robb to get back to Kings Landing in time.","I know, I was just stating he lost and was captured in his first battle, he made an impressive comeback though.","George loves his turtles, they inspired him to write the books",">Sansa's descendants will rule the Vale, but the Stark name's gonna die with her.

On this note, wouldn't it be great if Stannis or Joffrey/Tommen didn't get the kinslayer trait for killing one another? After all, they aren't actually related.",">It's because one particular member of it has relatively recent descent from Arryn, so in even of Sweetrobin's death he'll assume the title and name of Arryn.

Explain? I've never read the books so I'm completely lost on how this is possible.",How if figured it was the riverlands wernt powerful enough to stand on there own so if Robb won he would have either join Robb's kingdom or stayed with Joffrey's and after open rebellion it wouldn't be much of a choice,"That’s really not how the feudal system works like the peasants are powerless, it’s all about the vassal lords and landowners. gendry can walk up to storms end and claim to be lord paramount but why would all the stormlander bannermen choose to bend the knee to a bastard, who grew up a smith in a different realm,  who has never even _been_ to the stormlands, let alone led anyone or anything? And then you consider that he was only legitimised by a Queen they never recognised or bent the knee to, and whose dynasty they have already successfully rebelled against less than 20 years ago. That’s also assuming that no one has filled the vacuum of power already, and there are plenty of lords waiting for the opportunity after all the Baratheons died, just like after Bobby B died and 5 more kings rocked up

Don’t get me wrong I love my boy gendry but there’s absolutely no way he could hold the stormlands","""We planned to run Lord Tywin a merry chase up and down the coast, then slip behind him to take up a strong defensive position athwart the gold road, at a place my scouts had found where the ground would have been greatly in our favor.""

I get the idea behind Robb's plan and it's a good plan, but I don't think the North would have been nearly so successful in this battle as they've been in others. Robb's army would have lost many of the previously vital advantages they used in the past. No element of surprise for Robb, the Lannisters now have the homefield advantage instead of Robb's army, and the North would be fighting in an entrenched position (though it gives them a defensive position, it also in large part negates much of their cavalry advantage). While they could still have chosen an area suited to cavalry, I think Robb's army would be at a severe disadvantage. 

Tywin was like to defeat Robb, and I don't see him as particularly necessary to defend King's Landing either. The Tyrells have a large army ready to defeat Stannis, they'd already formed an alliance with the Lannisters, and have more than enough reason to want to strike Stannis. The Tyrells were prepared for battle before meeting up with Tywin and did play the most integral part in the battle itself. Robb didn't plan for a Lannister-Tyrell alliance, but he probably should have.","So [this guy](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harrold_Hardyng) has an Arryn grandmother.

Me being the plucky high Lord of the Vale that I was, thought I'd side with the dragons even if I was the only one. Hopefully I'd wind up on the right side of Dragonfire and conquest.

She died of scurvy on the boat over...","My favorite personal case of this (AFFC start):

* Dany dies of illness about 10 years in after doing nothing important.
* Stannis (who lost to Tommen but survived) promptly tames Drogon, takes the Iron Throne, leads his army against the invading Others, incinerates the head WW with his dragon... then just keels over at the age of 60 or so. I can't even remember what killed him now, might have been stress.
* *Then* after about 10 more years of fighting, his 15-year-old grandson Stannis II finally wins the War for Dawn, saves humanity... dies one year later of pneumonia. His little sister gets assassinated shortly thereafter, no more Baratheons. (Succession got even more ridiculous after that but at least it didn't have to do with people dying anticlimactically).","The dumbest thing I have ever seen in the show is the fact that they were able to casually fire THREE scorpion bolts into a a wounded semi-grown dragon AND they were able to kill him. And by the one and only budget captain jack sparrow on crack.  Lore-wise, scorpions only harmed dragons because they were aimed in vulnerable spaces, they weren't medieval themed rocket launchers as the show has clearly presented them as. EVEN game wise, dragons are pretty much deadly when the other side has them, (well as long as their Marshall is high). But it is still ridiculous that they were able to easily kill rhaegal THAT quickly.","Dany is the Kenny of the mod. Whenever I don't play as her she'll die within a year. Which means that random people around the world become dragon riders. That's what I call subverting expections, behold the mighty Jon of House Brax. (He actually took over the Iron Throne too)",SUNSET FOUND HER,"Dany can like only contract diseases and die in any of my playthroughs on any version build.

A shame but he still lives so there might be hope yet.,"The very first time I played this mod, I decided to try Aegon of Essos.

It seems like he has an 80% chance to die of “poor health” right after you take the throne.,"Could be done fairly easily, make a ""canon"" trait with an invisible icon that adds health, then write an event to add it to a list of characters.

Edit: book 5 spoilers","I think food poisoning?

There is a shitty scene","Renly's peach, meet Dany's orange.",Hey don't spoil the next books,"Lore-wise, the dragon killed by a scorpion bolt to the eye was also Meraxes, who was at *least* forty years old, probably older, when she died, and that was to Scorpions almost 300 years prior to the date of the show.

The scorpions pictured are absolutely fuck-massive and thoroughly fastened onto boats, which means they have no recoil concerns.

For historical comparison, the early Byzantines (pre-700s) used ballistae that, according to Procopius, ""would penetrate tree or stone."" They were also remarked as being capable of fully impaling a man through shield and armor. These were developed several hundred years before crossbows (similar engineering principles) were common in Europe, and crossbows are already common in Westeros. Obviously it's impossible to cleanly equate tech trees, but one would expect that if Qyburn's scorpion/ballistae are somehow innovative (as has now been established twice, even with the latter being improved from battle testing of the former) that they would be superior to scorpions that work on even more simplistic principles than the fancy crossbow he handed Bronn.

I'm not interested in jumping to the defense of much about the episode on reddit at the moment, but the idea that a 3-5 year old dragon's scales would be somehow *immune* to the bolts of those monstrous siege machines is crazy.",Why?,God spawn.,"Damn, the commentator in the screenshot is foreshadowing GR Martin's new book",...in which book that happens? I dont remember it.,"No, when drogon flies off with her taking her to his hideout... before where in the show she would be found by the dothraki, she drinks dirty water from a stream or something in the book","Lore-Wise, their have been three instances where a dragon has been killed by the actions of regular men rather than that of  another dragon rider/dragon.

The first was, the bolt that pierced Meraxes' eye and subsequently killed both dragon and rider. The second was when the battle of black water bay when Jacarys Velaryon and his dragon died in the battle against the foreign fleet. The third, was when the dragon tessarion was essentially put down but some archers because he couldn't fly due to a broken wing, a mercy killing essentially.

In all the instances above, the dragons were struck mortally in vulnerable areas, and it was a plausible that they died in the manner in which they did. Rhaegal died in a poor, mock Micheal bay-esque sequence where three bolts managed to perfectly pierce the bodice, the wing and the throat of the dragon. **It was for purely for shock value** and it follows the narrative whereby **D&D wish to ""subvert expectations"".**","Not sure about anyone else but you’ve won me over. Despite that I still think the scene was handled extremely poorly. Also, how do you build scorpions in this mod?","I'm fine with them being able to do the deed, I'm not fine with all three hitting a fast moving target at great distance on a rocking boat, AND Danny not being able to see the iron fleet",he's got low fertility maybe it's linked to that. Has he got stressed? Stressed trait kills quicker than cancer does half the time seeing as you can get good treatment for cancer but no treatment for stress to counter its health drop.,Stannis has low base health to balance out the fact that the Azor Ahai Reborn trait gives him +4 Health.,"He has reduced health post-Renly as a result of making the shadowbaby. The chosen trait helps but not enough sometimes, apparently.","End of ADWD, right before she is found by the Dothraki. Ate berries iirc","Lucky you.

I wish I could forget all her Dance chapters.",Oh,"> Lore-Wise, their have been three instances where a dragon has been killed by the actions of regular men rather than that of another dragon rider/dragon.

You're forgetting the Storming of the Dragonpit when a group of regular peasants with normal weapons killed 4 dragons and directly caused the death of a 5th.","You can't explicitly build scorpions, although now I kind of want to go see if I can mod the Siege Leader commander trait to give a bonus to dragon-killing. ""Siege Weapons"" is a tier of defensive structures, which will indeed affect how likely a dragon is to get wounded/maimed/killed attacking your castle.","Not sure if the low fertility is the reason, but I am pretty sure that he has stressed so it probably does have to do with that. In my personal experience though, that's been less of a problem than cancer, it's near impossible to get someone that knows how to treat cancer.",What the fuck is the point in the trait giving the only current owner of it +4 Health if they just take 4 Health from him anyway?,Does that trait do anything else or does it just increase health?,">He has reduced health post-Renly as a result of making the shadowbaby

Ahh okay, can other people that follow The Red God get shadow babies as assassination tools? I know that they can get resurrected if they wish since I've seen Stannis as a Silent Monster in a few of my games.",Well that's not the pale mare; that's the berries quickening her womb (possibly).,"That's partially true. It wasn't a ""group"" of people, it was a few thousand angry and belligerent peasants and almost every dragon in the dragon pit was chained and quite young (except dreamfyre) who broke free and brought the entire place down on both dragon and peasant alike.

On top of that, Syrax, was only killed because she landed on top of the said few thousand angry peasants (it's implied that the death of the other dragons drove her to do so). Moreover, she didn't implore dragon fire, it was much more 'personal', she fought with her teeth and claws. Much like the scene where the dead swarmed drogon, the peasants swarmed and killed syrax, except she didn't fly, she fought till her dying breath.",It would be awesome if higher fort level castles could build a scorpion defense that gives a chance to kill dragons during an event.,"Sure, I meant more in the sense Stressed is a lot more common, knocks your health by quite a bit, and there's no coin toss to mitigate it. Characters with stressed I find when I play them are often dead within a few years, and it's more common by far than cancer, which I've only ever had a few times.","I think it also increases his personal combat rating, grants him access to R’hollr Magic, and has a chance of him being resurrected upon his death.","You sure can. I typically use one in the ADwD bookmark to kill “Young Griff.” But then I’m stuck in hunting or family focus all game to make it to 50. Still worth it.

But yes, if you start an assassination plot as a Chosen of Rhllor with a decent red priestess, they will offer to do that for you at the cost of 1 or 2 health. 

Ooh...walder frey would be a great azor ahai","Ohh okay, totally agree with all of that!","Random aside, I played with a character who had stressed for 40 years. He was also maimed and healed, then wounded again, and eventually maimed again and ultimately died by trial by combat.

I bought the game five years ago to play the mod, and I haven’t been disappointed.",Dont forget the mount and blade agot mod.,Oh shit we did it bois!,I didn't even know this sub existed. Nice!,There shall be no truer post than this,AGoT Mount and Blade is a pretty strong contender,This mod and the GOT mods for Warband,*Cyanide weeps silently in the corner*,"Game of Thrones is mainly Westeros oriented tbh, so it's fairly accurate.","Isn't that what bannerlord is supposed to be?

I mean

When it releases


Sometime.

Maybe.",I learned about that game because someone on a Spanish ASOIAF online forum was playing Ck2 agot with Tyrion. Now it's one of my favourite games ever.,"Yeah, I bought the game in 2013 when I was still in college. The AGOT mod is the only reason I bought the game, the dlc and continue to play it. I put in an ungodly number of hours that I do not wish to share. I'll just say I'd probably be fluent in 2 languages.","Nah, the Mount & Blade AWoIaF mod is the shit",Is it? I’ve never heard of it!,No Bannerlord is more controlling your guy and fighting in the thick of it. CK2 is leading your house through the generations and rising to power.,I love hearing stories of how people discovered the game. Reminds me of the feeling I had when I first found it and was so blown away. Memories.,I know that's why I am saying dont forget about it.,Isn’t the Clash of Kings one better?,"Allegedly.  If you look up Mount and Blade warband, you'll see the first one.  It's very dated (but still fun)  and banner lord is its in development sequel that's supposed to be, if the Dev logs are accurate,  first/third person CK2, down to forging dynasties and such.


The warband agot mod is pretty fire, but I expect the bannerlord mod (if the game is ever released) to have shit like experiencing the battle of the trident as Robert and shit.",You should read the devlogs.,"It’s funny actually, I discovered the AGOT mod before I even knew what ASOIAF was (I was like 12) and thought that the characters/map/story looked cool so I downloaded it. Then my brother had the book with him, and I was like “hey! wait a minute... that’s real?”","I was having a smoke outside the office back in 2014 or so, and a guy who I've never worked with comes up and asks me if I like grand strategy games. Straight up, no 'hello', just, 'do you like grand strat?'. To this date this is still one of the weirdest icebreakers I've encountered. Needless to say, got introduced to CK2 all because I just happened to have a smoke when he came by.","There are two such mods for M&B: Warband - AGoT and AWoIaF. IMO the latter is better, and I thought you were talking about the former.

Edit: Actually I believe the former is called A Clash of Kings, not A Game of Thrones.","It's down to personal preference. They're both well polished nowadays, essentially that one is more like vanilla (though with all the usual improvements) while AWoIaF is similar to Brytenwalda/Viking Conquest in Westeros. Bettere for some people, others might not like it but either way definitely try both.",Very cool! Thanks for the heads up,"War band is fantastic maybe before I retire, bannerlord will be released",Out of curiosity have you played both games (warband and ck2)? If you have you would know what I’m talking about. In warband you control a character in fights. In ck2 it’s a literally map of the world you are in and besides a portrait of your character you don’t fight in the thick of it with skill more strategy.,They liked the AGOT mod so much they made it a real thing,It's been awhile one was better than the other.  More currently updated.,I will have to do so. I’ve only ever tried Clash of Kings so far.,"I'd pop it in a wishlist on steam or something. They just issued a private beta so I imagine the games not that far off, but it's one of those games by a small studio with a virtually unlimited time they can spend in development and they've milked it for like 7 years now, but some of the recent Dev logs make it seem like a fully fleshed out living medieval world with personal relationships and such.",And you'll know that bannerlord is different and the same if you read the devlogs,"A while ago ACoK was much more polished, but since then both have become well polished so it's more down to personal preference of gritty vs a more vanilla experience. Both have a load of content.",You trying to tell me... that in bannerlord you can’t control your character in fights like in warband. There is no more entering towns and walking through the marketplace and lords hall. They completely got rid of their multiplayer system. Now all events are through note pop ups like in ck2. And you can lead armies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers in numerical battles rather than skill like in warband. If you have played these two games you know they aren’t that similar in gameplay.,Be nice if banner lord 2 would finally come out so they can mod that haha,"No. I'm telling you it's that and more.


Read the fucking devlogs you craggy headed fool.",No need to be rude I’ve read every dev blog and none of them are indicative to lead someone to call these two game extremely similar. I’ve played both games with over 3000 hours between the two. There are some similarities yes you can own land and such and be a vassal. But both games focus on different spectrums. Warband and Bannerlord focus on individual combat on a relatively small map compared to that of ck2. Ck2 focus on the social hierarchy structure with hundreds of Kings and thousands upon thousands of vassals and various land owners. Compared to the hundred or so noble characters in bannerlord that is a lot. But the ck2 doesn’t have Bannerlord RPG elements which are 50% if not more of the game. I’m not going to push this further as you clearly have not played one or both of the games enough and you are becoming rather hostile.,No need to be an idiot.,“Even now I could dribble past all of you like carving a cake”,deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.0722  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/26786),I'm not proud of how long it took me to get this.,"Posting this here too, because not sure if someone's will respond.

2. If you are on your liege's council, accept any request for support to get some favors (most importantly the ones from stronger counts)
3. If you are playing count under duke (which most of the time you do), try to press claims on other lords under the duke to expand your territories so you can get more levies. If you take all counties possible, start fabricating claims for dukes counties. After getting claim, start faction for pressing your claim. Invite anyone if still left to your faction by using favor. Use faction to take every county from your liege, until he has none left. If you control all territories in the duchies, you can automatically create the said duchy again for free, making you a duke.
4. When on duchy level, I do many different things. First if it is possible, I will start intermarrying with the dynasty controlling the region, so my later generations could fabricate a claim on Kingdom. If that doesn't work I will continue to expand my territories to other duchies on the region to expand on my levies. If you don't want to wait for the other generation to take over, you can also get as many favors as possible from council support, fabricate a claim (it is best if it strong) on the capital of the region (e.g.. Winterfell), take it over, and fabricate a claim on the kingdom itself.

I think I know a lot about the history now, also started reading the books, but for whatever reason I can't REALLY get into it, other than reading it on vacation.

Grey Worm was adamant that Jon be held to account for Daenerys' death and is the one character left most motivated to avenge her, and now with no legal or emotional obstacle left. But he just agrees to Bran becoming king, without ever having really known him or having any motivation whatsoever to name him king, and the Unsullied just accept Jon being sent to the Wall and sail away from Westeros. How does that make sense?","Yeah, but that’s the nature of regime change. Arya voting doesn’t really make sense, but in theory house Tarly and Tarth are relatively important",I would add the population of Westeros is similar to that of the HRE at times,"Or ""Obedient ++++++""

""That was an option? Okay fuck all you guys we're going home""

Why do they even care about Jon or Tyrion","The Tarlys are claimants themselves even without Florent connections

I was kinda disappointed by the whole 'I will diminish and go into the west' routine.,"Edmure's has no indication of having any power in the Riverlands - Tyrion too has none in the Westerlands. The Reach also didn't vote, and I don't recall a Martell voting.

Either way, that's at least three Kingdoms that did not vote, not to mention the fact that all the rest of the Lords are probably pretty annoyed for not being allowed to decide.",Basically like bran has access to the console and have a glass candle/dragon dreams to find all plots against him,"No, they were returning to Dorne to pick up the army when they got attacked. All their troops are still at home, though maybe there was an off screen civil war that depleted their strength.","The ending made a reasonable amount of sense, it was just the rushed buildup that made it feel unfulfilling. I would doubts the books end in a very similar way if they ever come out, GRRM did supposedly reveal the ending to the showrunners","Well technically ||he died and once you die your watch is over.|| Idk if there's code to actually take this into account but it's an interesting technicality. 

Sam on the other hand is an oathbreaking bitch.","And what's even worse is Jon left to go north. A now INDEPENDENT kingdom. So he could have stayed in the north. They don't obey bran. Not only that the unsullied left. And are the only ones who care about Jon everyone else was fine with letting him be. Absolutely crap writing. ""the king should decide."" ""ok choose then"" wut.","Except Sam can't represent House Tarly as he joined the Maesters. His sister or mother should be there.

ELECTIVE MONARCHY FACTION

oh and some shitty claimant one for good measure","I kind of agree with you there: the negativity became a meme in and of itself, and people started reaching for any excuse to keep it going when “Fuck D&D!” started getting stale.

However, what really gets me is the idea that Queen “Smartest Person I Know” failing geography is no stupider than the things that actually made the final cut: going North to capture a wight, “Kinda forgot” about the Iron Fleet, the fact that Daenerys was not able to count to 20 (*twice*), and the constant repetition whenever someone mentioned Doomed To Fail Plot of the Week (Cersei will cooperate, crypts, Jon should be king, bells, “I can’t be Lord of anything”...)","We in no way have the ending, because the bloody books aren't even out yet. And that is an extremely reductionist view to take of discussion among fans, to see it as all about theories on what the ending will be. Like the series isn't just the wikipedia summary of the plot. There is so much more to dicsuss to the books, and it really doesn't require talking about a different work by different creators such as the tv program.

Also, given that we have 5 books out of seven, I would say we already have the middle as well as the start. What we are anticipating is the finale.","Agreed.  r/pureasoiaf hurts themselves with idiotic restrictions, and it hinders discussion.","Have to say I'd definitely disagree with you on that one. Both in that I think /r/asoiaf 
is worse than just discussing the show and books seperately on their own merits, and in that Jon *not* being raised from the dead seems far more likely to me than the reverse.

So technically he could do the same with the last couple entries,"I don't really care about theories. Approaching it as though the book is all about sleuthing out where it's going next; it is a work of fiction and can go anywhere. Anyway even if Martin's word meant anything, in your vox link it isn't even him that being referenced as a source, but the two tv showrunners. *And* it's not even quoting them as having said that it's in the book, it's literally just the article author speculating on what other plot points the show likely will share with future books.

>And indeed, Benioff and Weiss have confirmed that certain twists in recent seasons of the show — like Shireen Baratheon’s death by burning and Hodor’s origin story — came directly from Martin. Jon Snow’s resurrection, his true parentage, and his love affair with Daenerys are likely in this category too, as is the pair’s ultimate fate.

""GRRM has confirmed both things"" Quit being a fuckin' liar, lol","Maybe he'd get more done if he wasn't focused on wrapping things up so quickly.

Edit: It isn't even saying that it comes from the future books.

In addition to the founding members of Houses Florent, Redwyne, Oakheart, etc... each one has likely had countless royal marriages with the Gardener line that they ruled the Reach alongside for several thousand years.

I forgot about the Volmarks, but yeah that’s just a confirmation of my suggestion that the Hoares would have intermarried with their own vassals as well.","He held all the cards- I’m not saying it shouldn’t have gone down that way, just that if I was Argillac I wouldn’t have viewed it as any degree of consolation that my sigil was stolen. I have heard what you are saying. It’s a symbol of Durrandon heritage. All I’m saying is that I would perceive that as a slight regardless, were I a Durrandon. Like I said, insult to injury.

Yes, they are anachronistic, but it is still possible for them to occur. The marriage between a highborn noblewoman and heir whose family has ruled a kingdom for thousands of year, and a foreign bastard, could feasibly be one of these times. Had Orys been willing, it’s an exceptional case if there ever was one. If this were reality and not a fantasy novel where the Orys succeeded because that’s what GRRM wanted (also dragons), conducting the marriage in this fashion would have made his chances of successfully holding the Stormlands much greater","someone can be a cunt, but being a weird stalker of a cunt also makes you a cunt","It's almost as if they liked spreading their seeds in the ""garden"".",You don't know how wet this just made me,That’s.

He was there, as well as many other extras, grey worm's double was there, the direwolves were there, and even the art director was there, he did some QnA afterwards too which was awesome. It was one of the highlights of the trip for us! We did both GoT tours the next 2 days (Iron Islands, and Winterfell), sadly Andrew wasn't our guide, but the people we had were both super enthusiastic extras as well!

(TL;DR I'd personally recommend Sword of Islam, Republic, Old Gods, Way of Life, Horse Lords, Reaper's Due, Monks and Mystics, and Holy Fury. The rest are mostly flavour and random events, but go for it if that interests you.)

> **Expansions**

>    The Sword of Islam: Adds only the ability for the player to have multiple wives as a character of the Valyrian religion.

>    Legacy of Rome: Adds castration and blinding capability as well as a couple of flavour events. It does NOT add retinues.

>    The Republic: Allows the Merchant Republic realms to be played, namely the Free Cities, Meereen, Yunkai, Astapor, Ibben, Asshai and the Guilds of Qarth. These realms will still be active even without the DLC.

>    The Old Gods: Enables the concubine system for Drowned God, Dornish, Pirate, Eastern characters and others (Pre-DLC system will be used if not enabled). Also adds much flavour, including beserkers, adventurers, new rebels and runestones. Raiding is available for drowned god, wildlings, pirates and others even without this DLC.

>    Sons of Abraham: Enables the council of the Most Devout and their election of the High Septon. Also adds many religious flavour events, including various Holy Order events/decisions.

>    Rajas of India: Adds flavour to various far eastern cultures, including tiger hunts, gurus, reincarnation events and other flavour events.

>    Charlemagne: Adds the chronicle, custom kingdoms (existing titular kingdoms are still available without DLC) and a 'hero knight' flavour event

>    Way of life: Enables the focus system, allowing a ruler to pick any of the foci available with all associated events decisions. Seduction focus replaces 'visit chambers' interaction when DLC is enabled

>    Horse Lords: Adds the nomad mechanics for Dothraki/Jogos Nhai (DLC now required to play these), landless adventurer mechanics for Ironborn, the wolf flavour events and land trade routes.

>    Conclave: Adds the enhanced council/favour mechanics, new education focus system, dynamic mercenaries plus other misc flavour

>    The Reaper's Due: Adds improved epimedic and illness mechanics, including hospitals and court physician treatment events. Adds prosperity and depopulation, as well as other flavour events.

>    Monks and Mystics: Adds the devil worshiper societies (needs to be activated via game rules), crown jewell/weapon artefacts and new councillor job actions. Also add the paid quality of life features- allied AI orders and the improved child naming/prisoner interfaces

>    Jade Dragon: Adds unjust conquest casus belli, chinese portraits/buildings which are used in Yi Ti, and some artifact/chinese flavour adapted for the mod.

>    Holy Fury: Adds Shattered/Random World system, Warrior Lodge societies, Tiered-scar system, Kill List, Forge Bloodline ambition, Coronation decision, Sway and Antagonize decisions and other misc flavour. Roman portraits used in Asshai.

> **Other DLC**

>    Ruler Designer: Fully compatible with the mod

>    Customiser: Fully compatible with the mod

>    EU4 Converter: Not compatible

>    Music Packs: The mod's soundtrack currently overrides them, however deleting ""A Game of Thrones/music/songs.txt"" will re-enable vanilla music

>    African Unit Pack/Portraits: Used for the Summer Islanders, Basilisk Islanders and Sothoryos

>    Mongol Portraits: Used for the Nefer and Yi Ti

>    Turkish Portraits/units: Used for Lengi

>    Spanish Portraits/units: Used for Moraqi

>    Celtic Portraits/units: Used for Ibbenese

>    All other Face/Unit Packs: Not used

>    Dynasty Coat of Arms Packs: Not used

>    Sunset Invasion: Some things may happen if enabled...

Starting in the Bleeding Years is fun because there are two other HV houses that you can marry.

You can do ANYTHING as the Targaryens, as long as you have both Fire (dragons) and Blood (HV ethnicity/culture). You lose those, and you lose power.

I established a slaving hegemony in the Crownlands, and to try to ensure that I can remain in power, I totally fucked over the Velaryons (the only other HV house, the Celtigars fucked up) in order to take their house members hostage. I used them as studs and mares, and essentially absorbed them into the Targaryen House.

The key seems to be to try to get as much genetic variation in your family as possible, and have several branches so that you can perform cousin-marriages, rather than sibling ones, which can reduce the effects of inbreeding. It's tricky, because you have to really micromanage the breeding of your house.

It's especially difficult to maintain the Blood when the R'hllor faithful Volantenes stage a revolution in Volantis and kill all of the Essosi Valyrians. Then you're truly alone, and once the Blood is gone, it's gone forever.

Very cool to see how 100 year later, the characters still look very similar to Aegon, Rhaenys, and Visenya.

Actual culture swapping should be dependent as well -- for example, non-inbred characters who are zealous and not proud (like Baelor Breakspear, or Aegon V) would have the option to become Westerosi Valyrian. If a character is inbred (or married to a close relative), and has the High Valyrian gfx culture/is proud, they will become High Valyrian.","You're thinking of Maegor the Cruel.

This comes more into play with bloodlines, where you can play someone with Stark or Lannister, or whatever bloodline, have children with a high valyrian, have those two high valyrian children married, and they'll have a child that looks like a Stark or Lannister(or whatever) despite being genetically high valyrian themselves.

I'm like 15 years in and there has been no one that has tried to challenge the throne, and pretty much no de jure claims among my vassals. Pretty much unprecedented peace. Popped out a bunch of kids and bastards to betrothe em to secure formal non-aggression too. 

Got bored so invaded Pentos and took it over in like a couple months. Granted it to Renly because Stannis already had the Stormlands.","I have a similar game going.

Aerys was murdered by poison and Rhaegar came into the throne, though his reign was shortlived. Robert and Ned faced Rhaegar in a monumental battle in Stokeworth, where Ned fought and defeated Jonothor Darry (captured) and Robert forced Rhaegar to yield in single combat. Jon Arryn, sadly, was killed by Lewyn Martell. Robert went about consolidating his power and had Rhaegar executed. Ned and Hoster Tully managed to convince Robert to spare Rhaella, Elia and the children, sending them to Dorne in exile. 

Lyanna lived, Ned and Howland are the only Northern survivors of the ToJ. Arthur Dayne lived, though defeated by Ned. The three of them swore secrecy to Lyanna and a babe went North with Ned. Lyanna went back to Robert and eventually came to love him.

As repayment for his aid in removing the Targaryens, Robert granted a boon to Tywin Lannister - he released Jaime from his oath and allowed him to return home. The Blackfish was appointed to the Kingsguard, as was Ser Rickard Fell. (I can't remember who else, but there were three total)

Robert tried to appoint Ned as his Hand but was refused - Eddard was newly come into his seat and believed he needed to spend more time in the North so early in his reign. Robert was wroth for a time but relented. He granted Storms End to Stannis and Renly received Dragonstone, though the Lord of Driftmark served as regent until he came of age.

Catelyn gave birth to a lusty red haired boy that Ned named Robb. The babe Ned brought north with him was name Jon and took the bastard name Snow. Lysa Tully, widowed so young, gave birth to a healthy blond boy and remained in the Eyrie. 

Cersei gave birth to a bastard boy, beautiful and golden. She refused to reveal name of the father to Lord Tywin so she was packed off and married to Stannis Baratheon - said to be cold and austere, a prison sentence to one such as Cersei.

Several years passed in peace. Eddard had four more children, two girls and two boys. Robert and Lyanna had six girls, losing one, before she finally birthed a squalling boy with thick black hair. Stannis and Cersei had a pair of black haired twins, a boy and a girl, and two more children with their mother's golden hair. 

That's it so far I think.

I’m just sick of expansion pack based games, like paradox and the sims, who don’t keep some of the expansion features because 1. It feels cheap and 2. That means their future expansions are likely going to retread the ground the old ones did and it doesn’t feel like they’re bothering with innovating","They've apparently been working on this for four years. I really hope it keeps most DLC stuff in. The only things confirmed to not be in are playable republics and nomads - annoying, but bearable for me if it's just that...","Oh right. I didn't expect them to actually butcher the people of the Eurasian steppes away, that would have been too much.","Remember, they weren't in CK2 at first either.

See, all those features that eventually made CK2 a great game aren't going to be part of CK3 at launch. They're going to be carved off and sold back piecemeal, because **fuck you, give me money.**",I am sure some of it will be included in the base game - probably things like artifacts and societies will find their way in. I think it is fair for them to release a base game and then add to it though. The amount of work that goes into each expansion is massive. Especially new start dates etc - the amount of time it takes to create the history for each county's dynasties etc is insane. Adding them all in the base game would mean development takes years and costs a fortune. Which considering they are already one of the only developers creating games in such a niche market...,"Yeah I just read that apparently most of the CK2 DLC stuff is in the game and more. It could be true, especially if they can migrate the dynasty histories etc. I personally never enjoyed nomads or republics so no issue for me aha","I wonder if they could transfer resources? I'm just wondering why CKIII is necessary all of a sudden.

As long as I can play any religion on the map, I think I'll be happy. But if I have to pay to play as non-Christians, I'm just not going to buy it, having a game with objectively more content.

And this is coming out so soon. How much work have they actually put into it? Did they start right after Holy Fury? That seems rushed, idk.

Or did they begin development while still releasing DLC for II? Were they designing features for II while making III, with no plans to implement them in III? That seems wrong.","I mean, I hope this one at least has the whole map, and that every religion will be playable from the get-go. I feel like it’s be kinda cheap to restrict play to just Christian lords again, and I personally would be kinda sad if they did away with India and China and Sub-Saharan Africa. Hell, I even kinda want it to come with Sunset Invasion so that a hypothetical CK3 After the End could have artistically consistent Native American portraits.","Yeah that’s fair, I probably didn’t explain myself every well there. I’ll be disappointed if all the quality of life improvements aren’t there (which I doubt they’ll get rid of). I fully expect them to add to it with a further like spy expansion and a diplomacy etc and I’ll buy and support them, just if they took the spying for example in the base game for 3, and made it practically the same as 2, that’s what I don’t like. If they take like 50% of the improvements over and then expand it even further then that’s what I would appreciate.

I just don’t like it when developers make the base game of the sequel, barely differentiated from the base game of the previous. Which tbf Paradox are good at not doing but EA and the Sims are absolutely awful at it","TS4 was a dagger in the gut when it came out. I bought it, played for an hour, and immediately returned it and went back to TS3.

I picked it up shit cheap with a combo of sailing and sales, and aside from some really interesting game design choices, it's still disappointing.

I honestly don't know what to think or expect. I wonder if they'll realize how everyone feels about things once Dev diaries start coming, but who knows. Imperator had a shit-rocky launch, and i'm still reluctant to buy the game.

They might have my purchase, as long as I can play any religion on the map and it has neater mechanics, maybe a smarter AI, too (lmao, Paradox).

After this you need to take the dragon, which again is basically suicide.

Because she’s got the city which executed her best friend and killed one of her dragons completely at her mercy.

He did, but that was a different thing.

Thoros brought Beric back by administering the last kiss and that putting fire in him.

BwB found Cat, but she'd been in the water days/weeks, and she was too far gone to with any decency bring back, so Thoros refused. Beric effectively transferred his 'fire' to her, he died and she lived.

Now... I'd say you need to be a red priest or be rezzed and have that fire to give to bring someone back. Moreover Thoros didn't even expect it to happen he was shocked and it reforged his faith. If anyone could do it then there would be cases all over Essos and people would be freaking out.

In this case rather than it being canon I think it's an oversight as the script assumes whoever your Court Chaplain is will be a red priest.

Riñar is the word for Children.

Zōklarizes would be an *okay* way to combine them, but that's got two Z's so you might think it a bit much? Zaldrīlas as well.

Hen is ""of"", so I personally like hen Zaldrīlas.

If Dany and Jon have children, one named Rhaegar, their name would be Rhaegar hen Zaldrīlas or Rhaegar hen Zōklarizes, which would roughly translate to:

""Rhaegar, child of the Dragon and the Wolf""

or

""Rhaegar, child of the Wolf and Dragon""

These are rather formal naming conventions, though. You can drop the ""hen"" as well since many names do. 

""Rhaegar--Dragon/Wolf"" - Rhaegar Zaldrīlas

""Rhaegar--Wolf/Dragon"" - Rhaegar Zōklarizes

What they find apparently is mentioning of tournaments where people fight with bastard swords and one+half hand swords and long swords, but what they THINK it might be is the same sword but a different fighting style, basically people competing with different martial arts. Or it could be different swords. But there's nothing really defining about the difference... some places might call a sword a bastard sword here and it has a typical size, some others might call it something different, but there hasn't been anything really significant that explains it, defines the sizes, etc. Could be regional, could be the same sword and more about the fighting style.","Sure it's a Mormont sword, but it's a symbol of Jon as a leader and a reminder of his origins.","It also gets slightly remade to resemble Jon's house, changing the pommel to a wolf",What’s the origin story for Longclaw?

Following advice here to take out Myrcella & Tommen as Aegon VI, I captured Dragonstone and the rest of the realm slowly turned on poor Stannis Baratheon. Having defeated him in two wars and taking two of his titles not to mention our religious, culture and lifestyle differences, and opinions being capped out between -100 and 100, his profound hatred of me could not come close to being realized in game mechanics.  


Nonetheless, Stannis ended up being Aegon's righthand man in wars to reclaim the North for the Starks over the Boltons, a defensive war against the White Walkers and a subsequent War for the Dawn. Despite me hoping we could work things out and let bygones be bygones and me giving him a pretty swank military post, he never really got over things and kept plotting my downfall.   


Plus, dude had not one but TWO fire swords. With Shireen dead and everyone begging me to kill him, and with me set to inherit two limited edition Fire Swords, I eventually relent in realization that we're not ever gonna be bros like I want.  


Selyse has got to go first though, since she'll inherit if she's around, right? So I do what most people would, I start invading her dreams with the Glass Candle my wife Daenerys gifted me, driving her insane and stressing her to death before my plot to kill her can even go through.  


I start doing the same to Stannis, resulting in image you see here. I also start quite successfully carrying out plans to assassinate him. Stannis doesn't care. He keeps getting up. So many people hate him by now that they're lining up back-up plans before Stannis is even dead again, Sansa Stark has pushed him off balconies, Varys has killed him with poisonous snake after poisonous snake, the realm's farms are suffering a massive manure shortage from the amount we've used to blow him up. He keeps coming back.  


I got so cocky that in addition to my psychological torture and successful murders, I married him off to my lover. After Selyse he'd actually managed to marry some hot young thing on his own, but oh man, this poor bastard, can't catch a break and she chokes to death on her food. So I decide hey man, bygones be bygones? Here's a hot young genius wife? And then she was gonna have a baby and save the Baratheons, but then ohhhh shit guess who's baby that.   


Instead, he managed to knock her up somewhere in between manure explosions. I will never get my fire swords. The realization sets in that it is not I who has invaded Stannis Baratheon's nightmares but Stannis Baratheon who has invaded mine.  


I'll let you know if I take him down.","Literally laughed so hard at this it brought tears to my eyes.

Rhaegar will choose Arthur Dayne to champion him and Jaime will die but not before telling the whole seven kingdoms that he fucked his sister just to spite Rhaegar. Tywin legacy will be in shambles when everyone knows but will force Cersei to remain with Rhaegar.

To them, the Freys are basically hillbillies, eager to pass along their mediocre genes to anyone they can get to take them, and even if they both had a major hand in the Red Wedding, the thought process for Tywin was that you could exploit the Frey's resentment, complete lack of interest in cultivating any kind of respectable and classy image, penchant for low cunning, and so on, that they chose them to do it. Tywin would never, ever, be the one to do it, it's incredibly damaging to public image of Lannisters, and it's treacherous. The way people fear the Lannisters is different than they would the Freys, the Freys have no honor, don't fight fair, and you're fearful they'll stab you in the back to steal from you, because they're greedy and ambitious. You don't fear the Lannisters on their own, you only fear invoking their wrath, due to the totality of their punishment, they end lines and make empty castles.  Otherwise, they're respectable, even admirable, so they're absolutely going to disassociate themselves with the Crossing right away, because they're Nouveau Riche, ugly, scrambling, and low brow.

Viserys would likely take Myrcella as a wife in exchange for Casterly Rock's support in betraying the Baratheons, elevating Viserys as king, Viserys would legitimize Joffrey and his siblings and name him Hand of the King and heir to Casterly Rock in place of Tyrion. That way, Joffrey still keeps most of his power. Best possible timeline, King Viserys III and his Hand, Lord Joffrey of Casterly Rock.

If Joffrey gets too cocky and tries to steal Dany from Khal Drogo, he'd just end up sacrificed to the Dothraki horse gods and the Lannister-Targaryen alliance is over.","Yes, Viserys would definitely name Joffrey as heir to Casterly Rock

And He will bestow the richest lordship alongside with prospering economy to Baseborn son of the twin who betrayed Dragon king and Stag usurper, The son of Oathbreaker Jaime and Cersei the Cruel 

There is no reason Tywin will support Viserys either, He intended to kill him when he sacked King's landing and he knew that Viserys will try to get rid of him as soon as he can

And Tywin would smash the envoy if They ever said anything about J+C=J,T,M","That's why it's the best possible timeline. Viserys isn't a rational person, he would side with one of the lesser Usurper's Dogs to screw over House Baratheon, and he would've given Dany to Roose Bolton or Walder Frey if it put him on the Iron Throne.","R5: After doing a re-read of Book 1 of ASOIAF, I latched onto this sentence in chapter 8. Given how disappointing Bran's arc became in the tv, I have a powerful urge to see his dream fulfilled in a playthrough of Crusader Kings.

Taking over Eddard Stark the day before Bran was thrown out of that tower and Winterfell, I made it my mission in life to see Bran a member of the Kingsguard, everything else be damned. The realm could burn and fracture into a thousand pieces, so long as Bran achieved his dream.

Of course, I ended up leading a 60-year period of absolute peace and prosperity as King Robert I died an excommunicated drunk poisoned by(probably) Doran Martell, and was succeeded by his legitimized son Edric I(later known as 'the Stout'), whose only major wars dealt with squashing a few Kings Beyond the Wall, becoming incredibly popular and dying at 50 and being succeeded by his son, Robert II.

This is a screenshot I took of Bran the day he became Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. He had already saved King Robert from two separate assassination attempts(there was no saving him after that). He was in possession of Ice after Eddard, who was sent to the Wall by Robert for trying to take the Riverlands from Edmure's infant son, died. He succeeded Lothar Brune, who had been Lord Commander for 20 \*\*\*\*ing years despite everything cancer, syphilis, lunacy(brought on by said syphilis), stress and losing his hand could do. That man took forever to die, continuing to defy death as every Kingsguard older than Bran died, allowing Bran to rise to his position relatively young.

Bran died a natural death at 77 as he presided over all of King Edric's remaining reign, all of Robert II's and the regency/early adulthood of Edric II.

Other highlights of the incredibly boring playthrough:

Joffrey Baratheon, Lord Commander of the Nightswatch, successor of Eddard Stark, and Benjen Stark before him.

Jorah Mormont married a Pentoshi noblewoman and his child took back Bear Island and converted it to the Lord of Light.

Baratheons ruled over the Stormlands, Iron Isles/Dragonstone(those were merged after Stannis was given the Iron Isles after Balon rebelled again), Riverlands(Edric I married the only daughter of Edmure, and neither of his homosexual sons managed to produce living children before their early deaths) and the Iron Throne.

Robb Stark married Myrcella Baratheon and had 8 children in 12 years, befriended King Edric and was just an all around great vassal before dying of dysentary at 36.

The crippled Lord Paramount Willas Tyrell, husband of Sansa and all-around nice guy, already a cripple, was imprisoned, blinded, castrated and otherwise tortured by a minor vassal of his who rebelled against him. He was rescued via plot by King Edric, but the damage was done. Said minor nobles house may or may not have been slowly exterminated via plots as my realm continued to be totally stable, leaving me bored and vengeful.

That way I could foster him out to Stannis to allow him to gain knighthood.

But once Bran was grown, a knight, and nominated as a Kingsguard, I switched to Robert, who by that time had already exiled Joffrey to the Nights Watch, disinherited Myrcella and married her to Robb, and legitimized Edric after Tommon died of something at 16. 

Robert had a bad time for a while. He pissed off the church for some reason and got excommunicated. I tried my damndest to repair the relationship, but he was assassinated before I could lift the excommunication.

DICK DON’T WORK","Go to the file location of the GoT mod and find the defines.lua file. In my case, this was Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/A Game of Thrones/common/defines.lua

Inside that mode, you have to edit three lines of code. Using Notepad++ is my recommendation. Easy interface, and free. 

Edit the following lines however you like. The names of the variables should be self-explainatory:

AGE_OF_MARRIAGE_MALE = 14

AGE_OF_MARRIAGE_FEMALE = 14

FERTILITY_BASE_MULT = 0.50

I set the marriage age for females at 17 and the males at 20. I figured this would allow a little more a delay for marriages among the nobility, so you are more likely to have cases like Edmure Tully, an unmarried heir in his 30s. And I set the fertility base multiplier to 0.40. It just makes having children a little less likely across the board, which helps the long-term health of the save file.

There's tons of other variables you can edit that affect things like fertility rates among married couples that are in love, how much the AI preferes marriages to certain types of other characters, and the age at which women can no longer get pregnant. That kind of thing.

Firstly, once you explain your reasons for doing so, I don't think anyone would it against you. That was Jaime's problem: not only did he kill the King unnecessarily, but he also neglected to tell anybody *why.*

Secondly, you could easily argue that you were doing it for the King's own safety. The dude wanted to nuke the entire city, which would have gotten him and his grandkids killed - in this case, disobeying the King *is* protecting him, by keeping him and his family alive for a few hours longer.","This is true.

Sitting on the throne to wait was probably a bad idea tho.",">swordyboi

Good band name.","> I think the point was, so many Westerosi lords only care about ""honor"" and ""duty"" that they wouldn't care Jaime was trying to save a bunch of smallfolk.

So this is a bit a problem with the ASOIAF fanbase.

Whenever someone says: ""Lords will do this because they are oathbound to do so"", other people will immediately shout ""Words are wind! Oaths mean nothing! That's the entire point of the series!""

But whenever someone says: ""(House name) is probably going to betray (Claimant name) because everyone is a greedy opportunistic bastard"", somebody will respond with: ""No, (house name) is loyal; they swore an oath to fight for (Claimant name.)""

Fact is, all noble lords of Westeros act differently. Some value ambition above honour, some value the greater good above honour, and some value honour above all else. Some are scum, others are good, and many are in the middle. 

But those who already lean a certain way aren't *entirely* flexible. Even in the ""honour above all else"" crowd there are limits; super honourable Brienne warmed up to Jaime very quickly when she found out why he actually killed the Mad King. Honourable Ned Stark lied to his friends, his King, his wife, and his own family for years in order to fulfill his promise to Lyanna. On Robert's deathbed, Ned also didn't write Robert's words exactly as directed, and withheld the truth about Joffrey's parentage. The honourable thing isn't always the morally right thing, and there are many characters who understand this.

If Jaime had restrained Aerys instead of murdering him, and then revealed the presence of the wildfire beneath the city, I think the lords who shout ""Oathbreaker!"" would be a very vocal minority. Many of the lords and knights who were in King's Landing at the time would likely see Jaime as a hero, even.",Kingslayer and the Swordybois.,My new username in MORDHAU,"Yeah, those are excellent points.

I then used a combination of yesman and event pil.# to get the plot done in a few days. Jaime and Cersei were arrested and Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen were disowned.

I then went into the save and connected Gendry to Robert's dynasty (as a bastard of course), since I figured that if Ned did succeed in his plot to expose the scandal, he probably would've told Robert about the bastard that helped him connect the dots (IMO, if the Joffrey plot succeeds that should happen by default given that Gendry plays a pretty key role)

You need five points to survive.  Give death a place to stay for one point, pick black for a second and as you have genius that should give you another 2 points.  Now all you have to do is get one point in the remaining rounds.  If you take a risk and cheat you have a 2/3 chance to get 5 points or a 1/3 chance to die.  If you get lucky with a good result by concentrating then you have 5.   If you still only have four your best shot is a sacrifice with will give you about a 50% chance of surviving if you have four points.",I have over 3000 hours clocked in and I have yet to ever beat this event,My favorite event!

The vanilla one has death instead of stranger(or other gods depending on religion) and cyvasse is chess","Check my latest post.

If I remember correctly.","R5: Queen Daenerys I continues to rule with an Iron Fist, with a kill count of over 150+. Her vassals quake at the sound of dragon wings, and House Targaryen has unquestionable rule throughout the continent. 

Rickon Stark and his northern rebellion has been crushed, and the North has been granted to Alys Karstark. Daenerys' last opponent, Harrold Arryn, languishes at the wall, and now her vassals rarely join factions lest they get obliterated like Houses Farring, Throne, or Bar Emmon, all of which were burnt alive/fed to a dragon with the execption of the youngest child. 

Daenerys has killed four high septons through trials, murder, and exile, and gave the faith their power to arm themselves, before retracting vassalage of the Warrior's Sons and Poor Fellows. A dragon bows to no one, and the holy warriors of Westeros will follow the crown now instead. 

At this point, there is no more real resistance to the Mad Queen's rule. Any of her vassals with a negative opinion of her tend to find themselves in prison or called to trial, and her other vassals have good opinions of her; she might have -70 tyranny and be cruel/lunatic/fire obssessed/etc. but she is also a dragon rider and has lvl. 5 fear at this point. The Great Houses are loyal now since the Queen commands Bannermen to end any wars for claims or revolts, and many such as the Karstarks, Baratheons(2.0) and Reynes are grateful to the Queen for their new titles, having been raised up in place of houses that had previously rebelled and been crushed by dragonfire.","Jon Snow: ""YoUr NeW EmPiRe?""","Holy smokes, what portrait mod is this?",Damn dude can you upload your save.

I am legitimately curious.",Long live the queen,"So it seems in the end, they did underestimate your power.",THE WHORE IS PREGNANT!,Could you post the submods you used to get this playthrough?

The next one will be a mini AAR in about 10 years from this screenshot, since Dragon Queen Dany is going to so crazy stuff once Westeros is finally secured.","I’ve found the best way to do it is stack fertility and routinely banish people from your court, since having too many people in your court also lowers fertility. Dany got +20% from when she fell in love, I took the family focus and the groom heir ambition has been on for awhile, so she’s been having a kid every couple years. I hope she has a few more though, since I need cadet dynasties and some spare dragon riders","No problemo! All of the children have the same parents (Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, who has had his parentage revealed + legalized). Despite how much of a freaking lunatic Daenerys has become, the marriage is a happy one.

As of 321 AC, the Royal children consist of:

* Aegon Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone. He is 20 years old and has a younger twin brother, Aemon. Aegon is ambitious, scholarly, brave, and honest, but despite their differences he is 100% loyal to his mother's rule. He is a liberator like her and a brilliant strategist, having smashed the forces of House Stark in the storming of Moat Cailin when he was only 16. He tamed the Queen's third original dragon, Viserion, and is ambitious; if Queen Daenerys were to die, Aegon Targaryen would eagerly continue his mother's work.

* Aemon Targaryen, Prince of Summerhall is his younger twin. A Brilliant Steward, he is the realm's master of coin. He was married to the daughter of Bellegre Otherys, who is one of the few people with the Blood of the Dragon, being descended from Aegon IV and his lover, the original Black Pearl of Braavos. Aemon is quiet, troubled by Dragon Dreams at night that constantly make him aware of threats to his family. He is kind and just and spends his days gardening; though he has a positive opinion of his mother, he disagrees with her methods and cruelty. He and his wife have a five year old daughter named Daenerys, after the Queen. He rides the nimble dragon Artaxes, though it is still a small creature.

* Daeron Targaryen is 19, and currently unmarried. He is a skilled leader of men and is the model of knighthood; honorable, chaste, diligent, etc. He has not done very much so far, but it's liekly he will be named to the Queensguard if a position becomes available soon.

* Maekar Targaryen is the Queen's fourth son, 18, and much more agreeable with her style of rule. He is a ruthless man who wholeheartedly believes in his mother's plan to liberate those in chains, and will ruthlessly pursue that if given the chance. When Harrold Arryn was imprisoned and sent to take the Black, his widow Sansa was (forcibly) married to Maekar. While not a happy or pleasent marriage, if they do have any children then they would be potential lords of winterfell if House Karstark resorted to treason at a later point.

* Aenar Targayren is the Queen's fifth son, 16, and the first to inherit the Stark look. Fashionable, Just, Honest; Aenar is a pretty nice guy all things considered. Right now he is unwed, but his love affair with Carriah Arryn (Harrold Arryn's daughter, kept at court as a ward/hostage) is an open secret. A marriage between the two is a possibility in the future, to mend the rift between House Arryn and House Targaryen.

* Rhaella Targaryen is the Queen's sixth child, aged 15 and named after the Queen's mother. She was Daenerys' first daughter (despite having the ambition for years) and was married to her brother Aegon at 14. She is honorable, quick, fair, and content, an ideal wife for a Targaryen prince; though she is fire-obsessed like her mother. Five months ago she gave birth to a sickly son named Aurion, but so far the child has not died; if he can survive his crib, then Aurion Targaryen could potentially sit the Iron Throne after his father. She also has a young she-dragon as her mount, named Elaenal.

* Jaehaerys Targaryen is only 13. A squire who is quick and fair, he shows more promise than his brothers did at his age. He is betrothed to his younger sister Rhaenyra, and when he turns sixteen the Queen intends to grant him the name 'Redwyrm', to take lordship over some of the Valyrian colonies and establish a healthy, *loyal* Targaryen cadet dynasty.

* Rhaenyra Targaryen is 8, named for the only other woman to ever sit the Iron Throne. She is a shy girl with a stutter, and has her father's looks instead of her mother's

* Rhaegar Targaryen is 5. An angry boy, it's hard to tell whether Rhaegar is destined for madness or greatness.

* Visenya Targaryen is 3. She has the classical valyrian look and will surely be a fair woman in the future, though no one is certain whether she will marry one of her brothers, sold off to some other house, or perhaps become a warrior herself, like her namesake.

* Aenyx Targaryen is only 1, but unlike his nephew he is in perfect health.

* Daenaera Targaryen is the youngest child, being only a week old. She might potentially be betrothed to Aurion in the future, or married to Aenyx if he too is ordered to create another cadet dynasty.

Daenerys isn't totally loved by her not-nearly-as-crazy children, but overall their family is only a bit dysfunctional. The real test will be how her grandchildren turn out, since Aurion was born a lunatic and two of her sons are both ambitious and not heirs, a bad combination.","Trained Warrior, There's a submod from the old forum (idk if it is still there, if you want to look for it it's called Attris_gs) that changes what the personal combat skill traits look like. It's pretty minor, but it never conflicts with anything so I just leave it on.","This is in the base mod, I took the forge bloodline ambition and this was one of the options the event gave me, and I thought it fit mad tyrant Daenerys perfectly.","It's actually a vanilla event.

Fun fact: if you get this bloodline, years after your ruler's death, so many legends will have spread about your character that the commonfolk will believe they were *actually* a dragon - and it's represented by their portrait and culture changing to that of a dragon post-mortem.","Basically the more things you do in which people will fear you, like execute criminals or the more powerful you are, the less likely they will start plots and join violent factions like install claimant, independence, etc.",If he's using the more bloodlines submod there are bastard Reynes,Fear farming is one of the most satisfying things you can do in this mod,I always use this and it returns weird graphical errors where everyone's chin recedes.,Do you need all the portrait DLC for it to work?,Do you mind posting the submods you used?,One of my favorite things to do way back was conquer Essos and set up Cadet dynasties of House Targaryen. So much fun.,How do you make a cadet dynasty without them being a bastard?,Thanks!,What does this specific bloodline include?,"Lmao, really? Thats rad",Holy shit that's fucking awesome.,Yes! My first emperor got this! A few decades later as his grandson the portrait changed to a dragon! It’s awesome!,Nice i should try it,"And the Freys are an ample, easily renewed resource.","Apparently is a Mac issue, at least the ones involving the Dornish and Qarth in my case.","I don't think they are actually forming them a new cadet dynasty, but just giving them landed titles, which sends them off to their court to be AI controlled and not under the players control anymore, to be another branch of the Targaryen house (like how Kevan Lannister is another branch of the Lannister house)",Editing save files,"It made her a cannibal when I got it, but the bloodline itself is a matrillineal one that that gives +10% arrest chance and -4 vassal opinion. I mainly chose it for the Nickname, though the arrest chance is actually pretty useful.","If you have a dragon it isn't a terrible plan, right now I have almost no vassals in factions since Daenerys has been burning people and crushing revolts for about 15 years now. Fear also lowers province revolt risk too, so religious and peasant revolts are almost non-existent at this point even as a keep extorting money from them for my colonization schemes.",Yeah the devs added it because there was no reason to be a Ramsay Bolton ruler. This way you can be a dick and be fine.,Im on PC! It's frustrating because that head pack looks amazing.,"Cool stuff, thanks for the response!","I got the Child of the Others event chain for Aegon's daughter once (named Daenarys of course). Stacking fear with an utterly unbeatable dragonrider (Balerion) was a lot of fun. -100 opinion with almost everyone, yet very few uprisings. Got the nickname ""the Mercyless"" less than a year into her rule. Finally got killed off by event (zealots cornered her in her bedroom as she was a known satanist) at 67.",I feel you!!!,"Version 1.6 Changelog (See comments for the rest)

Exactly the update I needed to continue playing again.","Thank you for everything you and the team do with this mod! 

I just downloaded it and on the main menu it still says Version 1.5, but once I start a game I do not get any errors, and the portraits look all new, so I am guessing it is the newest version.

Rank 2 = Investors, can invest into the bank with money that grows over time etc.

Rank 3 = Keyholder, can be sent to negotiate the terms of loans instead of it just being a flat amount based on tier. Some powers related to being higher up in the bank etc.

Rank 4 = High Councillor, can use bank funds under the table to fund their own activities, can plan invasions and assign hits on debters which lower ranks carry out

* Press CTRL + F to open a little box, go to 'Replace' tab.
* Type 'english' in the first bar, \[Find what\] and 'german' in the second \[Replace with\] without quotations.
* Hit 'Replace All' and you're done.

Not only was she deflowered but she was also possibly carrying his child. Robb did not want to ruin a woman's life and he also didn't want any bastards.

Most Cailin is better represented since it didn't had a permanent garrison and having to leave a small army there it's exactly what Robb did in the books, but being able to easily invade the Vale it's something that will never be solved in CK2 due to the game limitations",But they take the neck and you don't get ticking warscore bonus,Saying that the Ai is incompetent at defense is very different from saying the North or the Vale are hard to defend. I get the point being made about limiting game mechanics but acting like it negates all defensive advantage like the OP comment was implying is ridiculous,They cant pass the moat though if you can hold it and theyre going through the neck.

Married myrcella to Robert arryn giving me a third ally.

Then all hell broke loose.  Sansa promptly got knocked up, then had an Irish twin.  Robert drank himself to death.  once joffrey took over, dorne rebelled, and it's been non-stop war for at least a decade.  Probably doesn't help I've been playing joffrey as an utter bastard.

Tommen married daenerys.  Margaery tried to tame a dragon and got fried. Tyrells got pissed and rebelled and put down. Dragons are rampaging across the continent because daenerys got executed for trying to take the throne.  Every rebellion put down adds to my lands as joffrey would execute them and take their land.  As of now, the Vale and north are the only ones not owned directly by the crown.  The iron islands are independent as they seized the opportunity to strike when aegon decided to invade.  They won't be independent for long.  So far I've been pretty lucky, there's never been more than one kingdom in rebellion at a time as they have been fighting among each other as well.

Joffrey is inevitably going to be assassinated, and a true baratheon will once again sit on the throne.  The plan is, once Roberts son is on the throne, is to restore peace as his traits would make him a fairly benevolent ruler.  Distribution of titles and lands to those who remained loyal.  Perhaps once his son is on the throne, I can set my sights towards essos.  I've been working on slowly building shipyards in all of my territories on the summer sea side.

It was pretty exciting unti the pay to win and free to play gap got crazy. I invested a lot of time and like $15 dollars and was around 7 mil in power. Some of these dudes were in the hundreds of millions at this point.

If you lose the stormlands to Aegon, I thought you got game over?","This is why, IMO, Stannis should not have the Stormlands as his main title. He should have a titular emperor title instead, maybe something like “Kingdom of Westeros” (as it’s noted in the books that Stannis is the first king to style himself “King of Westeros”). This would make the AI value taking back the stormlands less, which book Stannis pretty much purposely abandoned when he went north. Additionally, this would allow him to vassalize the north if he successfully defeats the Boltons, which would give him much more land which would help how easy it is for the Lannister’s to win just by sieging the few counties Stannis has as paramount of the stormlands. That may seem OP but It’s pretty hard for Stannis to actually beat the Bolton’s so it wouldnt happen that often.",Dragonstone is I believe de jure Kings land. So it does not go to aegon.,I thought Aegon the Conqueror called himself King of Westeros between his landing in Westeros and his actual coronation by the High Septon.,"No kidding, stannis in AFFC start has been unplayable for me because by the time I’ve beat the Bolton’s I’m imprisoned after getting -100% warscore against Tommen/Aegon :(","I didn’t actually know that until you pointed it out, but still it’s taken as something of note that Stannis doesn’t refer to himself as “king off the andals, etc, lord of the seven kingdoms” 

Aegon called himself King of *All* Westeros and Shield of the People, which as you said was dropped when He was crowned and limited his ambitions to the Seven Kingdoms.

That’s somewhat in contrast to Stannis interestingly enough, who claimed the titles of his brother until he defeated Mance Rayder and expanded his ambition to ruling the lands beyond the wall, thus simply “King of Westeros”.

I think it’s precedent enough for a temporary titular title, especially since IMO it drastically would help gameplay. My main focus is on the title rank, call it “the empire of stannis’ host” for all I care","It's ASOIAF universe, he's lucky he didn't get 'Cocksucker' as a nickname instead.

Appreciate the entertainment.","R5: Playing as Aerys II starting in the Ninepenny Kings bookmark, Rhaegar grew up to be pure badass under Gerold the White Bull and came of age just as Edmyn Tully rebels with like half of Westeros at his back. 278AC and Tywin brings about 5k men to support my 2k at a battle in King's Landing. The rebels sent wave after wave of men, adding up to 58k as you can see. They were fighting about 30k at any one time. The Battle of the White Sword Tower lasted almost a full moon's turn until the Dragon Prince, The Stern Lion and the Bold Whitecloak beat back the onslaught of rebels.

PS. I like to use console commands to give characters certain nicknames so Tywin has the nickname ""the Stern"" and Edmyn Tully is ""the Wildfish"", and yeah the title should really say 8x their size I was looking at the 45k number like an idiot haha",This is why you put commanders on your big fuck off army,So basically 45000 men retreated and ran away from 1800.,"I've only ever really see the larger army win, and on the few times the smaller army has won the different between the size of the two armies was almost negligible.

Does martial score actually make a substantial impact or what?",While losing over 2/3 of their force,"""A victory even Robert would be proud of""",With Stannis I’ve beaten armies 4x my size but this is impressive.,I know this is a noob question but how do you get that battle info screen?,What is the console command to add nicknames? I know the commands for like everything else but that.,"I think the reason why you won the battle is morale. When the rebels sent their first army stack into KL it was too weak to stand up to your nearly 8k troops and started to rout; their morale got too low. Routing armies receive all the damage at the end of a battle as they are, well, routing, and thus not fighting. If more armies join that battle, and if their morale is not high enough to break the routing phase back to a battle phase, then they also will begin to route and take damage/casualties. This can yeild results like this where ""50k"" troops can lose to a lot less.",The AI will never learn,"There are a fair amount of stories from history where the numerically superior side ends up retreating for some reason despite being in a position to win.  For instance, they might mistakenly believe that a large army is approaching to reinforce the enemy.

As an example, I recently watched a video on the siege of Malta (1565), and the Ottoman forces were close to capturing the island's main fortress.  Then small cavalry force attacked the Ottoman camp from behind.  The cavalry force wasn't strong enough to cause serious harm to the Ottomans, but their army panicked believing that a much larger relief force had arrived.  The Ottoman army retreated from their attack, losing all of the gains they had made during the hard fighting.  This delay in taking the fortress allowed time for an actual large relief force to arrive at the island, at which time the Ottomans fully withdrew.","But if the battle had been going on for a month and they’ve had roughly the same numerical advantage the whole time and not only does nothing seem to give but they actually seem to be *losing*. 

One thing to consider also is that enemy troops don’t know what the other sides morale is at, for all they know they could still be at 100 morale and ready for more.","I honestly have no clue how this happened, I'm as amazed as you are which is why I posted it. Maybe it has something to do with being on defensible terrain? The White Sword Tower has decent defence after all. It's probably a mix of everything that allowed this.

This game is gearing up to be one of the most story-worthy I've had in a long time, Jaehaerys II ""the Arbiter"" died during a pirate raid on his ship on his way back from a tour of Lomas Longstrider's wonders.

EDIT: I believe they suffered a river crossing penalty since the battle took place on the Red Keep county so coming from King's Landing proper, they would have had to cross the Blackwater.","Leader martial score and traits, troop composition and terrain all have an effect. Even leader culture can have some benefit. You can apparently do a lot with matching the right culture and troop types (Scottish or Italians with pikes being a common example in the base game). Whatever the case, 7k vs 57k and winning is a very good result.

I never really pay attention to traits other than the ones that actually say they have an effect in the tool tip, and ignore culture. Don't finagle with troop composition either, that's not a part of the game I like to micromanage.","This, i would like to know what stats count as a force multiplier.","Select your army while it is in battle and you will get the battle screen, afterwards the result will pop up as shown above. If it doesn't for you, have you messed with message settings?","You can enable them in your message settings in the esc menu (combat section iirc), but they should be enabled by default.","nickname [nickname code] [CharId]

So for ""the_Great"" it would be nickname nick_the_great [CharId]

You can find a list for nickname codes for vanilla nicknames on the wiki and for modded ones go into the mod's common folder, then nicknames then open one of the text files.","Yep its the river crossing penalty that does it. There is no terrain bonus for KL otherwise. If any of the commanders had any good leader traits (HI leader, cavalry, defender, plains commander) then it gives a huge boost. Also it looks like the opposing army has no leader, leading to a huge debuff for them.","Did you give chase or hold your ground? I'm not sure about the agot mod (since there is no tech) but I know in vanilla if your outnumbered but tech and leadership superior army wins the first battle, it is very possible to successfully hunt down the retreating larger army and further dwindle their numbers. Especially if one of your commanders blessed with a movement trait like Organizer.","combat makes no sense, just throw a high martial person in to lead, have favorable terrain and just pray. 

or get a dragon and then it’s gg.","Ahh, that makes sense, thanks for shedding light on this!","Flanking, experimental, and leading the center all give nice bonuses","The more important part: when you manage to break enemy's morale and enter pursuit to kill as much as you can, only a really big ammount of reinforcements can turn that battle into your loss. And since you said that they kept reinforcing the battle (probably in small numbers), the new guys were routing just after entering battle due to ultra low morale. Also river crossings/terrain/traits/high martial play a lot into how much damage to the enemy you deal.","R5: Robert's Rebellion start, won the throne for Rhaegar, won the war after Aerys got assassinated by a minor lord (Not my fault, I swear). Married Lyanna (Both she and ""Aemon"" lived, I've gotten lucky this playthrough), Forgave most of the lords, including my new BIL, and threw Robert into the Night's Watch.

&#x200B;

Not two years later, I find out why the default for the Jade dragon Casus Belli is Off, as Ned starts a vassalization war for the Night's Watch. He goes into battle, engages in a duel against the enemy commander...Robert. Of course, I noticed none of this, being busy with smoothing out a very long list of newly-formed grudges against me, until I get this pop-up.

I know exactly the events that unfolded for this to happen, and yet I'm still bewildered.",GODS HE WAS STRONG THEN!,"This reminds me when I was playing as Ned and somehow everyone knew about Jon (I don't remember if use the console or if the event triggered idk) and Robert kept asking for Jon and I refused so he declared war on me. I had an alliance with Mace because Margaery was married to Robb so I had the Riverlands and The Reach with me against Robert, Tywin and the Vale, one of the best wars I've had in the mod. In the end Robert killed like 3 or 4 lords from the north and almost killed me, but in the end I won.","""OK""",How’d you find that crown,The question does Aegon still not Wun it,Just picturing Robert bristle with anger and shout “Why did you kneel?” before striking at Ned. Probably feels like the whole world betrayed him. Pretty amazing story possibilities here.,"Robert isn't really the bad guy here, Ned is for trying to take control of the Nights Watch",So I can vassalize the NW with JD's CB's on?,"""One Thorn in my side took out another? Alright!""","After I won the throne I got an opportunity to make a new one, I chose the option with seven gemstones.

I do have submods so if that particular crown is in one, I'll get back to you.

EDIT: It's Jaehaerys' Crown. I got the opportunity to make it again because it was after Rhaenyra had sold it.","Aegon seems to enjoy the prospect of the crown.

*Aemon* seems to not Wun it, which works out!","Robert then cut Ned down, severing 3 of his limbs. With tears in his eyes Robert screamed ""You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy Rhaegar, not join him! Bring balance to the realm, not leave it in darkness!""",My headcanon for that is that corruption and desertion in the NW are on a huge rise and Robert's trying to take advantage of it to rebel again and that's why Ned's trying to stop him.,Yeah that's one of the most un-Ned actions I can think of.,"As Rhaegar, I don't have the option, Yet Eddard, LP of the North, managed to do it.",lol whenever I play Rhaegar I do my best to get Aegon killed. Kinda anticlimactic having the song of ice and fire just sit around as a courtier.,"Makes sense the Wall is high, so he had the high ground.","A better reality of this would be Robert deserting with Mance and then once Mance invades the wall, Ned sends a reinforcement force that he leads as he wants to confront Robert.A massive battle ensues at the fist of the first men were Ned and Robert meet on the Battlefield, Robert cuts Ned down and along with high casualties and low morale, the Northmen retreat in defeat.Ned's death brings Rhaegar's attention to the Wall and he mobilizes a force to defeat Mance. Eventually a treaty is signed between Mance and Rhaegar(as Rhaegar knows that the others are coming), one of the conditions of the treaty is that Robert is to be arrested and executed, Robert now betrayed by the Wildlings flees up North were he about to die of exposure until several blue icy men surround his body and touch his forehead:Robert becomes the Night King.",Grey King doesn't have dragonslayer trait wooooowwww,"That's actually how I learned about the Night Queen and her King... lol

In all seriousness season 8 was a dumpster fire due to the writers deciding to disregard many established character arcs and profiles in order to make an ending that disregards the spirit and development of the show.

For example, the first main point is Dany’s descent into madness. It is criminal to claim that she has been showing maniacal tendencies when she has done nothing of the sort. Her order to kill everyone that follows Cersei runs counter to many previous orders she gave regarding defeated enemies. While the sack of Astapor remains a stark outlier, she showed mercy when treating with the masters of Yunkai and Mereen. And to further show this point, Dany has shown mercy 2 times to the Yunkai masters, only executing them when they reneged on their deals twice.

Additionally, Dany showed much mercy and locked up her own children when a child was burned and eaten by Drogon. It makes no sense for her to purposely cause that much destruction to many such children given she was shocked at the horrific burning of a little child. It is improbable to think that Dany would willingly descend into such madness, even if you factor in the Targaryen coin flip.

If you have any other reasons or such as to why season 8 was good, feel free to reply to this comment or pm them to me so I can discuss them and lay out my reasons.

And also, as a note, there were several good moments in season 8 by my own admission. However, those moments were minor and usually lasted only 1-2 scenes compared to the holes in the main storyline.","Ha, I get this reference","Indeed they are,  but thats where the joy lies.

I'd argue that Jon, Dany, and Arya all had more interesting stories, maybe not quite as weird and wacky, but definitely more interesting, IMO.

Sure, it may be better than the ending of Season 8... but seriously, Season 8 isn't exactly a high bar to aim for...

I may be a little biased on this one, but I personally think that, at least for the show, an ending with Gendry and Arya ruling Westeros would've made the most sense when weighing up the merits of creating an ending that feels subversive and bittersweet (aka, fan-favourite Dany still dies) but still logical and meaningful, as well as being laced with an intense feeling of irony. It was also create an ending that makes sense given the internal laws and logic of Westeros and the motivations of the story's characters.

Subverting expectations doesn't have to be a bad thing. The show's popularity and notoriety was built on the likes of episodes such as Baelor, The Rains of Castamere, and The Mountain and the Viper. It was entirely possible to do the Dany's downfall right if the writers actually cared.","Yeah, it’s boring and predictable and too much in the spirit of a happy ending.

Figured if they let Sam join the court after s8 I might as well set Aemon free too,"They didn't do anything involving Gendry's heritage. He was just shrugged off to a duchy. No plot, no surprise, no nothing really,","GOT needed some sort of tragedy at the end but some redeeming factor but Instead the end itself was the tragedy

Dang and Jon being king and queen with a fairy tale ending is better than that","I dont disagree to be fair.  I just personally think the shoehorning in of King Bran could not be more brazenly a last minute switch.  No one expected it because it made no sense.    


Jon and Dany, or just Jon becoming king might seem a little cliche to us now knowing what we know.  But **I think** it was always Martin's intention.  The analyzers and theoryists might have worked out R+L=J pretty early on, but I think he was happy with his writing not giving that away to the average readers too early on.    


I think we could all think of an ending we would prefer, all I know is I would rather the one that was a bit cliche and obvious, but at least logical and wholesome and conclusive than the random story we got.",Definitely not,I guess that Daenerys earning her throne and having a baby with Jon is good storytelling and having literally everything go her way is good storytelling? Instead of actually showing her Targaryen madness at full force?,"That’s not bittersweet. You know what’s bittersweet? A hero going crazy, a man being forced to kill is love and be exiled, a soldier seeing the person he cared for the most lose her head in front of him, a man who loved his sister no matter the conflicts they had with one another dying with her after being crushed, an abused and tormented woman finally proving herself to be a person deserving of respect, a girl finally letting go of her anger to go see the unknown world, a hard warrior killing the brother who abused him and overcoming his fear of fire, a former slaver who lived in a shameful exile finally redeeming himself by dying defending the woman he loved even though she didn’t love him, and a continent finally being returned to a state of peace due to the destruction of the very thing that caused all the chaos and death and war to begin with.

That makes for a bittersweet ending. Having Sandor, a SINGLE loved character, dying isn’t bittersweet at all. Having everyone alive and well with Jon going against his own beliefs to marry Daenerys and nobody the fans like dying isn’t bittersweet. It’s tropey and obvious fanservice.",event bastard.999 1002059,"Your bringing logic into S8

And also thought about it more than the writers",That's also a good point.,"Yeah, but the difference is George's writing versus D&D's.","The journey is more important than the destination

D&D's was so hamfisted its outrageous If Bran's king there better be a damn good reason why and good explaintion as to how

Rather than who has a better story than the guy who chilled with tree man for most of the story","That is basically what I said in my comment.

Again, my ideal ending is just my opinion and one of several different widely accepted ""better alternative endings"", and is also mainly in reference to fixing the stupidity of Bran becoming King rather than fixing the stupidity of how Dany's downfall was portrayed (which I also agree is a major problem with the ending).

I'm not from the camp of people who think that Dany and/or Jon needed to sit on the Iron Throne by the end of the story and think GRRM is somehow betraying them by ending their characters and their House similarly in the books. Like I said, I think the ending needed some sort of tragedy in order to feel genuine and sincere and in line with the story's narrative, and Dany's downfall and eventual death at the hands of her lover is the sort of stuff that Game of Thrones is known for. It could've been great if only her final character arc had been written and executed properly.","While I do think that GRRM always intended to do R+L=J (After all, D&D got their jobs for guessing the fan theory), I don't think that necessarily means that GRRM always intended for Jon to be King. GRRM did set out to write ASOIAF with the express intent of ""subverting the tropes of fantasy"" and for Jon to turn out to be a secret heir to the Throne and for that information to **not** lead to where everyone expects (Jon becomes King), rather it creates tension between Jon and Dany that ultimately boils over into Dany going mad fits this core theme of ASOIAF far better. Of course it needs to be far more developed, fleshed out, and you know... logical than the rushed mess of a character dive that we got in Season 8, and I honestly believe that GRRM will be able to do that in the books (I also think there will be other contributing factors leading to Daenerys' downfall in the books, such as fAegon).

And I do agree that after Season 8 we can all create an ending that we would prefer. The reason I gave my two cents was that I do believe the final season could've created a logical and satisfying plot twist as to who will sit on the Iron Throne, when we've all been expecting it to be Jon and/or Dany for years. I think that the fact that Season 8 is so terrible has let a lot of people to believe that any ending in which Dany doesn't go mad would've been a good ending, and I'm definitely not a fan of an ending in line with OP's CK2 game, but at the same time, I really, really can't blame you or anyone else for preferring this kind of ending over the train-wreck that was Season 8.","It's better than how the ending we got was presented at least, in my eyes. The rush to the finish ruined it IMO","Lol what an absurd strawman. I'm all about downer endings where shit goes wrong, but the execution is as important as the idea itself. I think the books are going to end in a similar way to the show, actually, and I think its gonna be awesome because the char developments will be sufficiently fleshed out, and Dany's spiral into villany is gonna be more than a lazy asspull in the second to last episode. Half-hearted ""foreshadowing"" is not character development.","Jaime would still be dead, Daenerys destroys the tower not knowing Jaime had already killed Cersei. His character was assassinated most egregiously. Jorah, Missandei, Lyanna, Theon would still all be dead. The ending would diverge when Daenerys rides to the tower.",Thanks.,"Yeah a lot I agree with here.  I personally found Dany's breaking point one of the saving graces of the season. That being said there was not enough prodding of her patience to warrant the mass murder, it ended up being like a woah, very premature.  And while there is the whole Madness Greatness coin flip with the targs, that just seemed still so far from the grain of her character.    


I like the idea of it not going as expected, Jon and or Dany not getting the throne, but Bran... I just cant really fathom that ending.  I can't see how George ever could have planned it, if anything, he was one of a very very short list of absolutely nots for me.","No, it’s not. It’s generic as hell.","Yeah, “half hearted” foreshadowing that’s already been done in the books. It sounds like you have more of a problem with George than D&D.

She’s had character development. And that development led to her becoming a tyrant.","Dany has been burning people since S2. Her character arc has always aimed at S8E5, people just didn’t want to believe it.",So there’s just no pay off to all the hints of Dany being a nut tyrant?,"Arya should have faced into Jaime and stabbed Cersei, as she walks away and real Jaime walks in watching her die. Would have been epic","That’s still not bittersweet, plus it would leave a huge plot hole with why Daenerys didn’t just go and burn the Red Keep she first went to Westeros.

The generic ending you want wasn’t ever going to happen in the show or the books. Daenerys and Jon were never going to rule together. And Westeros was never going to be united again. An ending like that was the very thing George wanted to avoid, as his whole goal was to not use a ton of tropes.

And stop with the Jaime killing Cersei thing. Why would Jaime kill Cersei and her baby when it’s obvious he loves her too much to do that?","No problem, hope it works","Unlike the entire last season's writing?

There's a reason it's almost universally hated by fans of the books and casuals.","Lol, S8 is universally hated for being rushed, predictable and nonsensical. I would take a generic ending than the shitstorm we got instead.",Dense,"Wrong. I did, from I first read CoK years back, come to expect that Daenerys was going to end up going all fire and blood on Westeros. The books are, I would say, very clearly leading up to this. She is slowly developing very messed up tyrannical traits. Really, thats what her whole arc is about; her having to make a choice between the ""good queen"" she wants to be, and the ""easy road"" of just burning shit to the ground, all the while every ""good"" choice she tries to make only leads to more misery. Conquering is easier than ruling fairly.

But rewatch the show, and tell me with a straight face that her turn turn to completely mindless mustache-twirling cartoon villainy is properly developed. I dare you. The show changed a whole lot from the books in its portrayal of her, from early on in the story. Yes, she kills people. Jon kills people. Brienne kills people. Arya straight up mass-murders *all the Freys.* Does that mean Arya was developing into a crazy, murderous lunatic who is going to massacre thousands of people for *literally no practical reason* other than nonsensical, vaguely defined ""madness""? Nah, you go girl, Arya is so badass!

Daenerys' whole story (up until they outpaced the source material) is *very clearly* framed in a heroic light by the series itself. She doesn't develop organically the way she does in the books, and it most definitely does not justify the lazy asspull of writing that is the series finale.","I’m a fan of the book and like the show. Just because you surround yourself with people that share he same opinion as you, doesn’t mean most people have he same opinion as you.

Explain how season 8 was generic and predictable.","Just because you surround yourself with fans who share the same opinion as you, doesn’t mean most fans share the same opinion as you.

Then it looks like you’re more interested in fairy tales than an actual story.","Oh man, where to even begin. [These](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yc0dwLYUUkE) [videos](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=I8U6kjqLkJQ&t=3s) usually sum it up for me.


But to recap of course, poor military decisions during the Battle of Winterfell, not utilizing resources gained from Daenerys' freed slave cities to maintain her army and the North, cutting important scenes from the viewer like Jon explaining his heritage to his siblings, Arya returning to Winterfell and leaving it immediately barely acknowledging her family on the way out even though they're the reason she came back anyway, Bran crowned as king and having the best story ever despite doing jackshit these past 3 seasons, Euron Greyjoy somehow managing to ambush Daenerys despite her better vantage point in the sky with a very visible view of the sea and land, a terribly comedic skit meeting with the ""great lords"" of Westeros in the Dragon Pit deciding the future of the realm with the resounding vote being an ""Aye"", which is a Northern phrase so I'm wondering why most of the Southern lords did that instead of signing some sort of treaty, choosing the a Northerner as king of the realm while also agreeing the their king's sister is now the Queen of an independent North separate from the rest of them with barely a complaint...

I could go on if you want.","Are you seriously arguing against the fact that the majority of people hated season 8 and it's writing? The ending In  particular. Take a look at any reviews, how it's ratings plunged and how a fanbase that universally gushed over the show in its earliar seasons turned on it very quickly when the writing went into decline after they had no more book content to follow.","Somehow the actual story managed to bore me than any fairy tale could.  So good job on the writers for accomplishing that. Removing fantastical elements of the show just to appease soccer moms and NFL players, who ironically hated the ending just as much as majority of the fans.",I support you!!!! My boyfriend’s friend thinks S8 made sense and I want to claw my eyes out because it makes NO logical sense for anyone to think that.,"The military tactics were good and I could explain why if you’d like.

The slaver cities don’t follow Daenerys anymore, and it would take a while to get food there in time.

That was stupid I’ll admit.

She didn’t barely acknowledge her family wtf are you on? She had a whole reunion seen with Jon.

Bran would know everything, and because of that, he’d be a perfect king. And his story was great. A crippled boy dreaming of being a knight mastering his powers of green sight and being a warg and using them as long to rule the South.

If I remember the scene correctly, weren’t the ships behind rocks? If not then yes that scene’s also pretty stupid.

What? Aye isn’t a northern phrase. It’s used in the books all the time. Even a dornishman used it.

They have no reason to complain, plus their armies are basically gone. They don’t have the manpower to enforce their own opinions.","I'm also a fan of the books and the show, up until the last two seasons I defended it against all detractors.","Bring me the actual statistics of the amount of fans who disliked the season and I’ll believe you. His may be had for you to process, but not everyone spends time making reviews and ratings, and people like to review bomb by making multiple negative reviews. Also, usually it’s the people with negative opinions who make reviews.","No, it means that you have a shorter attention span and prefer action and endings with no real effort put into them.

And again, just because you surround yourself with people who hate season 8 doesn’t mean most fans do.","Listen, what happens at Harrenhal stays at Harrenhal.

Ramsay is.",What do they do?,"More or less, sure. Although Roose is also an antagonist for Stannis. And we don't know how much more important he will become in the future. But so far, yes Ramsay is more important to the plot. Both in ACoK where his identity is a major plotpoint and a twist, and in ADWD where he becomes integral to Theon's backstory and character arc. So yeah, Ramsay is more important right now, but since we don't know the whole plot yet it is hard to say that Roose is somehow unimportant.","Want Roose a major player in the red wedding though?

If you want to give yourself the Genius trait you type:

add_trait genius 100

If you want to give yourself more money you would just type:

He's a shagger. He enjoys war and has a temper but how much of his later angers are due to being under Cersei's thumb? What happens in a world where Robert is allowed to be Peak Robert?

In this scenario, Aerys led troops and was captured very early on. Rhaegar was raising taxes at the Red Keep so quickly sieging it gave me him, his kids, his wife, his mum.

War over. But it was a war where Lannisters and Tyrells joined the Targaryens, so no Cersei marriage.

It was also a war where Ned tragically died at the ToJ, and Lyanna and her son go abroad. However Lyanna returns to the North days later.

So, what do I feel Peak Robert does? He executes Aerys. Moreover, he spares Rhaegar, having spoken to Lyanna, who he is fixated on. Sparing Rhaegar is the price of Lyanna's hand. Rhaegar joins the Night's Watch and Lyanna and Robert are wed.

But, Robert is petty. And a charmer. He broods on taking everything that could be Rhaegar's. 

Rhaegar's mother Rhaella is seduced. Then Elia. Rhaegar's children are with the Celtigars. Robert by happenstance has a bastard off of one of the Crabb daughters. This comes in handy later.

(Robert has a lot of bastards)

When Rhaenys and Aegon come to the right age, Robert becomes their guardian. Aegon is won over by being Robert's squire in many tourneys. Rhaenys is seduced, and gives him a bastard. Aegon was raised alongside Robert's Celtigar bastard, and matrilinially marries her. Robert marries Rhaenys to his heir Eddard (awkward? yes)

It was Tywin that extinguished the Targaryens with blood. Robert, Peak Robert, did it with charisma and virility. Targaryens weren't wiped out, they were subsumed into the warm Baratheon embrace.

Sidenotes: LP Stannis married Cat Tully and has lots of kids. Renly got Summerhall and married Arianne Martell. Robert had two Ironborn bastards with a Goodbrother lover who I hope become reaving legends. Cersei has Jaime and Robert as lovers. Jaime and Robert are best friends. It's not awkward. Lyanna stomached all this for Rhaegar but came to love Robert. Then fell out of love with him. But in the end one tourney became best friends. They had lots of lovely kids together. Lord Commander Rhaegar died and Robert felt something like a loss. Robert died five months later. King Eddard invited Lyanna's son from Essos to court out of love for his mother. Aemon is matri married to one of Stannis daughters. Cat likes this son-in-law of hers. Eddard is 20 and a lunatic but that might have something to do with his wife being his father's lover, with one bastard between them, and Eddard's and Rhaenys' son and heir being born when Eddard was 15. I guess that's Robert's last laugh.",Gods he was strong then,"""The Hammer is my penis""",He conquered Westeros with his penis. Truly a king out of legend.,Bobby B needs a Visual Novel + Dating Sim as much as Colonel Sanders needed his.,">Cersei has Jaime and Robert as lovers. Jaime and Robert are best friends.

And doesn't regret it.","its a blessed timeline sadly though, with Ned dead, I can't say its the perfect blessed timeline yet",">Summer vacation palace and wife which will not mind his sexual preferences is also very good deal for Renly.

About 20 years further into this playthough, and Renly has got very greedy. He declared my lunatic Eddard incapable and has ruled for at least 15 years. Eddard in this time spent his hours doing best by his bastard siblings, giving them cadet branches, land if possible, and good matches. 

Rhaenys died, and Eddard had forced on him one of Renly's daughters, in order to cement his control over Eddard. Rumour in court was that removing Eddard formally is a formality coming. But when Renly's daughter got pregnant, she in hubris was open that it wasn't Eddard's son. In a rare moment of kingship, Eddard was able to convince the High Septon to a divorce, and got the imprisonment of her lover, who he ate. 

This event broke the broken mind, but from that break, came clarity. It was only months after this that Eddard broke free from his quarters and was able to storm into the throne room, declaring himself a king fit to rule. Renly's rule was over, and he returned to Summerhall as soon as possible.

Eddard, in his late 30s, now has a life to lead. His heir, Orys Baratheon, is his 'son' but his father's bastard. He has also openly committed murders, so the possibility to send him to the Night's Watch is there, leaving Eddard's trueborn, Rhaegar Baratheon, to rule. And what of Renly? With his misrule and cuckolding daughter? What of Stannis and his faction to take the crown himself? This Stannis who sent his son-in-law and Eddard's brother, Aemon, to his death in a trial by combat. Eddard can choose, for once, his own fate.

Wait, this exists? Fascinating.","You know the patron saint of this page is Renly the Rapist, yeah?","Well first of all it is a game, and this action fits the setting.

The only reason I've used it was as a Stark in the Bleeding Years. I wasn't able to produce any heirs with my wife (who was in her early-mid thirties) and the event has a good fertility chance. Over time as a ruler of such a large realm you accrue a lot of prisoners. You usually have good characters on your council which allows you to win trials at court, and lowborn courtiers rarely initiate a trial by combat. Even then you will probably have good duelists.

Since the lowborn courtiers typically don't have family they were my only means of producing heirs so I fathered a few bastards and legitimized them.

If you read my post you’d realize I’m not justifying it but just explaining why some people do it in the game.

If you play Crusader Kings II you would know that gruesome events happen all the time. Beheadings, drawing and quartering, castration, murder of children, etc. Obviously there are different types of violence, and if this is offensive simply don’t join the subreddit or play the game.

Again, if you have any knowledge of the A Song of Ice and Fire setting you’d realize this option is certainly thematic. Does George Martin’s inclusion of these themes justify them? Of course not, only individuals of middling to rudimentary intelligence would make that claim without evidence.

I don’t think castrating should be at the top of people’s lists either if I’m being honest.","For sure, but it is idiotic to try and frame my explanation for why some people use the action as defending something in real life.

You've been playing too much.",Oh boy!,"If there's one thing I'd add or change to the mod, it'd be making a few minor tweaks to the combat system.

Right now we have: poor fighter (+2), trained fighter (+4), skilled fighter (+6) and formidable fighter (+8).

This is a fine list but it feels a bit constricting. Formidable isn't nearly as impressive enough compared to the other bonuses, plus while it's very difficult to get it, it's still fairly common enough that several characters often get it per generation.

That's okay, only I don't think it should account for everyone.

Here's what I propose: First, add a fifth tier called master warrior or something along those lines that gives (+12) and make it EXTREMELY rare. Like you might have 1 character with it in the game every 50 years or so. I'm talking 1/5000 odds or something unreal. Give it to true legends, like Aemon Dragonknight or Arthur Dayne or Daemon Blackfyre, while other amazing warriors like Jaime Lannister, Barristan Selmy, Bittersteel, Daemon Targaryen get formidable fighter.

Second, make it a slightly easier to get formidable fighter while keeping the rest at the same level. It's pretty simple to get to skilled warrior as it is already, so the others don't need a buff to chance rate.

Third, incorporate tournament wins into a way to upgrade combat skills. For example, your character is a formidable fighter and you, obviously, want to get to that master/legendary fighter status. Well, you can try to get really ridiculously lucky somewhere down the line with RNG or maybe you become tournament champion in a grand tournament 3 times. As grand tournaments are already so rare it's almost impossible to get it more than once in your lifetime, this keeps it from being a simple gate to upgrading. It also rewards players who happen to win tournaments consistently beyond simply a cash and prestige prize. Win 2 grand tourneys? You're rich but now you're really banking on the hope that there's going to be that third grand tourney that hopefully you can pull off before your character kicks the bucket. Plus, the reputation won as tourney champion 3 times in the largest tourneys of them all would easily cement you as a legend.

Formidable, skilled and trained could also all get boosts by being winners of tourneys as well. Maybe poor to trained from winning a small tourney or greater, trained to skilled from winning a medium tourney or greater at least twice, skilled to formidable from winning a grand tourney.

There’s too many formidable fighters in the game and the trait is a little devalued, and it means heroes start losing duels to people who they should effortlessly kill.

R5: First time playing as Rickard Stark in the year 8281 – my initial goal was to secure the Trident for my heirs and eventually use my alliance through the arranged betrothal between the strong and ambitious upstart Robert Baratheon and my only daughter, Lyanna, to see my house on the Iron Throne. I married off my promising heir, Brandon, to the fertile Catelyn Tully and his younger but equally capable brother, Eddard, to Cersei of House Lannister – this would assure a buffering defense should the Tyrells of the Reach join the wicked Targaryens once the inevitable war for the Iron Throne began. To secure any doubt on the alliance between House Stark and Tully I married myself to Hoster’s second daughter, Lysa. As it turned out, I played myself right into tragedy.

In the infancy of my marriage to Lysa, news of her quick pregnancy brought a new vigor to my aging bones. However, this joy quickly soured as rumor spread that another man provided the seed for her untilled soil. That man was a lord, yes, but just a boy, a neophyte from Midlor Point deep within the Eerie. Who was he in comparison to a Lord Paramount?! I confronted Lysa but she angrily denied it all – and further search into the matter was disregarded as meaningless gossip. Threatened with the prospect of losing face, I sent a passing insult to the man named in the rumor – hopefully this would be enough to quell any sign of my apparent weakness. This action, however, stirred the anthill at my feet, and soon plot after malicious plot bit at my heels. False words fell into Robert Baratheon’s ears of my slandering against him, weakening our bond. Winterfell shook with the news that my youngest son, Benjen, had died under suspicious circumstances. My depleted prestige soon tainted my budding relationship with the ever-wary Tywin Lannister. To make matters worse, despite the proficiency of my young spymaster, Roose Bolton, rumors of Lysa’s adultery once again took flame like the wildfire of lore. I could no longer stand idle as the Stark name faced ruin. On the last days of Lysa’s pregnancy, with the backdrop of the looming dawn of war for the Iron Throne drawing near, I cornered Lysa a second time. This time she confessed all. The true father’s name defiantly escaped her lips – Petyr Baelish. The one they call “Littlefinger.”

My suspicions were at last validated…but any relief offered by this revelation quickly turned to contempt. Enraged, I immediately imprisoned Lysa in the deepest of Winterfell’s dungeons – its darkness only matching that of her treacherous soul. I was certain that her trial would reveal the adulterous whore to the whole of Westeros, and perhaps gain sympathizers to my cause in the wars to come. To my dismay, however, she demanded a trial by combat. My once dearest friend and brilliant master-at-arms, Brynden Tully, was called forth. Weakened and maimed from recent melees, both myself and my heir, Brandon, knew that crossing swords with the Tully legend would bring about only one conclusion. A voice spoke up from beside me, boyish but bold. It was Eddard. “I will stand for you, father.”

The night before the trial by combat was a restless one, as any outcome to the event would be most unwelcome. The following morning in the courtyard of Winterfell, Eddard, grasping the weirwood spear I gifted him for his wedding day, and Brynden, cloaked in his infamous black armor, circled one another. Bound by blood, marriage or employ, both Stark and Tully lines were represented in the gathered crowd. Despite whispered prayers from Catelyn and Lysa’s lips, it was young Eddard, powered by the cold anger of the North, who at last struck down the Blackfish. The weirwood spear still lodged in his throat, Brynden flopped about like a fish out of water, his gurgling gasps for life drowned by the wails of the Tully women. The life had not yet drained from Brynden’s face when my bodyguards, Hother Whoresbane and Osric Umber, took hold of Lysa’s chains. All the two Tully sisters were afforded was a passing embrace before Lysa was taken to the block. Despite my injuries I took Ice in my hand. It felt heavier this day than any I could remember. It was strong, Stark words that brought me strength…the man who passes judgement should swing the sword. Ice fell neatly on Lysa’s neck before the sun set that black day, killing both mother and illegitimate child in one act.

While the stain of blood on the grounds of Winterfell would quickly be kicked away by my courtiers, it was not so easily removed from my name. Any chance of plot against this “Littlefinger” was thwarted by the web of secrecy he enshrined himself within. My revenge on that bastard would have to wait, as I now rested my steely gaze on Riverrun. With no reprieve between our great houses, Roose assassinated Hoster Tully’s only male heir, Edmure, in a final ploy to gain the Trident without war. Bittersweet was this brief victory, as soon my own son, Brandon the heirless, perished from his melee wounds. His wife, Catelyn, did not mourn. Stressed, depressed, cuckolded, and severely maimed, not even the thickest of furs kept my aching heart from turning cold. My final thoughts were that of empty coffers and unfilled revenge. I was careless. I had allowed the enemy in…that is how I would be remembered. I soon followed my first son into the crypts of Winterfell. Disgusted by her sister and uncle’s demise, and given no valid reason to stay in the unwelcoming northern capital, Catelyn returned to her home in Riverrun – she would soon find another suitor amongst her father’s lesser lords and serve as heir to the Trident.

With his sister, Lyanna, virtually a world away in Storm’s End, I now controlled Lord Paramount Eddard Stark. The lone wolf of Winterfell. My deceitful and ruthless wife, Cersei, watched from the balcony as I relentlessly trained my soldiers in preparation for the inevitable war for Robert’s claim on the world. I had given her little attention since my father and brother’s deaths. Only one thought occupied my mind…winter was coming. Cersei slowly sipped the warm wine from the wooden cup I had given her on our wedding night. How she longed for the golden goblets of Casterly Rock. She sat the cup down and reached into the cage by her side. The raven fluttered in her hands and then took flight into the cool air, her message bound within its feathers. Her green eyes watched as the raven disappeared into the clouds, beginning the long journey to the White Sword Tower and into the awaiting paws of her golden lion. Cersei’s hand caressed her distended belly, and a smirk creased her fair cheeks. Little did Eddard know…his real battle had just begun.",Cersei is probably cheating on you with Jaime.

GIVING BIRTH TO THE! The.. dragonspawn of that bastard Taegon!

Taegon took everything from me, I'm Stormking but do you think that makes me happy? No! I wanted to be a loyal vassal to a good King, I wanted to be Lord Paramount not King! I wanted.. my wife to not give birth to the foul seed of Taegon…..and I didn't want her to die while doing it.

The dragonspawn born of...Silver hair...Violet eyes.


I can only the imagine what the others said when I crushed the babe with my mace Stormbreaker. 

I don't care what they say, I killed the bastard blackfyre like the rest. I killed every last dragonspawn, I destroyed their terrible influence on Westeros and all men are free. Andals, Rhoynar and Firstmen. We are all free from their greedy, horrible, terrible clutches! 


I will never have her back but I had my revenge. ","You could not imagine how infuriated I was.

I crawled myself to the top, once the Baratheon's got themselves killed I quickly found myself taking the Stormlands for my family Stormborn. I worked day in and day out to make the Stormlands a prosperous nation. The lords of the land see my house as the true successors to the Stormmen, not the bastard dragon spawn that dared to call themselves.. 'Stags' 


And all of this, to have Taegon do this to me? The dragonspawn got what they deserved, every last one of them. Rip them out root and stem until every dragon is just dust in the wind. ","I killed her in front of the darkspawn that called itself Taegon. 

Then I killed his son.

Then I killed his daughters. ","Through friendship, cunning, and a massive loan from the Iron Bank I assembled my alliance. I had the favor of the noble house Hightower, prideful Castamere Reyne's and the cold as winter Starks but I had to purchase the rest. It didn't matter how much it cost me, I would have paid anything to get my revenge.


The war lasted seven years, much longer than I anticipated. 


The lords of Castamere had their forces wiped out nearly the instant the war started thanks to a massive vassal revolt in the Westerlands, making the house Brax the defacto Wardens of the West. House Brax was loyal to the crown, the Violet Unicorn showed its sympathies after dealing with the Red Lion. They joined the war for their.. pathetic king. 


House Tully sided with the Dragonspawn and were crushed for it, the combination of being sandwiched between brutal Stark infantry and the powerful Arryn Cavalry was too much for them. Soon the pitiful remains of the Tully army had marched south to meet up with the Royal army. 


House Hightower, Martel and my own house, Stormborn. Quickly set out to crush the Tyrells. While the quality of their commanders are questionable, the quantity of their troops is not. 42 thousand Greenlander troops met our army of 40 thousand. We had the superior commanders and house Tyrell was crushed, they even lost the lord Simon Tarly in that battle. Just like the fishlords their army ran away to join their false king. 

Once all of the rebels army's got to the crownlands it was clear the remains had amassed an impressive force. The entire royal army of a mere 16 thousand was untouched and fresh, as was a large Brax host of 24 thousand. Combined with the stragglers of the other forces Mad King Taegon had a force of roughly 60 thousand troops. 


We met them on the field of battle. We beat them. Sieged Kings Landing. The war was over. 


I had the Unicorn gelded. The Rose picked. And the Dragon exterminated.

Westeros was free.  
",Two hundred years. ,"Fuck the God's. They did nothing to help me, they sat back and let Taegon ruin my life.

The Storm God gave me vengeance, he gave me the strength to see my revenge through! I have only one God, he who sits in the sky's, the one who is the storm, the one who will bring the rain. The one who brings Thunder and Lightning to us below.


The true God smiles down upon me. Tell me, do the God's smile on you?
",Should have been honored,Ah so you took Thanos's advice and went for the head with your stormbreaker,"""He started a war to win her honour back, he killed Taegon, but she died anyway""",Should turn KL into a pile of rubble and ruin too tbh,You should have at least kept one of the daughters.,">Not  keeping his dauthers and sister/wife imprisoned so you can ""visit their chambers"" in jail forever

Dude, do you even tried?


(Good done btw. And its the first time I heard about the First Night laws doing something. I never get events of that)","Damn, this just shows the storytelling potential of CK2. This fits so well into Game of Thrones, it's actually rather ironic that a Stormlander rises with the Starks and Arryns after his love is raped by a Dragon.

Your writing is good. You should write an AAR of the prelude and the actual war. It could cover at least 3 parts, and this sub desperately needs more.

Is there anything left of the Targs or Blackfyres?",What start date?,Damn Imperials,"Should ask if it smiles on your wife....o you can't ...how about your son?....wait he is not yours ,...maybe if you have taking the blessing, life would have blessed you.","The original dragons, the Targaryen's have been gone for some time. I'd say in the sixty or so years range. 

The Blackfyres did something I consider to be rather unlucky, they typically only had one or two heirs at a time. The various dragonspawn would only have one, two or maybe three children at a time. So it was easy to eradicate them completely. 


As for an AAR for this? Mm, I feel a tad bit spent on this. I played it for so long and I'm not sure I want to do anymore with this story...


But a new AAR? Hmm. I've never done one, but perhaps it is time to do my first AAR. I'm sure this subreddit would love it.
","Nine penny kings start date. 

Maelys got lucky and captured the king, then the Blackfyres had an unstable realm for a while but Maelys produced an heir that the coinflip favored.

Rhaenys killed Visenya, was exiled as a result, she married some dude in North Valyria (Elyrian culture) and her kids with him were Elyrian culture too (Matri marriage, so still Targs).

Promptly took King's Landing with Stannis being an awesome commander, got crowned, put down a Lannister rebellion and revoked the West and Casterly Rock.

Then, just as if it was nothing, I got f**king shadow-killed out of nowhere and Stannis got the crown. It was not game over but the Mannis had been definitely been playing some four dimension chess in his spare time","Ah, but more importantly, did he accept the peach?",You should buy a lottery ticket. That is a very rare event.,"If only my Robb the Lucky Wolf playthrough started a bit earlier, it'd perfectly fit in it. Lucky one.","""Not that I don't appreciate this elder brother...but wtf did u see in the flames!""",If this would happen and then at some point Renly bites the bullet and impregnates Margery it would result in a very happy and stable Westeros. Think of the next generation. Their kid would have the Iron Throne and be backed by both the Stormlands and the Reach. And even though Renly had no right to the throne he would have been a very beloved King and we already know that Margery makes a very well loved Queen. It’s like the happy ending the books could have. Plus think about how good looking the new dynasty would be with those two as their founders. That kid might end up drowning in Court Pussy,">Stannis' claim rested on the word of a dead man and naught else.

You can discredit even the most strong-looking claims if you *spin it right*. Hell, you can argue that Renly had a better legal claim than Stannis. In fact, I'll do it right now:

1. **Every king that has sat on the Iron Throne have followed the Seven**; even Aegon the Conqueror himself felt compelled to worship the Seven. Stannis is a heretic who worships a foreign god.
2. **Stannis has only a daughter.** Under the precedent set by the Great Council of 101, **""regardless of seniority, the Iron Throne of Westeros could not pass to a woman, nor through a woman to her male descendants.""** Should Stannis be king, Renly is more than likely to inherit after Stannis' passing anyway, so why not crown him king immediately?
3. While Stannis was granted Dragonstone, a title traditionally held by the heirs to the Iron Throne, we should remember that the significance of the title stems from the fact that it was **their House's ancestral seat prior to their ascension to the Iron Throne. Renly was named Lord of Storm's End, the ancestral seat of the Baratheon dynasty before Robert's ascension to the Iron Throne,** and a vastly more important and powerful title than Dragonstone at that. In a way, Robert favored Renly over Stannis. The Lord of Storm's End was the head of House Baratheon for nearly 300 years: therefore **Renly, in the case of Robert dying without any legitimate issue of his body, is now the head of House Baratheon.**

I could probably find more things to spin, but all I'm saying is: You don't need to have the most airtight claim in order to be legitimate, you just need a reasonable-sounding rationalization.",Blessed timeline,What submod are you using for the faces?,"How dare you betray the true king of westeros, the mannis, 30 odd times!

You just went off in a completely different direction.,"For over a decade Euron Greyjoy harried Westeros and the world at large with longship, dragon and fell magic.

It is hard to describe how twisted and evil Euron was. A wielder of profane magics, he reformed the faith of the Drowned God; Installing himself as a living god and teaching his priests some of his magical knowledge, while promoting the most bloodthirsty and cutthroat aspects of Ironborn society. 

Hundreds were drowned in magical rituals to fuel his spells. People were possessed or cursed with sickness and madness for sport.

Slavery was introduced to the Iron Isles and whole noble houses enslaved and sold- and thousands of small folk as well. 

Almost all the nobility of the Reach and the Riverlands was displaced over the years and replaced with fanatical and violent Ironborn. 

The only reason Euron doesn´t have more children is that he was far too busy raiding around the World with Rhaegal or had to put one scheming vassal after the other down. He was notorious for gathering magical artifacts and books of dragonlore, his pet project being the creation of mind controlled dragon riders. (Basically; Make a province with dragon intel your capital, build a dragonpit, give valyrians/members of your dynasty a dragon egg and books which increase the chance to hatch and tame dragons and then possess them.)

All the while he ignored the Wild Walkers, who keep the rest of Westeros busy in an endless War. Most of the North has fallen, the War for the Dawn a bitter stalemate. Thousands die in a frozen wasteland, protecting their homes and all living beings.. Unprotected homes and living beings which keep getting violated by the bloodthirsty and sorcerous ironborn.

And then; The great ravager, the vile sorcerer, the mad god, the first storm and the last died while giving in to his inner ramsay, his head smashed in by a poor peasant girl with a rock in some unnamed forest.

But, oh well. His son Vickon is definitely his fathers son and is happy to continue the legacy of the dragon riding sorcerer god.","well, he wouldn't be the first greyjoy to be slain by a no-name woman - Dalton the Red Kraken got his throat slit in his sleep by a salt wife.",I like how it uses the art for being gifted a hunting dog,"Nice, is this from the event about choosing to claim First Night rights on a peasant couple?",See this is why I kill them first...,Rewind time,">  in some unnamed forest.

The phrasing of the original comment could have been phrased better. That is all",You’re such a trollop,"R5: I did all of this using the Play as a Courtier Mod. Starting as a custom character, I picked a Baratheon cadet dynasty as Robert's bastard and moved to Stannis' court. I was Ser Garron Stormhart, and I supported Stannis' campaign for the Iron Throne and fought for him against Joffrey. Meanwhile, I started to invite the most useful characters to my court, and ended up with a nice enough team of third sons and lowborns, which also made for some good commanders I could use. But then the Lannisters captured Stannis. He was blinded, tortured, and sent to The Wall. Luckily, Melisandre and I had become friends before, so she joined my court when it happened, which in turn gave me a pretty good spymaster. Shireen inherited Storm's End and became my liege. I didn't care for that at all, so I decided to plot some small vengeance against Joffrey - I also hated the bastard's guts, as any man should. I then moved to his court (in order to make it more ""believable"", I actually send my troops from the court I'm in, to the court I want to go to, before I change lieges). As I joined him, I ended up having to fight against Robb's forces, and lost all of mine, which meant I had to start over from the beginning, but that gave me some time to do what I wanted. First, I tried to have a place on the council. When I achieved that, I actually seduced Margaery and got her pregnant, just because why the hell not? Meanwhile, I managed to actually get enough Plot Power (thanks Mel - also Varys died of poor health), and the insidious Lannister inbred king died even before Margaery could have had her baby. Tommen inherited, which meant yay, they're back to regency, my job here is done. I then moved all the way to Highgarden, because of course, I very much like Mace. No, not really, I just wanted to marry Margaery. So, I did that. Found a way to get a favor from them, a bit of this, and a bit of that, married her. In the meantime, for some reason I can't remember, I soured my relationship with Mace and moved back into King's Landing. This one time just to kidnap Myrcella and have a Lannister hostage. For roleplaying reasons, I avoided doing things that were way too obvious in order not to ""break their trust"". There's no way they wouldn't have known who kidnapped Myrcella, which meant that once it was done, I'd have to leave. Buuuut, Aegon landed with the Golden Company before it could happen, so I noped the fuck out of there. They had enough problems already, no need for me to lose my head. To Dorne it is then.

When in Dorne, I noticed I had enough gold and enough men to fund my way to Essos. I decided to roleplay as a mercenary then. I would gather enough men and gold around the Free Cities for some time, until I had enough to conquer a small realm for myself and the ones that joined me in the beginning. Which was quite fun. That's how I actually ended up in Meereen and found Daenerys. First, I started with Tyrosh, joining their court and fighting for them in a war they were fighting against Lys. When the war was over, I moved my troops to any other nearby ruler who had an interesting enough war going on. That way, I ended up going from Tyrosh, to Lys, Volantis, and even fighting for some minor lords. Sure enough, I ended up gathering a few thousand men that were most of the times enough to tip the scales of the wars we joined. But I think I was in Volantis when Daenerys declared war against my liege. Obviously, I decided: Nope. Couldn't get any money from that one. Quickly enough, I gathered my men and hired some ships - To Meereen it is! We'll fight for the Dragon Lady. And sure enough, we did. She managed to send us all over Essos in her liberation wars. We also fought against some Dothraki raiders that invaded her lands from time to time. And of course, being the son of King Robert, I was a good enough fighter. But not only, the mighty Bobby B blood in my veins just started talking to me about the Dragon Lady: you should do it, you know? And I thought, well... Why not? And I did it. It wasn't simple, she was a commander for most of the time, but sure enough, I knew how to cajole women. Neither my wife nor her husband were happy when she got pregnant and confessed the affair. Even worse, that happened just as she declared her war for the Iron Throne against fAegon VI. I wasn't going to cross the Narrow Sea back to Westeros, but I did stick around Meereen for a while, fighting against some Dothraki and other enemies. When the white-haired boy was born, I asked for legitimization, which our good queen quickly accepted. It didn't take long until she sat on her throne. When she did, my company and I finally crossed the Great Grass Sea, going North into the lands of Sarnor so that we could finally have a realm of our own. But that now is a whole other story.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: Playing as a courtier, I caused as much chaos as possible for the Lannisters in Westeros.

It's a great mod if that's what you want to do, but it's not for every playthrough.","It does allow for a more diverse type of playthrough. I think it all depends on how much you want to roleplay, and what are the features of the game itself you'll want to explore. Seeking dragonlore as a travelling valyrian, for example, was one the best ones I've done. I think I've also seen someone talking about a Varys run with this mod, which indeed, sounds very interesting. I do hope it works out for you when you try it!",With a mod.,Its the first result on google if you type 'Play as a Courtier Mod',"Yes, I started in the Clash of Kings bookmark. I had the legit bastard trait, and of course, house customiser. I clicked on Stannis and selected nephew, that made my character Robert's son. If it's not showing up for you, I can only think it might be because of your character's age. The relations only show up if your character can be logically related to the one you chose. You could try making your character younger to see if it works.","That's the one! I use the alternate version for Valyrian characters though, but I do think most of the women's faces could be better with this pack, especially Dany's, yes.

He didn't punish Tywin, which caused a rift between him and Ned, calling the murder of the children ""war"". He was quite upset with Stannis for not taking Dragonstone before Dany and Viserys were spirited to Essos.

He recognized the need to eliminate the Targaryens as claimants to the throne behind which his opponents could rally. He was just never in a position to kill them in a way that fully laid blame at his feet.",... Doesn’t Varys attempt to have Daenerys killed at Robert’s behest?,What? The reason Ned quits his position as hand of the king is specifically because Robert wants to kill the Targaryen siblings. [Or did you forget this entire scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL9_w1yNCSc)?,Which is still pretty threatening if you ask me,"Idr, I think it was some duke (excuse me, high lord) that told me that a maid will smother her. I’m pretty sure he was in the plot though",Thank the gods.,"In fairness with the Targaryen babes Robert was in an extremely difficult position. He couldnt exactly punish an extremely powerful 'loyalist' kingdom for supporting him in killing rival claimants. He should have at the very least condemned the method of killing them though and called Tywins men to trial for the murder of Elia which was rather unnecessary (i mean it all was but anyway).

He recognised the potential threat of the Targaryens, but he also recognised how the Rebellion had essentially drawn their teeth and with Roberts success against the Greyjoys he had united the realm (albeit briefly).

Im going to assume that last sentence is typoed. Robert would be looking for a way to kill them without copping the blame. There were always ways he could have killed them and totally taken the blame.","After she marries the most powerful man in Essos, Khal Drogo.","Again, this was after Dany married the most powerful man in Esssos. Robert could have killed both Viserys and Dany before very easily but he didnt until Dany 'secured' an army of 40k city smashing Dothraki.",For bessie and her tits.,With an army terrified of water ...,"IIRC he didn't believe in her dragons, so this made her no more of a threat than she previously was - Dothraki have never crossed water, and they don't siege cities. She had no way of getting an army across to Westeros.","Army terrified of salt water

The dothraki hate water they're horses can't drink","She didnt have dragons back then for one. Whilst Robert lived there were no dragons. Did you forget that entire plot point?

That doesnt change the fact that Viserys and Daenerys now in theory had the most powerful army in Essos at their disposal that if it landed in Westeros could totally destroy the 7 Kingdoms (they dont need to siege to reduce the 7 kingdoms to a raided wasteland).

Yes she did. It was known to Robert that the various magisters of the Free Cities had harboured her and kept her safe presumably in exchange for promises. Acquiring ships would not be difficult if she promised the magisters wealth power etc.","Yeah, I know. My point was more that they wouldn't cross the narrow sea as far as Robert Baratheon knew because the narrow see is salt water. 

Khal Drogo was no threat as long as he stayed in Essos.","My bad, but in that case there's even less of a reason to fear her.

And 40 thousand Dothraki could by no means destroy the 7 Kingdoms, in any sense of the world - that's if they actually got across the Narrow Sea, which they wouldn't, and if they had ships to do so, which they wouldn't, as the Dothraki don't siege anything - making them the worst army in Essos, considering the entire rest of Essos live in walled towns.

And acquiring enough ships for **40,000 dothraki and their horses** is incredibly hard, especially for someone with no money or power except a bunch of sea-fearing horsemen who don't siege settlements.","Yeah they wouldn't cross under drogo I despite his posturing 

At which point Dany is at least to the seven kingdoms a clawless fireless dragon","She doesnt need 40k. An army of 20k (the Golden Company used sellsails to transport that kind of numbers) would reduce the 7 Kingdoms to a smoking wasteland.

If Dany lands with an army, she will be supported by Dorne at least.","No, they simply wouldn't.

Ignoring the massive issue with actually transporting Dothraki across the Narrow Sea, and the massive issue with getting that many ships, supplies, and crewmen, there is still the massive issue that along with Robert, Ned, Edwyn, Tywin and Renly would all very likely defend the Iron Throne, along with possibly Mace and Lysa, considering the rest of the Kingdoms are backing Robert.

The Dothraki would not stand a chance, especially considering the Kingdoms would know where they would land pretty easily thanks to Varys (who does not support Daenerys), or basically any of the thousands that see the ships come past. Their armies could slaughter them before they've even recovered from the life-changing event that would be Dothraki crossing the Narrow Sea to Westeros, tens of thousands of kilometres from their homeland, to fight in long sieges for some random person.","Transporting is not a damn issue. The magisters would pay to get rid of a massive army of Dothraki, the Free cities have massive merchant/military fleet. Dothraki are regularly paid massive prices to go away. All of this makes for an easier trip.

The Dothraki still pose a threat. They are known for destroying landscape (which armies and fortresses live off) and laying waste to  an army in the open field. Almost all conventional 7 Kingdoms warfare involves throwing troops at one another in said open fields.

The Stormlands is extremely vulnerable to coastal invasion as they dont have a fleet and the coast isnt heavily populated. Thats why 3 Blackfyre Rebellions landed there. Thats where Dany would land. And there is no guarantee Varys would tell Robert. He might not support Dany but he never supported Robert either.

Everything after that is narrative argument and cant be used. I imagine Dothraki would recover once on land again pretty quickly and welcome new conquest and conflict (something they actively seek). That 'random' person is the wife of their Khal who is their king and the mother of their future leader. Dont be dense.

My point being the Dothraki still pose a threat. More of a threat than Dany ever was previously and probably the Targs best hope at winning the throne back. Until that point the remaining Targaryens were toothless and totally without threat. With an army behind, possible support of magisters of the Free cities, Dany became a threat. 

Perhaps not a threat that would be guaranteed to win against Robert, but still a threat that would take troops, money and time to take down when it could be resolved more simply by assassination. With Viserys and Dany, Robert showed a rare sense of pragmaticism (albeit ruthless and almost cruel). They werent worth his time until they actually got an army.","Okay you have a fair point for arranging transport, so I'll leave that.

The Dothraki live off the land though, what they'd be destroying is villages etc., which would certainly be very damaging to Westeros if they could do so on a large scale.

Let's say they arrived at the Stormlands. Varys wouldn't need to tell Robert, though he probably would as he does want a stable and peaceful realm. Remember, he supported murdering Dany straight away.

And it is fair to assume the Dothraki would recover from their voyage before the Kingdoms have mobilised.

&#x200B;

But now 20k/40k Dothraki are facing most of the Kingdoms in open war. These Kingdoms still being led by good leaders, e.g. Tywin, Randyll, Robert, Ned/possibly Robb, and the Vale also has a good leader though I can't remember his name. Think he's lord of the Bloody Gate, or maybe Bronze Royce. Regardless, that's it.

20/40k Dothraki and the army of Dorne vs the armies of the North, the Westerlands, the Riverlands, the Stormlands (slightly scattered to begin with), and likely the Reach and the Vale. And the Crownlands of course.

&#x200B;

Each Kingdom, on average, can field around 45 thousand men ([link](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Military_strength)). The Reach can field almost double that, while the Crownlands only 10-15 thousand, and the Stormlands 30 thousand. (GRRM has said that the North, Vale, and Dorne are about equal in military numbers).

But that's still 45k+45k+45k+30k+15k = 180 thousand, + potentially 90k+45k = a total of 315 thousand soldiers, though not all at the same spot to begin with. This is against 40k+45k = 85 thousand for Dany.

Dany has no good military commanders, though Dorne likely has. But they'd be up against the likes of Tywin and Randyll. I don't think they have much of a chance. With leaders like that, the armies are not just charging at each other.

Playing as Doran, sit out Wot5K, Aegon invades early, Joffrey deposed by Stannis which makes Aegon's war invalid for some reason. Aegon now floating about, marry him to Arianne. Fabricate that Mace is traitor and then that Stannis is plotting against Mace. Mace declares war on Stannis and deposes him for Shireen. I then press claim on IT for Aegon, while plotting to kidnap Shireen, kidnap her and force her to abdicate, not one life lost in battle. Aegon Targaryen now sits on the throne, with Rhaegar Martell as his heir.

Pure satisfaction.",And every ending better than the one in reality,"So true, so true",I wouldn’t be surprised if Cersei will fall out of a balcony is all I’m saying,"Current game has a descendant House Thenn that inherited the vale through some marriages, took dragonbinder from the Greyjoy’s to get drogon, then eventually declared independence and pressed a claim on the north after. 

Then as a member of the alchemists guild I eventually become immortal, converted to Valyrian religion, and become a God King. 

Gotta love this mod",In how many of those did Daenerys win the throne?,"You mean Euron Greyjoy, King of the Iron Throne, doesn't seduce Asha into becoming his Salt-Wife, and making Arianne Martell his wife while Roose Bolton and Janos Slynt fight the White Walkers off?","You mean God King Robb of the North, Trident, and Vale right?","I was playing as Jon Snow and I married Tyrion and Daenerys and gave them a castle up north. Daenerys left Tyrion with her dragons and became a wildling queen. Then she took her dragons and tried to take the north, lol


Then the game updated so there went that.","Aw! I don't know why but in my games, Aegon usually doesn't last longer than five minutes before he gets killed. In my current playthrough he was imprisoned by Joffrey right away. And I don't get backers to get plot him out.",I wouldn't be surprised if she gets penetrated to death by an elephant.,"In my current game I’m playing as a Dornish lord with the aim of conquering the summer isles, converting to their religion, reforming it to have the god king and divine bloodline traits and then proclaiming myself the true Sex God of Planetos, I’m also currently doing the apple immortality quest, hopefully I can make that work since it would just add to legitimacy as a sex god.","I think Aegon suffers from the mod following the books to the letter, by that I mean, we know Aegon will likely have Dorne come to his cause, may get the Reach. So Aegon is going to be stacked further in the books and the game doesn't really take that into account. Also the fact that he has to contend with Stannis when in the books Aegon arrives at a Stormlands effectively emptied while Stannis is north.

It'd be nice if the Aegon invading event came with a choice for people to side with him or not, as in a specific one which takes into account say a new modifier like 'Targaryen Loyalist'. I know the modders have enough on their plate but I think Dany and Aegon will have historically loyal houses come to them and that isn't represented in game. Dorne should side with Aegon consistently.","Dany spends the week between episodes going to Essos and picking up the elephants with her dragon and carrying them in its mouth like a female cat carries its kittens. Then she puts the elephant down, goes and gets another one, repeats this process until each named character that survived the War for the Dawn gets an elephant. Cersei gets so mad that they have elephants and she doesn't that she forgets about the dragon and it eats her and Euron.","Thanks for that, I had no idea. And right now, I'm playing Dorne. So it's all my fault.",Playing as Aegon during the conquest and tried to retake storms end after I left it unguarded. Turns out that literally one person can hold the castle for months.

Knowing full well that Aerys can and *will* **BURN THEM ALL!!**, the normal option for winning a war against the Iron Throne (mad rush to King's Landing) isn't exactly viable. Instead, I start a plot to kidnap Aerys, knowing it won't really have much of a chance of working, but thanks to a few bribes, I actually pull it off, winning the war within 6 months. The Tower of Joy combat ends with, rather *amazingly*, Ned winning! And on top of that, with Ser Gerold and Ser Oswell dying to Mark Rysell and Howland Reed killing Ser Arthur. From Ned's Party (Ned, Holwand, Mark Rysell, Willam Dustin, Ethan Glover, Martyn Cassel, and Theo Wull), the only one to die ended up being Willam Dustin. Lyanna still died in child birth, while Ned returned home with some bastard named Jon Snow, presumably from that Dornish girl with the big tits. Must've been some kind of woman to make Eddard Stark forget his honor.


With that in mind, there's the matter of settling accounts for the realm. I basically forgive EVERYONE, except the Targaryens (although Elia's allowed to live in peace), though Aerys and Rhaegar are brought to me. I promptly order them to be hung, drawn and quartered. The three replacements for the Kingsguard end up being: Brynden Tully, Samwell Stone and Mandon Moore. The question of marriage comes up, with the most elgible lady of the realm being Cersei Lannister. However, her father sought fit not to call his banners during the rebellion. Although I will honor Twyin with the title of Hand of the King, I will not take his daughter, instead marrying her to my brother Stannis, the new Lord Paramount of Storm's End. For my own wife, I choose Ashara of House Dayne, the maiden Ned Stark danced with just before the trouble began. Some in the Seven Kingdoms call me a usurper -- but my own grandmother was cousin to the Mad King. Ashara's own ancestor includes Daenaerys Targaryen -- who's ancestor was Daemon Targaryen, the Rogue Prince -- who's ancestor was Aegon the Conqueror. Let them doubt my claim -- with a blow from my hammer, I'll crush them if they act. None will doubt the claim of my children, and their children, for I am Robert, First of my name of the House Baratheon, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Proctector of the Realm. Long may I reign. 


Also, lol I have Rhaegar's skull. ","My boy Bobby B!

My best games are always with him.","The dragon has three heads, and one of them is in Bobby's treasury.",How did you cut off his head tho?,"Bobby B, don't you think it's kind of weird Ned came back with a bastard and your dead betrothed, who was pregnant, even though the only time he went to Dorne was to get her in over a year?

Jon Connington survived a fight with Robert and Rhaegar injured Robert before getting his chest caved in.","I'm pretty sure default Robert is a Formidable Fighter  


I think OP played before Bobby came of age and thus game RNG didn't give him Formidable Fighter","Good point, Baratheon tall is much different to clegane or umber tall.","Just saying if you personally reserve formidable fighter for top three all those guys are on the same level as legendary fighters like dayne, and better then any of the umbers or cleganes.",Tall and robust arent traits?,"Jaime Lannister thinks he can beat everyone but that doesn’t mean he can.  His performance at the whispering woods showed his average ability as a commander but also his formidable fighting skill.  Just because He couldn’t make it to Robb Stark doesn’t make him any less skillful.  

What an Jon connington thought was irrelevant, because glory seeking Jon connington was with 6 other guys while Robert ran out of a brothel with just a sword and still barely got away.  In the context of the game balance you can’t have a guy with 150 combat ability running around but in book canon I think Robert was pretty formidable along with being tall and robust in his youth.","I mean in comparison to the average, Bobby B's height is much closer to that of Clegane or Umber than it is to Ned or Little Finger.","Maybe an extra few tiers of warriors, or increasing the value of those that we already have?","Lol they are if you check the trait id lol. They stand for ""giant"" and ""brawny"".","I mean the game is trying to emulate the ""reality"" in the books. I wonder if different bookmarks can have different Roberts in terms of skill. In Robert's Rebellion, Bobby B was definitely a force to be reckoned with and a few warriors could match him one on one. Crowned Stag Bobby is a trained fighter and not robust at best.","Jon is a good point, but I think the Rhaegar example still proves my point.  In-game Rhaegar mostly dies if he fights Robert, but there is still a sliver of hope to kill Robert which matches that Rhaegar did manage to injure Robert before dying.

If Robert was given the Giant trait along with Strong, Brave, and Formidable Fighter he'd be basically winning 100% of his fights even against guys like Jaime and Arthur Dayne, something that is not Lore accurate.",Lol just say giant and brawny then. And he is not a giant in the books he is just tall. Brawny is just a non genetic version of strong which would be wierd,"Young bobert is definitely robust, formidable fighter and old Robert isn’t and is also fat depressed and a drunkard so that should lower his stats enough.","Did Rhaegar wound Robert personally or was Robert wounded in the battle before hand?  I know he told his maester to help barristan before he was treated so it wasn’t life threatening but enough to keep him from riding with Ned to kings landing.  Besides that Arthur dayne was allegedly killed by howlen reed, sneak attacks or not sometimes people get lucky.","Hey dickhead, everyone else understood what was said. So either learn more before talking or go eat a shit sandwich and keep your mouth shut. Also, Ned LITERALLY described young Robert as a ""veritable giant"" so again, go eat a bag of dicks 🙂","Ehhh this is kinda of a contentious point with respect to the formidable warrior trait. I don't think Robert was a technical genius like Barristan or Arthur Dayne. In my mind he was top 10 in his youth. I would reserve formidable for like top 3 or top 5. Although, if some random character can get the trait formidable fighter, that would kinda collapse that whole ranking system, but, with the rest of Robert's traits along side formidable warrior, he would be extremely op. Like even more than Barristan or Dayne who in the books would have beat him 8/10 times in single combat. There is also the issue of Jaime. Jaime was the best natural swordsman Barristan has ever seen but I doubt he is in Barristan or Arthur Dayne's class. Jaime certainly believes he can beat anyone in single combat but that's just his arrogance. I don't get how he would beat someone as big and fast as Gregor or even Sandor (although he might have the same approach as Oberyn if he had as much experience fighting different styles and  opponents). I would say Jaime should have the robust and formidable traits, but I think the trait ""duelist"" should be very rare and have a considerable bonus and be given to characters such as Barristan, Arthur Dayne and Oberyn to differentiate them from the rest even if their opponents have traits such as strong, robust, tall and formidable.",You got seriously triggered over that guy’s confusion.,That duelist trait giving a bonus to combat ability is a great idea it would give those legendary guys a boost.

Started my playthrough as Eddard Stark just after Robert Baratheon's death. Joffrey stupidly released me from prison and thus I was able to push for a Baratheon to sit on the throne. For some reason, Renly and Stannis the Mannis supported Edric Storm's claim to the throne so I joined them in a somewhat confusing rebellion. The Battle of Stonedance wiped out most of the King's army, and thus after the siege of King's Landing, Edric Storm was proclaimed the new King (with a dodgy claim as he's a bastard). Eddard Stark returned North after the rebellion, happy that his friend's bastard son and a Baratheon sat on the Iron Throne.

It's confusing at first but read the how-to guide, play around with it and you'll be fine",I make them on this website:  [https://n.bellok.de/wikibox/](https://n.bellok.de/wikibox/),Yessir,"Thank you so much man, you can expect some from me to show up here soon!",Where should I get all the houses' shields?,Thank you!,Great stuff! Sub to r/CK2AGOTBattleBoxes whilst you're at it.,Google the House's and use the ASOIAF wiki pages to find their heraldry.,Hell yeah,I needed this in my life,"R5: This game has been an outright shitfest for me. Started as lord Ronnel Norcross of Castle Norcross – a vassal to the High Lordship og Brightwater which has three lordships in it: Brightwater, Dunnsbridge and Norcross. Bookmark is The Crowned Stag. My leaders and everyone around them have just died like flies on a bugzapper.

I started by betrothing my 11 year old son Hosman to a daughter of the high lord of Oldtown, and my daughter Tania to Samwell Tarly for the alliances of the two big neighbouring highlords (though they wouldn’t ally at first). Rather easily fabricated a claim on Dunnsbridge, got some mercenaries and took the lordship. Then shit just went south from there.

Hosman knocks the Hightower chick up real early, and at age 15 Hosman’s wife gives birth to an attractive young boy. I’m happy until I realize the kids is stillborn. Under a year later Lord Ronnel dies leaving the two lordships to a childless 16 year old Hosman, and six months later Hosman’s wife dies to an infectious wound. In my sorrow I fuck a lustful courtier, who then turns to the faith to become a septa (yeah, chicks do that with me). A couple of months after that she tells me, that she is pregnant.

This game is already fucked like anything with a pulse near Robert Baratheon, so I decide: ”Fuck it”. I get betrothed to Daenerys, so I can try to quickly spawn some heirs with a major claim and hope for the best before King Robert demands Daenerys' head and fucks it. But Daenerys dies of suspicious circumstances before she is even close to marriage age.

Now my bastard daugther is born by the lustful septa. Since I have no children I ask Robert Baratheon to legitimize the chick, which he does to my surprise. With a female legitimized bastard infant as an heir I decide it’s best to marry a lustful skank with the strong trait, so I could really pop out some kids and hope for a boy, but then I die from food poisoning at age 22 leaving Norcross and Dunnsbridge to a two year old legitimized bastard girl under regency. Another Reach High Lord guns for my titles but I shut it down. I am close to quitting by now. I betroth matrilineally to Viserys just to fuck things up further.

I work through the regency fabricating a claim for Brightwater. At this point I have an alliance with the Tarlys from my aunts marriage to Samwell and a bit of funds. I take a small loan on top to hire mercenaries and take the lordship of Brightwater giving me all three provinces and the high lordship. I am thirteen years old and I’m thinking ”Ok, this game could be something” but my regent thinks ”What a great opportunity”. So he takes the lordships of Brightwater and Dunnsbridge from me leaving me with Norcross and the high lordship. Under a year later he coups the high lordship as well putting me back to start: Castle of Norcross. Viserys arrives but King Cameron immediatly asks for me to give him up, which I do. So now I am unmarried and have lost my high lordship and two minor lordships. I’m close to quitting again.

Then I marry Jon Snow (matrilineally). Come of age and get out of regency. I save up some funds. Take a loan. Call in my allied Tarly’s and some mercenaries, and I take everything from my scheming former regent but his life (because it would give me tyranny, otherwise I had killed him by shitting down his throat). I have two daughers with Jon, and I take a chance and betroth them patrilineally to the high lords of Oldtown and The Shield Isles giving me marriage ties to three of the greatest highlords in the Reach. I think: ”Okay. I’m gonna take it easy. Make some more babies with Jon and hope my pussy spawns something with a dick”. Then Jon – like the great helper he is - decides to go and do as shown on the picture. I have no idea, if this will help me get the throne in the long run, or if the seven hells will just fall down on me instantly. But we’ll see. This is certainly a game of surprises.",I dun want it. I never 'ave!,Does anyone know a console command to fire this event?,"It's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for him. 

Seriously, though, this is the type of reason I love ck2.","The fact that killing your traitorous former regent gives you tyranny never made sense to me.

That's one of those things I'd do for RP purposes and then console-away the tyranny TBH.","I played a good Dondarrion run where I married Daenerys and pushed her claim at the behest of some faction that I had nothing to do with. I was basically one county at the time but it worked out because of the intervention of several dissatisfied highlords. She was actually a lunatic and made everyone in King's Landing wear masks, but when she died I was in power.",How do i do the jon snow into aegon thing? Win the war as feast of crows and then i get an event?,"Update:  


Jon never pressed his claim, but he knock my legitimized bastard ruler up six times. Two sons, which one of them had cancer all his life and died at 17. Things are not getting much better rulerwise. I abdicated the lordship to my son when he turned 16, so I had time with rulership focus to make him better.  


But he is now a wroth, shy, wounded and chaste drunkard, but also a charitable, fashionable and brave duelist, skilled fighter knight with a charismatic negoiator education. Married a genius girl heir to a small castle somewhere in the Stormlands, and they now have four daughters - two of them geniuses (not the eldest one unfortunately).  


Through Jon Snow I have a claim on the Iron Throne, but I am trying to figure out how to get there. Since I am not the vassal to the throne directly I can't press it, so I guess I have to usurp the Reach first. I will maybe try to get another high lordship first, as I need more land to field more men of my own. I am marrying out like crazy to build some good alliances.",Bravo.,That bastard is full of shite,shes mcqueen,I haven't seen it before. He just decided to make things interesting.,When Jon Snow knows his parentage (meets Howland Reed for example) he gets a decision to declare for Iron Throne,"Yeah. It's fun. I really wanted to quit at times, but I'm glad I didn't. Jon has produced a male heir now and haven't pressed his claim even though he asked me to fund it (ten gold :D )","I treat every evil regent the same, I antagonize them, take back all my lands, and then rival and kill every descendant they could have.

In my last game I played the Reynes and took over as Lord Paramount of the Westerlands. Things were going great until I died suddenly and my new ruler was 3 years old. My mother was lady regent but then died when I was 9 and was replaced by Lord Tarbeck. He stole two of my counties and, I suspected, a lot of money. As soon as I came of age, I ordered his arrest (even though I had no valid reason to) and he rose up in revolt. Even with his plentiful allies (including the deposed Lannisters who still held Lannisport and Casterly Rock), I crushed him and took my lands back. I let him die in the dungeons and then I dueled and killed his son and only heir. He was succeeded by his sister (daughter to the traitorous lord regent) and I left it like that because her heir was from a minor dynasty from the Riverlands.

I despise evil regents like that, but in that game it was karma because I basically did the same thing to the Lannisters to take the Westerlands in the first place. I was the grandson of Lord Tybolt Lannister and cousin and castellan to Lord Jaime Lannister and I declared him incapable with a plot and then usurped his title as Lord Paramount.","Also the fact that if someone rebels on, you can strip them of one or two titles but not all of them is fucked up. Sometimes you get tyranny for taking more than one or two. Ruling by fear is textbook medieval and your vassals should know, that if they cross you, they lose everything.

Plus: There MUST be canonical examples of people being stripped of all titles and lands. At least no example of someone being called a tyrant because of stripping more than a certain amount of titles, but it wouldn't be tyranical with less.","Yeah. It seems too random sometimes. Even though he was regent and therefore legally could do it, this is what no ruler would want from their regent, and anybody would understand. So it should not give any tyranny to execute him, when he stole almost everything from me.

By the way. There should be some guidelines you could set up for your regent on what they are allowed to do and not do.","I have tried in a House Royce run to marry her. She actually produced an heir, before she was captured giving my heir a claim to the throne.",You need to have Howland Reed and Jon Snow in the same court location and wait for Howland to trigger the event where he reveals the parentage.,I started at The Crowned Stag bookmark. So don't know. He had been my husband a couple of years before this.,And his story isn't even as good as that of Bran the Broken. SMH,"Well played! Chapeau to you!!!!

I was a Blackfyre supporter and helped Aemon Blackfyre take the throne. Unfortunately, his son and heir Aegon was married to a Lannister and hated the fact I usurped the Westerlands. Even though I helped him take the throne, Aemon and eventually his son hated me. He tried to revoke my titles every few years, triggering massive, lengthy civil wars as both Marten Reyne, who I took the title as and his grandson Darius Reyne who I am still playing as (Marten Reyne outlived all of his kids). I white peace when I can, but I mainly end up surrendering and then winning a trial by combat. Its gotten to the point where I'm just repeating the same actions over and over.

It's like their CKII after-action report consisted of ""What do we *absolutely have to ship* at launch to get people to buy the game, and what will they pay for in installments?""",Crossing my fingers,What did it taste like though?,Your line about Imperator rings true for me.  I pre-ordered and haven’t touched it at all.,"People who are new to paradox thinks Imperator was some kind of new thing, not knowing this is how every paradox game is released.

From what I have understood from my friend who works with paradox however, they took the reception of Imperator very seriously. Johan even considerated quitting the business as he felt he did not know how to make a game anymore.

I hope they learn from their mistakes and make a proper game from the start, it should be easier with ck3 due to their recent work on ck2 and its MUCH longer development time than Rome.",Paradox Interactive is a giant corporation? Since when?,What makes you think the base game will be super weak? Everything they have announced so far have been great additions and we are only two dev diaries in. And you will be able to play eastern nations in ck3 though?,Yeah! But by that time it’ll surely be out (knock on wood) and MUCH flavor will be added to the mod based on the plot given in that book. And a TWOW timeline to play with,This is literally Paradox's whole business model.,"That's what games like this are about, Europa Universalis, Hearth of Iron, Sims etc. sell same shit over again with updated graphic, each time adding even more dlcs, then chop most of it again, include 1-2 expansions into new core and sell all the dlcs again","Only chop off parts are nomadic, republics, off-map China and Sunset Invasion.   
Rest looks same (Muslims, pagans, Way of Life) and/or improvement (Cadet-dynasties, more QoL, dynamic religion, dynamic breeding) at least as far as we know.  
I will just wait for more DevDiaries to show us before blaming everything as SIMS sell again and again the same things...","Its pretty decent now if you ask me, the pop system scratches my vicky/meiou itch","It has a market capitalization of 1.2 billion USD. That's certainly not a small development business, far from a huge corporation though.","Since last 6-8 years. Days of Paradox muh small indie fan studio are long gone, they are the major shit now.

Stop cheerleading then, stop kissing their asses - they arent your friend, they will never like you, they dont care about you and they have enough asskissers in bribed gaming media, paid shill Youtubers who cream their pants everytime they release some bullshit and their own totalitarian circlejerk shithole called official forums.
 
Quality of their games went to shit, they gauge players on bullshit cut content DLC's ( and that is if they dont outright cut features from a game under the pretense of muh MP balance or muh streamlining aka dumbing down for tards - like they did with Shitlaris FTL system, CK2 assasinations etc), their newest games are complete and utter trash ( Shitlaris, HOI4 and Imperator ), they fold like tissue paper to insane identitarians etc. 

Stop deepthroating them because its part of the problem.","I was referring to CK2 holding back content to release as DLC later on. CK2's base game was actually quite bare bones which isn't up to standard of what you'd expect from a full release game.

I find it mildly infuriating that I have to spend $200 plus to be able to play with the full game mechanics. Most of the DLC releases could have been combined into a couple DLCs at most but they break it up in order to milk more money out of us.

I honestly don't mind Paradox increasing the longevity of their support by selling costume / skin DLCs over time. What goes too far is that they restrict major game mechanics that you have to pay for over time. Almost no other game developer gets away with shit like that.

That's just my opinion on the matter we can agree to disagree.",Oh sweet summer child,"Mhm. I’d definitely describe it as one of the many mid-level ones around. The big ones have like 10,000 employees, Paradox has something like 400-500.","They're market cap is a fraction of EA's and ATVI's. Paradox is tiny as far as corporations go and mistakes will hurt them far more. I totally agree though, anyone dickriding them must be a shareholder with a short term outlook or a lame ass fanboy.","Just because they aren't an indie company doesn't mean they are a ""massive corporation"". They aren't EA or Activision. Those actually are massive corporations, and only care about money at this point. Paradox still has to churn out quality if they want to succeed. So if you don't like the product, don't buy it. Is it that hard?

I know their recent titles have been shitty, that's why I didn't buy any of them. If I don't like something, I don't buy it, I'm not an idiot. All I was saying was that they aren't a massive corporation. They are like...a mid-sized developer at best. I mean, they have literally half the number of employees that CD Projekt Red has. Are they a massive corporation too?","Their relative size and power to giants like EA or Activision doesnt matter - they are still a corporation with shitload of cash to bribed reviewers, PR department to confuse and obfuscate shit etc and not some two men indie studio that one has to ""forgive"" for shit being rough around the edges, buggy or not working. 

>mistakes will hurt them far more.

Idont see that. They released three shit games in succession and nothing actually happen to them.",">They aren't EA or Activision.

Unfortunately. At least people recognize EA as cancer that it is instead of that undeserved fanboying over muh poor indie passionate Paradox.  

Yes, CD Projekt Red is a massive corporation too. Of course difference is that CD Projekt Red games dont suck twelve monkey dicks, dont assfuck my wallet for cut content and are perfectly playable in vanilla. Unlike Paradox games.

>So if you don't like the product, don't buy it. Is it that hard?

So i can reverse that - If you like the product then buy it and stop getting so assmad that someone else doesnt like it and refuses to praise it. And while you are at it - stop jerking off all around the internet about how awesome the game is before its even released. Especially if its developer has a track record like Paradox in the last years and caves in to retards demands before even god damned trailers drops.

Dont give me this fanboy doublespeak, that shit wont fly with me - im too old, too experienced and too jaded for your fanboyism.","Did you not even read my response? I said I didn't buy any of the new ones. People have a choice, you know. You aren't forced to buy things you don't want to.

Anyways, you're the one ranting like a lunatic. The only person that is ""assmad"" here is you. Buy what you want, quit being a sheep.","Yeah im sure you are totally detached and not at all butthurt Paradox fanboy. And that is why you get so assmad that people dont like Paradox and their newest titles and say that openly. 

Makes perfect sense.","I’ve just never heard Paradox described as a massive corporation before, that’s all. It isn’t anywhere near the size of the big ones.",Should have selected Victarion - IIRC he is one of the few characters with personal combat skill comparable to Bobby B.,"*Grinds teeth*

I can’t actually recall any info on how good Theon was in a fight, and we do know that Bobby B was a monster of a man, so my money is still on Bobby","Honestly, same.",Theon is known for being incredibly skilled with a bow but he was about the equal to Robb when it came to sword play,I know about the archery skill (but if it’s a 1v1 I don’t think the bow will be much use) but do we even know how skilled Robb was? Equal to Robb is pretty vague if we never see Robb Fight,They’re about as competent as your average lordling brought up with sword and shield their whole lives would be; surely much more skilled than an average peasant but not on a level to gain any sort of renown,So the type of person Ol Bobby B wouldn’t have a problem squishing,"Yeah, a renowned warrior like Bobby B would probably wreck Theon’s shit handily in single combat","16 years old! 105 personal combat skill!

In the lore there are plenty of dragonriders who meet their ends quite gruesomely. There is still very real danger.

","I only compared his personality with Maegors, didnt say that a dragon would let him ride it in the books. ","Okay no problem. I was only saying that I strongly disagree. Maegor was a cruel prick, just not cowardly. He took his dragon to personally wreak fucking havoc on the faith militant, was knighted at sixteen and distinguished himself being heavily involved in fighting at least two campaigns.

It doesn't really do that, like if they have tv characters then it goes with that, but it goes with the book if they don't have a tv portrayal of them, it has some pretty good Targaryen pictures in that respect such as Aegon I.

The portrait screams Valyrian, the red background says westerlands - even though you have a forged crown and a queensguard - and the shield looks like the Reyne's.",I think Rolph would make the best choice but that's just my opinion,"For anyone wondering, this a campaign that's been ongoing for something like 250 years at this point, staring at Aegon's conquest as House Reyne. Fairly quickly brought the Reynes to House Lannister, taking the paramountship and leaving only the Lannisport Lannisters alive. Aegon also for some reason never converted to the Seven, and he and his successor kept asking to foster my children with Valyrian men and women, so I decided to take them up on that, converting to Valyrian religion and eventually to High Valyrian culture. 

A bit later, one of my characters, Rhaenyra Reyne, was proclaimed Queen at a Great Council. She colonized Velos and invaded Matarys to get three holy sites so she could reform her religion and proclaim herself the God Queen. After that, I may have used the console to fire the first event of the immortality event chain to make her a true God Queen, but apparently the end of the martial path is rebirth, not immortality. Decided not to save scum, as this could be interesting, so I named the reborn Rhaenyra lady paramount of the Westerlands and switched to her, leaving the first Rhaenyra's eldest son on the throne. He died about 8 years later, just in time to avoid the Others invading. 

Rhaenyra managed to invade and annex the Reach without the new child queen bothering to tell her off and before Night's Watch fell. Rhaenyra committed the armies of the West to the defense of the Wall and then the North, after the Wall fell, but the Others had the numbers and commanders to win every invasion, exterminating many of the northern houses, including House Stark. The North fell to House Karstark (who later legitimized themselves as Starks), though there were only two of them left. When Rhaenyra finally turned 16, she took charge of her forces astride her ancient dragon Bloodwraith to finally win a defensive war against the invaders. She promptly declared the War for the Dawn, which was won by the time she was 19. 

After leading the defense of humanity, Rhaenyra was not going to kneel to anyone, especially not the weak queen on the throne, even if the girl was her niece. She was much beloved by the lords of the West and Reach for her able rule and by the Northmen for saving their lives and lands. Thus, when Rhaenyra proclaimed herself Queen of the Rock, not a single vassal stayed out of the war or joined their lawful liege. Rhaenyra also declared a dragon conquest of the Iron Islands (before raising any levies), to which the Ironborn acquiesced. The Targaryens of the Vale stayed out of the civil war, making the conflict four kingdoms against three (West, Reach, Iron Islands, and Northern allies vs Crownlands, Stormlands, and Dorne), which Rhaenyra won handedly. The weak Reyne queen was deposed a few years later in favor of a minor house Aegon had given Stokeworth after killing all the Stokeworths in the conquest, eliminating the truce Rhaenyra had with the Iron Throne. She thus invaded the Riverlands, resulting in the [current borders](https://i.imgur.com/gY87Gup.jpg).","I posted a description of the campaign so far under the R5. Tldr: started as House Reyne, took Casterly Rock and the Westerlands from the Lannisters, converted to Valyrian culture and religion over a few generations, had a character who was Queen of the Iron Throne (hence the crown), but this character is Queen of the Rock (and Reach, Riverlands, and Iron Islands).",He's such a good choice that he's really the only option,"Rhaenyra Reyne?

And if you convert to Valyrian faith before trying you're looking at around 95% success rate for both events (with all the available intel, that is).

I've hatched multiple eggs and tamed multiple dragons in my Ironman Velaryon playthroughs, but it always involved the tedium of sailing around the world and collecting all the intel. The thing is, AFAIK you have to already have an egg to be able to collect the intel, so I usually play with unrestricted artifact revocation and acquire eggs that way.

Apparently you can also collect the intel for other characters in your court who have an egg, in case you want to help them succeed in hatching it. You put them in charge of an army and sail them to the places of dragon lore, just like you would with your own character. You won't see the event fire, but they'll get the flag.

Finally, once you get alliance with the houses you marry off to, take on the throne since you've got 4 or 5 kingdoms against 2-3.  The reach generally keeps dorne at bay, riverlands and the vale keeps out the north while helping take on the crownlands and the stormlands if you haven't already taken them.  The bleeding years on the other hand, is quite a challenge.  The wars in essos always tend to spill over into westeros in my games and tend to ruin my plans.

Last time I got an egg went like this: some time after my assassination plot against Dany finally fired, another character tamed one of the dragons in Meereen and managed to get an egg from it. I then invaded Meereen with a huge war chest built up by raiding the Summer Isles, imprisoned the character (whom I gained as a vassal) and took the egg away from him.

* Hoster and Brynden Tully
* Jaime Lannister
* Lords Blackwood and Bracken
* lots of minor lords and commoners, 80 to be exact
* the High Septon

It also left King’s Landing as a ruined province, with house Targaryen now headed by Rhaegar I who rules from Dragonstone. With Robert and most of the major players dead, the realm went back to peace, and now Stannis has to raise the bastard son of Lyanna and Rhaegar, for some reason. Also quite a poetic touch: the George RR Martin insert character in this bookmark is rivaled to Rhaegar because his wife died in the wildfire explosion.

[Update](https://imgur.com/gallery/cmaiPkd):

Eddard Stark, Jon Arryn, Edmure Tully, Tyrion Lannister, and Quellon Greyjoy lead the anti-Targ Rebellion post-Robert, to avenge Lyanna (I guess). Rhaegar is captured, and Eddard becomes Lord Protector of the Seven Kingdoms. Now, we have a kingsmoot in Winterfell to discuss inheritance, but with KL a ruin, the Greyjoys appearing out of nowhere and supplying the fleet to siege Dragonstone, and a Stark running the throne, this *literally feels like season 8*.

Eddard won the vote to become King, and now sits the Iron Throne, with Benjen serving as Lord of Winterfell. I just...

[Update3](https://imgur.com/a/50l9f0a):

Ned tried to have Stannis arrested, but Stannis revolted, overthrowing Ned. In his two years of reign, Ned managed to create more chaos, end the Targaryen line by killing Rhaegar, send the realm 350 gold into debt, thus becoming known as Eddard “of the Empty Pockets,” and finally start a civil war that would oust him. Stannis beheaded Ned, and since Benjen had died under suspicious circumstances, house Stark now rested on the shoulders of Lyarra, daughter of Cat and Ned, aged 2. House Bolton was granted Winterfell, via Ramsay Snow. A council was summoned, and a new Queen chosen. All hail Queen Catelyn, of the House Tully, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lady of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Oh and she rules from Winterfell, which she promptly revoked from Ramsay.

Wild rild.",This is why I always siege around KL when I play Robert’s Rebellion. One time losing my 30 martial Eddard character (really good luck with War focus) was enough for me to take the extra time to siege the other crownland regions.,GRRM insert character?,Could you say the name of the outfit sub-mod please?It looks pretty good.,[deleted],"What's the graphical mod(s?) that you're using to make the water reflect the sun like that, and the continents looking like that ?",how did catelyn get disfigured and gravely injured?,"Uhh honestly wtf, I got this event myself triggered before but never witnessed so many people dying.

&#x200B;

Did the realm got thrown off into further chaos after his mess?","Lol my games just end up with a ton of lords successfully declaring independence from their lieges, completely fracturing Westeros.",A character named George Martin holds the King or Dragon Gate in Robert’s Rebellion,They’re a part of the Faces Modification submod,It’s the Faces Modification submod,I use In Heaven’s Graphical Overhaul (Dark Water),"All the commanders that were currently fighting in KL died (the Tully’s/Riverlords who died), his whole council died (a bunch of minor lords) the Kingsguard (who weren’t off fighting) died (ie Jaime and Barristan), and then all the commoners at his court died too. 
It was... a lot to deal with. In one day the ruling dynasty became one person, about 1/4 the ruling elite went up in smoke, two members of the Kingsguard, one from a prominent family, died, and the “evil king” we were all fighting also died. So it was just an awkward few months until Eddard declared war on Rhaegar. We’ll see how that goes. What a timeline.","The Greyjoys have already started a faction for independence, and the Tyrells want to depose Cat. I feel like there won’t be peace for long...","

The invasion event itself has an MTTH of 25 years, and it is designed to fire more often for the vale after 6530 and stormlands and riverlands after 6650. This means that invasions can start during the Scouring of Lorath bookmark, but just aren't as likely to happen for the first few years. If you want to fire anal.5 yourself you'll need the province id of the target. You can look them up in AGOT Andal Invasion/map/definition.csv.

It's also pretty dumb that the continent of Westeros only supposedly has five cities (though I don't know why places like Duskendale isn't considered to be on - it seems like a city from it's description in the books). GRRM seems to generally have a problem with scale and I actually think that everything would work better in terms of travel time and logistics if the scale was smaller - which I guess in a way is what the tv-show is going for.","I didn't ever notice this happening.. it fires them and rehires them..?

Bright side is we've been converting like crazy.  

Really weird side note: Lorath never got scoured this game. Somehow they managed to not only survive the dragonflame, but actually took Norvos. Qarlon's son is currently ruling while Qarlon is just some burned landless courtier. I think there was a depose war in the middle of the Lorath/Norvos war and maybe that screwed up the bigger war.","Yep, it was only 25 years in the game so I knew that Artys couldn't have been alive at that point. I glanced over and noticed that there were two Mountain and Vale kings. Artys was rulling Griffin's Roost (the Eyrie) and his opponent was some nobody. Somehow Artys lost, no idea how that happened.","The two mountain and vales are the two first man and andal alliances. I let an observe game run last night and in less than 100 years:  

* Andals conquered the vale in 6511 (33 years)
* Andals conquered the riverlands in 6536 (58 years)  
* Andals conquered the north in 6549 (71 years)  
* Andals built and have made upgrades to the Eyrie 6558 (80 years)  

No complaints, however it is kind of funny how three kingdoms have converted their cultures in less than a century, yet the Manderlys still aren't northmen. I guess the world was a whole lot less populated back then.  

*Edit: Oh, and guess who owns dragonstone.",Who owns Dragonstone? I normally see some Valyrian given control of it for colonizing but they always fuck it up.,"So a note first. There were many more commanders and important people involved but I couldn't fit them without it looking bloated. This battle doesn't really represent how chaotic this whole war was. There were battles and sieges literally everywhere in Westeros. I have never seen a war nor a single battle on this size before. The war itself took many years because of the back and forth fighting in the whole of Westeros.  


**Story time:** 

I started as Aegon Goldfyre in one of the principalities of the Summer Islands, during Robert's Rebellion. I managed to unite the Summer Islands and then created the Summer Sea Empire by conquering Basilisk Isles and colonizing Sothoryos.   


During all this, Westeros was chaotic. Robert won, but all Baratheons died out, mainly cuz I instigated assassinations of most of them. House Errol took over the Stormlands and the lords of the realm chose Rheagar's son, Aegon as king. That lasted only a year when Tygett Lannister declared war and became the new king of Westeros for about 15 years. Then he himself got deposed by half the realm and actually made the Iron Throne an electorate. They choose Doran Martell. In his 20 year reign he turned it into a gavelkind, then died which left Quentyn to be king, and his younger sister princess in Dorne. Aegon Goldfyre died, I'm now his son, Archon Goldfyre and I started my extravagant plans. I managed to get an alliance with the Westerlands, which was held by my sister who managed to actually claim it in a war because her mother was Cercei. I also got Arryn and king Quentyn's sister on my side in the alliance. But I didn't get an alliance with Aemon Targaryen, the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, who got the lordship when all the Stark men died out. 

&#x200B;

The war was intense. There were literally battles everywhere, as said before, and there were multiple dragon riders on both sides. What made this final battle so epic was because everyone seemed to just rush to King's Landing at one point, where almost everyone who was in the war, to face each other in on final battle. Massive doomstacks on both sides. The dragons who died were Aemon's Dragon and his half brother, Lord Aenys Targaryen, who was on my side (his liege was the Martells of Dorne). Both Aenys and his dragon died.",You let a Targaryen become LP of the North? You are not my king,HoI4 Westerosi Edition,"How do you do stuff like this? Because I have a really interesting a couple of battles that happened when Ned Stark got tired of Brandon Stark's shitty ruling and overthrew him, and I would like to add those to this.","Wow, this is amazing! I'm also a bit creeped out, we seem to be doing almost the same run! I started as a Targaryen bastard, picked House Goldfyre, and went south to conquer the Summer Islands and Sothoryos, and then created the Summer Sea Empire. I intend to form New Valyria, and try to put my dynasty on the Iron Throne aftewards. My heir's dragon is named Solstice as well. I guess the only big difference is that I started at the Blackfyre Rebellion, but still, Westeros was deep in chaos at the beginning.","And yea, House Piper got the trident because of Cat's marriage to a Piper lord (then Edmure decided to die childless). I have no idea how Florent got the Reach, I didn't pay attention to that region.

House Errol of the Stormlands was the only major house/region staying out of the war completely. They swore fealty to me when I won.",Haha i didn't let anything. I wasn't even part of the realm before the war x) plus he's half stark. Even more fun is that he's married to his full Stark sister. (Lyanna's daughter with a Bolton),"This was my first one too.

And his title wasn't revoked? Weird. How did he even lose when the Iron Throne forces were in permanent FFA deathmatch?","Hahah yes, I mean, late game always gets pretty boring for me, even if I have something planned too. Early game, especially with the Play as a Courtier mod is always more interesting. It's getting hard to stick to the same run for a long time now, but it's always great when it happens","I don't actually know. He kept being in internal wars as well, might be because of that. The other lords didn't like him. Both Bolton and Manderly had multiple wars against him. He was so busy, when I had my war on the iron throne, I didn't even see his forces until the last battle.","Starting as Littlefinger in the Storm of Swords start-date, I was granted Harrenhal and the Lordship of the Trident. With my own power-base now secure, I revealed and married Sansa, to strengthen legitimacy and eventually own both the Trident and the North. The marriage made for strategic reasons would soon blossom into love, during Lady Sansa's first pregnancy with their daughter, Catelyn, would did not survive her first month. Tommen ends up winning all of his wars and remaining King, but in the chaos Ramsay Bolton won independence for the North, though his rule would not last long, and with the support of some Northern houses I managed to press Sansa's claim, making her the Queen in the North. Soon Corwyn is born, a rather disappointing not-genius child, followed soon by Eddard, a genius. Things are going to plan and I'm building power, when the Iron Banks of Braavos approaches Lord Petyr with an interesting proposition to support him in a war to take the Iron Throne from Tommen, for his ongoing debts. Ever a schemer, Petyr takes his chances, backed by the North and various other lords from across the kingdoms, and before long is declared as King.

Corwyn Baelish never showed much interest in ruling, and as a teenager requested to go to the Citadel to become a maester, content to give up his claim in favor of Eddard, his father's preferred child anyway. King Petyr accepts and Corwyn joins the Citadel, but before he can even finish his first link, his father dies, and he is pressed to ascend to his throne at the age of 17. Eddard graciously accepts Corwyn's return, and is granted Harrenhal and the Trident, while after Sansa's death several years later and the reintegration of the North, Petyr and Sansa's youngest son Tormo is granted Winterfell and lordship over the North. Despite being King, Corwyn still displays much greater interest in learning and traveling to rulership or tourneys. He dedicates his reign to peace and rebuilding the realm, so that he can dedicate himself to his studies. His first wife, Mychella Hightower, Lady of Oldtown, would be tortured and murdered by Lord Tyrell during a period of war to re-establish control over the Reach, and Corwyn quickly married Alys Lynderly, his paramour, who would give him his first child within several months of marriage. Their marriage would be a long and happy one, and result in three more children. 

Most of King Corwyn's early reign was spent between Oldtown and King's Landing, hosting parties and talking with people, as the King earned upwards of thirteen links in his chain, and specialized in people and cultures. Well groomed, with a trimed and oiled moustache and hair flowing to his shoulders, hardworking, gregarious, kind, just, and charitable, King Corwyn was beloved by his subjects and foreign dignitaries alike, and in his studies of language, the King took a massive tour of the Free Cities, starting in Old Volantis and working his way to Qohor. In his later years, the King began to focus more in the occult, and took to more research on his own time. He built the Great Observatory of King's Landing, researching the stars and collecting an over-growing library, including the Necronomicon, which he spent years deeply studying at the expense of his travel. In would be in these years that tragedy would strike his family, as the King outlived his two youngest daughters. Stress began to consume him, and his travels to Oldtown became more and more infrequent, until finally the Wise king would die at the age of 53, passing the throne to his only son, Petyr. But the world he left was far different than the one his mother and father fought in. The mountain clansmen of the Vale, following the lead of House Hybukson, would seize the Vale and the Eyrie, declaring themselves the new Lords and assimilating into the culture of the mountain lords, married into and supported by House Baelish to increase their legitimacy and promote stability. The House Tarth and later house Buckler rule the Stormlands, the Oakhearts were declared the Lords of the Reach following Lord Tyrell's murder of King Corwyn's first wife, and House Dustin just inherited the Westerlands, claiming matrilineal descent from Kevan Lannister. 

A true Renaissance Man, King Corwyn Baelish led the Seven Kingdoms out of one of its darkest hours into one of its most prosperous, and ushered it into a new age.",The worst part about this is realizing that this storyline is decently realistic if Jon didn’t come back when he did and press his claim,Have a R5?,I really prefer the Baelish crest with the Titan's head.,That handsome as fuck heir.,"I doubt Sansa had a happy marriage, sleeping with the man who betrayed her father.

He was appointed Lord if Winterfell by Corwyn following Sansas death, but was quickly deposed in a peaceful coup by the Karstarks, who took the name Stark and ruled the North. Tormo was the lord of Skagos but was charged with treason by Brandon (Kar)Stark, and sent to the wall. Tormo became Commander if the Shadow Tower, and his Granddaughter Eldrane now rules Skagos.","If you’re a member of the society you can still form links but you can’t elevate to the rank of maester, so basically he was taking classes but couldn’t become a proper maester.

Corwyn hadn’t become a maester yet so he wasn’t disqualified from succession.","Stannis lost and was I believe executed by Tommen, Myrcella was sacrificed to R’hollor by King Victorian during a war between the Lannister’s and the Iron Islands during Tommens rule, I executed Tommen, who was in my prison, when the Lannister’s and Tarths of the Stormlansa revolted to press his claim.

The Seven Kingdoms became nine during or shortly after the war of The Five Kings. I started as Tywin I killed Robb in personal combat executed all of house Tully and Sansa's brothers. Since I had married Tyrion to Sansa house Lannister got control of the North and Trident.  I decided to back Stannis against Aegon and fed him to lions.  All of the lords paramount broke after Sansa crowned Stannis.  The Iron Bank gave me a loan to invade the Reach I won because Mace. Daenerys lost so I pressed her claim for fun and then she lost the Iron Throne so I matrilineally married her to Tommen. She had one daughter and a bastard son. I used Tyrions intrigue to kidnap and murder my way into the Vale and the Stormlands. I then waited and pressed claims on Vale and Stormlands and pressed Daenery's son claim after I matrilineally married him to my daughter since his father was the hound. I got Dorne peacefully through marriage after I killed the heir and Arriane. I invaded the Iron Isles and gave every duchy to the Lannisport Lannisters. Tyrion died and I played as Eddard securing Alliances with the other kingdoms. Eddard died and my daughter inherited Dorne and Lann II inherited the Rock. I married my son matrilineally into the Iron Throne and formed an Alliance I helped the Iron throne take back 3 of the Seven Kingdoms and then I got tired of waiting to be king so I console switched to Gwyneth and used the annex decision and then played as Lann to negotiate the deal a royal style and a seat on the small council.

I just wanted to show that all of the Lords paramount were Lannisters no they don't have the various bloodlines but I did manage to acquire several Valyrian steel swords through weird AI things. I can't tame Daenery's dragons I have it set to Valyrian only.","Gotta be honest, that looks pretty.",#no,Every time i close my eyes i see their blonde hairs and their smug satisfies faces.,Congrats.

wait holdup",[deleted],"Gg ez, I did a little of both for my Lannister playthrough this weekend, after about 5 generations of trying to marry into the iron throne I had successfully gotten my niece on the throne (she despised me) and assassinated 5 of her husbands to try to marry my heir to her. She was part of house Cunningham or something like that. All attempts for that marriage were unsuccessful. At the same time I had finally gotten a claim on the reach and took it over with the help of the trident, who was my cousin that squired for me and is married to my daughter, and dorne who is my uncle and was in an alliance with me since i married my daughter to his heir.(Incest was accidentally a vital part of my game) after taking the reach I married the lord paramount of the north. With the north, the trident, dorne, allied with me, lord paramount of the reach and westerlands, I declared war based on a weak claim and overthrew her. The storm lands tried staying neutral but once they saw I was winning they allied with me. The vale fought with the queen and so did the iron islands. The iron islands are the only ones I have not married into due to their refusal the entire game and are the biggest pain in my ass with the raids. But it felt good finally becoming king after years of trying, 5 generations of Lannister’s all getting lower stats and worse traits the further they got from Tywin but one was decent enough to win the throne. He held it for a few years until he died but now it’s mine",I liked it probably my favorite play through I ended up with several Valyrian steel swords between me my husband and my heir. I think I counted ten and I'm not sure how some of them got in my family I know how I got some of the swords like Longclaw and Brightroar. I reforged ice because I got the event to. My kin forged some and I granted them to me just to see how many I had.,Yes before I revoke your titles considering I made your house lords of mandervale,Well the main line has two strong seed bloodlines so they'll either be blondes or Valyrians too bad they don't have the culture taming dragons would be easy with the bloodlines from the more blood lines mod,A Clash of Kings I used the console move Sansa and Tyrion to my court and removed his widowed trait the original plan was just to win the war for house Lannister but then Sansa crowned Stannis king even though I was winning the war by myself for the most part. I decided to just run with it. There are at least 50 living Lannisters the prestige is up to 5000 now with all the titles my family now has the AI was smart at revoking titles from powerful Vassals for once and since I made the AI land its second sons all of the Seven Kingdoms save for the Iron Isles have two Lannister high lordships. I rebuilt Harrenhal using the console mostly because why not I already gave it the lord of the trident managing the Inheritance was the  roughest part and I have the Westerlands and the Iron Throne about to merge and they hold two duchies a piece I'm hoping I have enough sons to divide it all up,The only bad thing is I didn't wipe out the blood lines for each kingdom or marry into them so they now all have random adventurer wars with my lords paramount I have enough daughters to get the blood lines into the royal line and I can use the fact we're the same dynasty to breed them into the other branches I wiped out houses grey joy and Tully completely so I can't get those bloodines,My next move is to get the various High lord ships under Lannister control which is fairly easy with plots and AI liking to revoke titles and if they don't I have sketchy cheat menu on so I can justify revoking it for role play Reasons. I'm gonna found a bank for more Income and roleplay reasons. I've been mostly roleplaying this game other than taking the reach that was just for the memes,I think its the way I did it I'm still new to this Reddit thing I've lurked for years but never really posted. But I've been playing this game for almost 24 hours non stop and I've enjoyed every moment I just switched to the iron throne after I was no longer head of my dynasty.,I've always wanted to make a custom house but I'm not good at editing images to make a Coat of Arms I was gonna make the old Andal nobility and have them Invade Westeros for the memes,Never meant to take Westeros just wanted to win the war of the five kings but I just kinda had enough power to decide westerosi politics after I took the reach,Getting the ball rolling in Westeros is about the marriage game intrigue helps a lot with that particular game I've rose from a count to a king in generation on accident it's about kidnapping the right people and having the right friends,Volantis formed the Empire of New Valyria I'm half tempted to invade it and just turn it into a feudal society and convert them all to faith of the Seven maybe try to make it all Andal culture as well for memes make myself an Empress,I'm using Tubbs with the Frankish Alternative portraits,I feel like the realm would just be happy we worship the gods after Stannis shattered everything,I was actually Friends with Mace when I got the loan I'm just not sure how he never got an Army big enough to take me in open battle cause I beat one army and marched to highgarden and that was it war was over Sansa had just shown up.,Yeah since his father was the hound he was technically my subject and the AI gave him to me since I was his liege I once I got them married I pressed his claim and bam Lannister Iron throne,Tyrion has high intrigue just about any trick you can pull with little finger Tyrion can pull too I had to kidnap and execute a couple Arryns and murdered my way into Dorne I'm working on getting the blood lines for each kingdom into my family except for the one for iron Isles and the Trident house Tully's bloodline if they even had one should be extinct,Nice the RNG gods have have favored house Lannister a lot my family has genius or attractive I'm doing a little incest so the lords paramount all have the Tywin blood line Kevan's branch of the family went extinct I was gonna give them the iron isles I'm thinking about making the north find the faith of the seven through some shenanigans or the console just for the fun of it,"That sounds pretty neat. I haven't had a campaign like that in awhile, I'm taking some break from CK 2 after playing it continously for few months, can't wait to jump back into the Mod.","I also roleplay usually, sometimes not without sketchy cheat.

I was originally just gonna let my heir inherit the iron throne the slow way just see if the game fires an event if your king of one of the seven kingdoms and then you become king of Westeros but I got tired of the weird border and annexed myself,It is an over kill but it's always been a goal of mine to control one kingdom with only high lords of my dynasty what's 7 more. With the way the AI plays it's likely to happen without my meddling I'm not worried about inbreeding so much the dynasty is fairly large and yeah they're marrying distant cousins or local nobility I might cheat and convert each branch to its local culture to get more naming variety,Yeah if I was any good at save game editing and Dynasty making I would have given each branch of House Lannister cadet branch but that's a lot of work. I might play wide now since I've been playing tall,Considering how the AI is playing after I switched to my wife they're gonna own most of the high lord ships so even if we ever lost the throne we would still have enough power to dictate policy which was my entire plan as house Lannister,"Littlefinger is an underrated character. But now I'm debating on how to best expand Lannister power I've grown tall but I'm considering growing wide as well might right some wrongs my ancestors did and claim my birth right as the blood of old valyria which I consider to be new valyria and Ghiscar since both were subjects of the dragon lords. I'm gonna justify it as ending the slave trade, reclaiming the lands of the Andals and Rhoynar, and making them find god I really like that last justification. Might also use the fact both Aegon the Conqueror and Daenerys thought of forming empires in the east based on the option in the game",It's pretty easy to do save edits. But the cadet branches I haven't investigated myself.,Editing the dynasty number is easy enough but I would have to modify other files so the game recognizes they're cadet dynasties to mine and that's a hassle,They should probably add the depressed trait based on Preston's reaction to season 8,The Virgin NEETrobin VS The Chad Summerchild,His name says Chad but his traits say Virgin.,DA QUEEN IN DA NORF,I mean he's probably missing the dull trait,Is there a barony in the Reach called Summerfell too?

Chad Summerchild is meant to be a stereotypical GoT fan (at least in early videos) who doesn’t see the flaws in the show that Preston/other characters pick up on, but instead focuses on everything being “awesome” and very surface-level symbolism - basically he’s Preston’s interpretation of people who continue to like and defend the show.

I reckon his Aegon becomes a lowborn without family, while the other Aegon takes his place in the Targaryen family tree. Possibly resulting in a Game Over?

Do they have the same character ID?","No they don't. Just like the ""dead or missing"" Stark children in the ACoK bookmark, they are different characters from the characters you can find on the map, but when those are found the original ones get ""replaced"" in the family tree, while the other ""dead"" ones presumably become lowborn with no family, meaning you can't ever find them again in the game, even though they are technically still there.

I bet the same happens with Aegon, but the mod devs probably have a flag on Aerys and Rhaegar for this bookmark that prevents the Aegon invasion from happening should the Usurper war end with them alive. Aegon himself probably doesn't have it. Either that or it is simply an oversight",I don't think they had the same ID,"I'd say it's an oversight.  The fAegon invasion can happen anytime after the Robert's Rebellion bookmark, but OP has started on a custom start date after the bookmark but before the war has ended.

You also never get great scenes like this:

&#x200B;

>""For your onions and fish, I made you a knight once. For this, I am of a mind to raise you to lord.""

>This? Davos was lost. ""I am content to be your knight, Your Grace. I would not know how to begin being lordly.""

>""Good. To be lordly is to be false. I have learned that lesson hard. Now, kneel. Your king commands.""

>Davos knelt, and Stannis drew his longsword. Lightbringer, Melisandre had named it; the red sword of heroes, drawn from the fires where the seven gods were consumed. The room seemed to grow brighter as the blade slid from its scabbard. The steel had a glow to it; now orange, now yellow, now red. The air shimmered around it, and no jewel had ever sparkled so brilliantly. But when Stannis touched it to Davos's shoulder, it felt no different than any other longsword. ""Ser Davos of House Seaworth,"" the king said, ""are you my true and honest liege man, now and forever?""

>""I am, Your Grace.""

>""And do you swear to serve me loyally all your days, to give me honest counsel and swift obedience, to defend my rights and my realm against all foes in battles great and small, to protect my people and punish my enemies?""

>""I do, Your Grace.""

>""Then rise again, Davos Seaworth, and rise as Lord of the Rainwood, Admiral of the Narrow Sea, and Hand of the King.""

>For a moment Davos was too stunned to move. I woke this morning in his dungeon. ""Your Grace, you cannot . . . I am no fit man to be a King's Hand.""

>""There is no man fitter."" Stannis sheathed Lightbringer, gave Davos his hand, and pulled him to his feet.

>""I am lowborn,"" Davos reminded him. ""An upjumped smuggler. Your lords will never obey me.""

>""Then we will make new lords.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Plus he's got hype comments about him. A lot players acknowledges how truly dangerous he is:

&#x200B;

>Tywin Lannister: ""Did you turn into an utter fool when Tyrion shaved your beard? This is Stannis Baratheon. The man will fight to the bitter end and then some.""

&#x200B;

>Varys: ""His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man.""

&#x200B;

>Asha Greyjoy: His eyes were sunk in deep pits, his close-cropped beard no more than a shadow across his hollow cheeks and bony jawbone. Yet there was power in his stare, an iron ferocity that told Asha this man would never, ever turn back from his course.

But sometimes the other available matches are poor due to traits or age. I figured with the Freys, since there are so many, some of the “lesser” or younger children would be stuck marrying bastards or lower-class people if there aren’t enough appropriate matches. 

I’m an extreme novice at this game though so maybe I’m not even phrasing the question correctly, lol.","Not necessarily. Women are considered matured and marriagable when they have their first menstrual cycle. The fact that GRRM makes a point with some characters of having them wait until they're older, suggests most people in this world don't. It's not unreasonable that Rhaella would have had a child at 13. It could have been a lot worse.","No, you are totally fine, I just meant there are multiple things someone would consider a good match in-game - whereas someone coming from just the show and no CK background is likely looking for those prestige matches only. (Like the one Walder got with Edmure.)

There are plenty of quality families with quality traited children to choose from -- and remember, most of Walder's line doesn't need much of a match, anyway, as they won't be anywhere near the rulership of the Twins, or anywhere else, for that matter. :)

From a game perspective, if you played as Walder, you are essentially just looking to get your blood into as many quality families as you can, and the mod creators did an amazing job of adding tons of families in the game, so you'll be fine in that regard.  It is just if you try to marry every kid to a Baratheon/Stark/Tyrell/Lannister/Greyjoy that you'll have trouble.  After all, pretty much every one of these lines is in immediate danger of extinction during the events of the series, so it makes sense.  

Use your in-game search, and I wouldn't worry about the loss of in-game prestige points in almost every instance, especially if the match is getting a great congenital trait like Genius flowing in your bloodline, or if you are securing land or potential lands with them.  

The game does a good job of letting you think critically, so just do what you think best in a Walder playthrough.",">Women are considered matured and marriagable when they have their first menstrual cycle.

Aerys and Rhaella were married when children to try and fulfil prophecy.  13 is still exceptionally young by even Westeros' standards. Go check the wiki out most births are to parents at similar ages to irl maybe a generation ago, between the ages of 19-30.

Dealing with the Wall is kinda easy, they end up dying for attrition and you outnumber them and can pay mercenaries. But when you take the Wall then the King of the Iron Throne attacks you in order to restore the Night Watch, which is (at least for me) a war impossible to win, as he has a lot of troops and the zone of the Wall doesn't have the attrition that the zone beyond the wall has. So I lost it and Jon Snow became commander. Nearly two decades after that I attempt it again, I win kinda easily again and I wait. The Iron Throne is fighting in Essos and the Lannister that rules the North is in a civil war, so I declare war to invade the North. It was very difficult at first, because they sieged the Wall constantly and while you can siege the Gifts very easy the provinces with the Wall are a pain in the ass. Eventually tho the royal troops marches southwars and I could take all the regions of the former Night Watch while a little army invaded Skagos. After that I marched southwards and eventually sieges Winterfell, enslaving its lord and his family. I sold his woman and his only child and heir to slavery (even though its illegal in the Kingdom Beyond-the-Wall), and to the former Lord Paramount of the North I humiliated him, I declaimed bad poetry to him, I mutilated him (taking away a leg, an eye, a hand and disfiguring him, making him lunatic and stressed too), I castrated him, I blinded him and finally I threw him in the obliuette (I disactivate the ""release after torture"" game rule always). And then I enable cheats with the cheats mod to take all the lands of the North that I didnt siege and granting all the duchies of the North to fellow wildlings.

Theon killed Bran and Rick and Robb had died from cancer, leaving the North without any heir and it fell into CW. Looks like Robb won the independence though as Joff and Jaime were beheaded by him.

edit: For anyone coming back here later once this is archived wondering the same thing, I found the answer. So I just wanna update this comment and let y'all know:

You might need the [More Bookmarks](https://citadel.prophpbb.com/topic9926.html) sub-mod for AGOT. The current version of v3.3 works with CK2 v2.7.1 and it says AGOT v1.4.1 but I'm using it with AGOT v1.5 just fine. I will note though that it's important that your CK2 is version 2.7.1, just 2.7 isn't good enough the interface will be messed up and if it's more updated then you'll probably get a bunch of crashes. It's very stable on 2.7.1 though.

You'll go into a custom game start in the scenario and ""The Year of the False Spring (280AL)"" is the one you want, which is 8280. It's important to note that your wife is probably going to be one of the options and she needs to be an adult. If you wanted to edit in a baby Daenerys and marry her or something you'd have to age her up to be able to name her as the Queen of Love and Beauty. Starting in 8280 might break Robert's Rebellion from ever happening though and the Tower of Joy thing will likely never occur either.

There's also no guarantee that you're going to even pass the initial round of the Tourney because your default traits just quite frankly aren't good enough for the winning conditions. I'd suggest using console to do add_trait brilliant_strategist, add_trait strong, add_trait genius, add_trait valyrian_armour, add_trait master_warrior, add_trait brave, add_trait duelist, add_trait hunter, add_trait strategist. That should be enough to win hands down. If you really want you could add add_trait tall (which is the Giant trait like The Mountain has). It isn't based on your Marshall score, it's based on the traits that you have.

Your choices for who to choose are generally your adult wife, and 3 random courtiers. You'd think Lyanna should be hardcoded as a choice but that doesn't seem to be the case. Whoever you choose you have an option to flirt with them and make them a lover and they get an opinion boost of you for naming them the Queen of Love and Beauty.

It's also worth noting that Lyanna probably has a hidden child modifier giving her like -9000 fertility which is removed after the Tower of Joy sequence. And if you play during Robert's Rebellion you're gonna want to win before Fall of 8284 if you want her & the baby to live. 

If Queen Rhaella gets pregnant from Aerys and a baby is born in 8284 it's hardcoded to be Daenerys, though in my experience you have to be playing as Aerys for that to happen and it doesn't use her traits or her DNA. You'll need to save your game uncompressed by unchecking the box to the right of the name of the save and then editing it with something like Notepad++ to transfer over adult Daenerys's stuff if you want to do that. You could also edit the files so she's just born already when you start your game.

There's lots of problems with these scenarios like Lyanna being married to Robert rather than betrothed, Ellaria Sand not being a Lover to Oberyn who is a Lord rather than a Prince, the Stark babies other than Robb are never born, and a lot of characters don't automatically marry their cannon spouses or have their cannon children if they don't already have them when you start the scenario's date.",What game is this? ,"A good man would have resisted, if not for himself or his wife, then for his children",B... but that's not what annulment is...,Thank you for this! ,You are on /r/CK2GameOfthrones you dickhead.,Crusader Kings 2 with the A Game of Thrones mod,"And if not for his children, for the realm","If not for the realm, for his wife's honour.","If not for his wife, then his children","Not for honour, but for YOUUUUUUUUUUUUU!",And if not for the children maybe the realm,I'M STILL IN A DREAM SNAKE EAAAAAATTTEEEEER,"If not for the realm, then for his wife's honour.",IN MY TIME THERE'LL BE NO ONE ELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSE,"FOR THE LIFE OF HIS KIDS,WIFE,FATHE- Eh screw him, BROTHER SISTER- for everyone ok?",CRIIIIIIIIIME!!!

Enjoy the idiocy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw2QDOzdkO8","I like Bronn, too.  Which is why it is even worse what Dickhead and Dickhead did to him.

Think about it.  If they were just going to break the rules of the Watch for Samwell, don't you think he should be LP of the Reach?  

Characters are greater when you don't assign completely out of character things to them... don't forget, in the show's idiocy, Jaime promised LP of the Reach to Sam's father for his help against Highgarden.  Since we are apparently just releasing everyone from their vows, and not only that, appointing Grand Maesters who aren't even graduated Maesters yet, don't you think maybe we could have gotten Sam's birthright to him?

Sam is honestly the worst ending.  Says essentially nothing to stand up for his best friend, doesn't nominate him as the TRUE KING for killing the woman who killed millions by fire, including his own father and brother, all because freaking Yara is on the rag?  

Stupid ending is stupid and I, for one, am glad that the devs of this mod have played the show almost zero service, except in a few small Easter Eggs.",how tf did they come up with this garbage? Sticking with the books,A master of war???? I mean the closest thing to that is the Lords Paramount and the Commander of the Kingsguard but seriously what??????,I hear ya on that. Sam should have had it. He got dun dirty.,"u/Corrin_Toast essentially got right to the heart of it.  Not only with subverting expectations, but they did FAR too much fan service.  

We all know where Bronn ends in the books -- but for the show, due to illness striking down the actor who played Ser Ilyn Payne, they had Bronn do Jaime Lannister's training after losing his hand, accompanies him to Dorne, etc.

Jon and Dany go to parley with Cersei at the Dragonpit, and they brought a wight that they captured beyond the Wall to show Cersei that the Walker threat is real.  

Bronn trains Jaime, did everything he ever did for Tyrion, did everything he ever did for Cersei, and no one is paying off his castle.  Finally, Cersei (offscreen, of course, Lena Headey and Jerome Flynn had it in their contracts that they would never appear together because they used to fuck in real life...) sends Bronn after both Jaime and Tyrion (Jaime splits to go fight for the living against the Walkers.)

They defeat the Walkers, and Jaime and Tyrion are talking about how Jaime fucked Brienne, alone in a tavern like spot... Bronn walks in with Joffrey's crossbow and says Cersei offered him Riverrun to take them out.  He socks Tyrion and Tyrion reminds him of the whole ""if someone pays you to kill me, I'll double it..."" and Bronn asks...

""What is double Riverrun?""

Highgarden.

So, even though Bran has never even met Bronn by the end of the season, he is made Lord Paramount of the Reach AND they make the man who literally doesn't understand loaning money the Master of Coin.

-----

Why did they do this?  Because Jerome Flynn's Q-Rating as Bronn was off the charts.  Everyone loved Bronn, so they got more Bronn.

What makes the entire ending truly pathetic is that this isn't even close to the dumbest thing they did.  Not. Even. Close.

(Sorry to anyone who hadn't seen the ending yet, but it has been six months, and this was vital to discussion.  You can downvote me if you wish, I understand.)","Gotta ""Subvert the audience's expectations"" as they said.

They were more preoccupied with doing something that would surprise the viewers of the show than something that's actually good and that makes sense","It's show only invention of Cersei, which were retained by Daenerys and Bran. Honestly this position makes sense - crippled king could not properly lead armies, so delegate this to martially capable person is logical choice.

[https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Master\_of\_War](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Master_of_War)","Totally, considering they never once have him stick up for Jon Snow.

Not only that, but they never show you Gilly again, either... Sam's just Grand Maester and he's just peachy with everything that occurred. 

The entire ending is just so stupid that I truly hope George Martin is deathly embarrassed.  He literally intended the work to be so epic that it COULDN'T be adapted, then he lets two idiots adapt it that couldn't find a good story if it hit them in the face.

And the annoying thing is I know she's probably going to end up doing the same in the books, so there's more than likely a plotline that isn't completely nonsensical GRRM has planned, probably to do with fAegon.","Honestly, any ending with Bran as King where it isn't shown that he is a complete pawn of the Children of the Forest rings false, as long as the show goes.

He has these powers, right?  

Why did he tell Jon his parentage?  All it did was fuck everything up.

He knew Dany would burn Kings Landing -- did nothing.

Knew Euron was waiting to kill Rhaegal -- did nothing.

But the dumbest?  It's a tie between Euron washing up on the exact same beach as Jaime...losing the fight, and breaking the fourth wall to say ""I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister..."" --- and ""The new King just gave up his ancestral seat, so he has absolutely zero loyal force, and his sister would overrun the Iron Throne, and Sansa would be Queen of the Seven Kingdoms in short order.""

Not only does he give up his ancestral seat, but he gives the ENTIRE NORTH AWAY?  And Dorne and the Iron Islands say sweet fuck all?  It all just rings so false, but those are probably the two dumbest...

Bran's reign would be crazy short as he has no loyal forces, and why in the world would someone so tied to the North rule the South?  Why can't he instantly locate Drogon?  Why couldn't he just tell Arya what is west of Westeros?

Honestly, I could probably write for several days on it.  The fact that Bran is not shown to be the pawn of the Children, and essentially evil, killed it.  He's getting his revenge for the Children, it is VERY obvious...","See, you essentially got into the show right as the book content ended, for the most part.  Jon Snow is currently dead, as far as the books.  His last word was ""Ghost"" and most of us assume that warging into Ghost is how he will survive, but who knows if we will find out.  

I mean, I won't say it isn't worth watching, but you can feel the drop in quality once GRRM's written content was done.","100%

I’m sorta upset that *this* was how that was presented to the world. Dany going from the beggar king’s controlled and berated sister to Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains to The Mad Queen who burned down King’s Landing is a remarkable transformation that is tied up with lineage, honor, her perceived birthright, and the limits of one’s mental ability to cope. In the books, something is going to happen to make her lose it and that’ll probably be Aegon taking the throne and bringing some sort of peace to his part of Westeros before Dany even arrives on the shore. All she did was for nothing and that, with an appropriate amount of stress and perhaps at the end of a brutal military campaign, is enough to make her burn down the city.

Wish we got that well written in a book first, but oh well, it’s at least slightly contenting to know how everything’s roughly going to go.","I had to add...

The story essentially starts with a King who doesn't give a shit about ruling as King of Westeros... and it ends with a King who doesn't give a shit about ruling as King of Westeros.

You see it at the Small Council.  He wants a Master of War, Whisperers, and Laws, so he can ""look for Drogon"" and then completely absent himself.

He's Robert without the wine.  What kind of ending is that?","I have no idea what you’re on about with this ‘pawn of the Children’ thing, but I just want to say that Euron didn’t break the fourth wall. He said something aloud to himself, he didn’t direct it at the audience.","Yeah I kings noticed that. After season 5, it was a change in writing and story all together, when I binged 1-4 2 weeks before 5 came out","We can agree to disagree on the fourth wall.

As far as Pawn of the Children, the only way the King Bran tale actually works with what happened is if he is evil.  Who helped him at Bloodraven's cave?  The Children.  Why?  Because he was all that mattered.

Why?  Name one thing Bran does that is actually GOOD for anyone living.

He could see the past, present, and future.

He says ""Tell Jon the truth."" Why?  All it did was cause the deaths of the citizens of Kings Landing.  Bran knows Jon is never to be King, so why tell him, except to foment the dissent between Jon and Dany so she scours KL.

He sees Euron's position...doesn't warn Dany, even though it costs her Rhaegal (which he also sees...) and her bestie in Missandei.  

Is Bran being King actually good for Westeros?  The story starts with a drunk who doesn't care about ruling, and ends with a cripple who doesn't care about ruling -- AND it also splits in into six and one AND leaves Westeros with a King without a ancestral seat.(and thus any troops.)

Literally the only people that ending is good for are the Small Council members (no one of real value to the Kingdoms, mind you) and Sansa.  Everyone else's end is awful.

Who benefits from the fact that Westeros just got massively screwed, and that Bran could have stopped the Scouring of KL at any time?  

Those who wanted revenge -- the Children of the Forest.  The same people who were surrounding and working for the last Raven, and gave the lives there for Bran at the Cave.  Why?  What benefit is any of that to the Children?

They want their revenge, that's what... and what better way than to destroy a million humans, split their Kingdoms, and ruin royal succession by putting their leader (the Raven) on the Throne.

When you actually analyze the way the ending goes down, it isn't a good ending for anyone really...except for those that wanted revenge.  

For the ending to work, Bran is evil and likely working alongside/for The Children.","R5: I console'd a dragon onto Robb Stark to help him win the war against Joff before I went to screw around in Sothoryos for a while.

Waiting for KL to fall because it takes kinda long but instead got killed by my own father.,I think my shortest was playing as Aegon of Essos. Got sick and died 6 weeks after the game start date lol.,"Are there any good tutorials for this game/mod?  I've been playing it for years but I can only get in maybe a few hours every few months or so, and I didn't even know you could bring up a family tree like that!  I played through the game's tutorial mode but that really only gives you the bare bones basics.","I started at the same time and essentially the same thing happened, but I was just lucky enough to not be in KL at the time. I think both Stannis and Robert ended up dying in the explosion.","The Tourney of Harrenhal happened like a year before the War of the Usurper, right? And Aerys made Jaime stay in KL and guard Rhaella and Viserys. So Jaime would've been knighted after the conflict with the Kingswood Brotherhood, meaning he was in the Kingsguard for at least two years before the War of the Usurper.

It probably means that Jaime was there, but he was guarding Rhaella or somebody that day. I had Varys kill the pyromancer and Aerys once. THAT was interesting.","Jaime joined the Kingsguard when he was 15 (281 AC) and Robert's Rebellion started at the end of 282 AC, so he was in the Kingsguard at this point as I started early 282 AC but the event must not have triggered because it was technically Mace Tyrell's rebellion, not Roberts",I started as a count once and got my only title revoked by my king 2 days after game start.,Tubb's better portrait mod :),"Kings landing turn into a ruin that you can colonize and if robert dies before the war is over and the rebels win, it will have a great council to decide a new king.","I’d recommend playing some vanilla first. Try playing as a count in Ireland where you’re pretty secluded from the larger world.

It’s much easier to learn the basics in the regular game than it is in the mod. Once you’re comfortable with the gameplay, it’s not bad getting adjusted to the mod.

That’s how it worked for me, but I’m the type of person that learns by doing. I’m sure there are videos and stuff online if you would benefit more from watching someone walk you through stuff first.",Wasn't Jaime chose to be Kingsguard *during* the Tourney and then immediately sent to King's Landing?,That time Mace Tyrell did something lol.,Oof.,"Normally that's exactly how I do it and most games I can figure just about everything out in a couple of hours, but with this game I am constantly seeing screenshots of menus or screens I didn't even know existed!  There are so many damn buttons and things that seem like there should be a really obvious way to get to them, but they're kind of hidden away in submenus and stuff.","No, not the Tourney of Harrenhal. Aerys specifically ordered Jaime to stay behind and guard Rhaella and Viserys because Tywin had resigned as Hand and he was twitchy that Jaime being there (amongst rumors of supposed plotters) would be dangerous. 

That's why when the mysterious Knight of the Laughing Tree appears during the Tourney of Harrenhal, Aerys believes the knight is Jaime in disguise, and orders Rhaegar to arrest this unknown Knight of the Laughing Tree. But of course we essentially figure this is Lyanna Stark, based on the Reeds' story to Bran.",Its happened a few times. Its somewhat expected in 3000+ hours of gameplay but it really pissed me off the first time it happened. And the second. Third. Basically it pisses me off every time I go for the White Hun Achievement.,"Yea, it’s a dense game. I honestly feel like I’m constantly finding new stuff despite having a ton of time logged and I would also note that I forget about a lot of things that I don’t use too often only to rediscover them later.

There’s a wiki for ck2 that may be useful for you. Other than that, I don’t have specific tutorial recommendations. You may benefit from just clicking around a lot to try to explore every menu and screen.","Changelog Version 1.4.1

I have followed all the steps from the manual and tried the various changes to path, putting # before user_dir, and deleted the loading screens folder from Steve Moran's page (http://stevenmoran.com/2012/06/how-to-get-a-game-of-thrones-mod-for-crusader-kings-ii-working-on-your-mac/) but it still doesn’t work.

I am able to start the game and I am able to select both the mods that I would like to use (I can choose both AGOT and Century of Blood).
I can then choose which era I would like and choose which character to start with – this takes me to the rules page, but when I choose Start Game, the mod initialises, the game loads and then crashes back to desktop.
So close and so frustrating, can anyone help me? I bought the game solely for this mod.

EDIT: Not just the submod, the normal game too.","For some reason whenever I start my events (like I have started several times over now), none of the typical events are firing. I thought at first it was just because these people weren't offering, but after several attempts at new saves-- I simply don't get the options.

Poor dude.","I was playing as Robert & Lyanna's son, Steffon ""Darkstorm"" (no clue how he got that name)

On the way to a tourney I think, I found this riverlands kid named Kermit & decided to take him as a squire. He grew into a pretty good knight, got him married (to a Lannister I believe), & eventually raised him to nobility, making him Kermit of House Blandish. Steffon eventually died, & his son Selwyn became king. Kermit was made an advisor on the small council & had a daughter before dying of stress. Selwyn became the child's guardian, & vowed that House Blandish would be rewarded with land. He began a conquest of the Stepstones, granting the girl one of the islands, & eventually she or her son will be given the title of Lord Paramount.

Also a Lord Commander of my Kingsguard, Paul ""the Hunter"", a lowborn knight, had an affair with my mother so I removed him from the Kingsguard.

Unfortunately, he also took the Valyrian steel sword I'd made for the Kingsguard (Loyalty) & the Blackfish's armor (who also joined the Kingsguard)","I've had CK2 for years (only because I wanted to play this mod) but never gotten into it.

I few weeks back I tried it again and finally it clicked somehow and I've been dying to tell somebody about my first adventure.

So I played Bobby B in the Crowned Stag scenario since that sounded nice and easy for a beginner.

Firstly, Ned Stark and Tywin both die within the first year or so. I want to plot to kill Cersei but it backfires, everybody hates Robert. So I just imprison and behead her without any good reason. Robert's now a tyrant.

I plan to kidnap Dany and it works. I realize I can force marry prisoners, Robert is now married to Dany (who's like 8 or something).

Robert gets poisoned pretty much right away. Stannis takes over and is already married with 3 children. I manage to marry his oldest to Dany shortly before Stannis dies of severe stress.

Then Tristan Baratheon and Dany live and rule happily for 46 years, have lots of children. Then the Great Sickness strikes King's Landing, most of the children die, Dany dies, Tristan dies. His son takes over and rules for like a month before he also dies.

In the end I was only left with a sister of Tristan who had been living in Braavos and was a follower of the Many Faced God and also cruel. People hated her and there were so many hostile factions it was insane.

I had her convert to the Faith of the Seven but it was too late. She was assassinated and then her little son took over for a few months before also being killed when literally every kingdom joined a war to depose him.

Sooo nothing special, but I'm just excited that I finally played a whole game and had fun with it.","I made literal dwarfs. I thought the norvoshi with their forked beards look rather dwarvish so I made my starting character norvoshi in ethnicity but I started in the westerlands. I wanted a place where I could eventually start a gold mine but where one wasn’t already established. (I can’t remember where it was, but i found the perfect place).

Obviously my character was a literal dwarf. And I also made him greedy, strong, a drunkard, diligent, and an administrator. I also gave him a high stewardship education (and yes I kind of cheated with his age, but I dislike how you can’t add any traits without making them old). 

Anyway, it was a lot of fun and the game ended when I felt too powerful as I was in a position to take over all the westerlands and it didn’t really feel right for that house, so I decided to retire them. 

It was one of the most fun houses I’ve had though. I didn’t want to take over the world. Just get mega rich and gain a lot of artifacts and treasures.","I started as Rodrik Forrester, and took over Wolfswood. Stannis lost as he always does, so I focused on bringing down Boltons from the inside. The opportunity came soon, since Boltons were so hated, to put fake Arya - Jeyne Poole - on the throne of Winterfell, which I did. The problem was, however, that she was married to Ramsey, and all of her kids were of Bolton dynasty.  
I served her faithfully until she died of old age, helping her establish an indepedent Kingdom of the North, and when she died, I overthrew moanrchy and created the North Republic.","In my latest Jon AFFC playthrough, I married him to Val, got an attractive son from her, console commanded all of Jon's black brothers friends in his court (removing their nightswatch trait) as well as Asha and Theon, and Mance Rayder and his son. Sansa and her husband Littlefinger joined my court and Rickon was luckily found alive.

Everything was set up for a wholesome playthrough in which Jon rule the North surrounded by all his friends. Until the White Walkers kicked in and slaughtered every single person in my court by sieging Winterfell. Including Samwell Tarly, Mance Rayder and his son, Grenn, Pip, Gilly, Rickon, Jon's wife, Jon's son.

At the cost of everything he was willing to fight for, Jon ultimately managed to beat the White Walkers and take the Iron Throne from Stannis, in retaliation for his lack of help in the Long Night. Only to be betrayed by the surviving Littlefinger, Sansa Stark, and their loads of genius sons.

Eventually after all that Bran showed up after being missing for decades, and y'know. Who had a better story than him amirite?","I was playing Robb Stark.

Roslin Frey died before giving me a child, and I put off marrying again until the war was done.  When I was secure in my kingdom, I decided I should marry a Northern woman.  And who was one of the most eligible women in the North at this time?  Lyanna Mormont.  Hell yeah, I said.

Robb and Lyanna had the event to fall in love almost immediately, and the next few decades were fantastic.  She gave me three sons in a row, Eddard, Brandon, and Benjen.  Eddard was strong, and all of them grew up with great skills.  The economy was going great.  The South was tearing itself to pieces, the North was secure, and my family was happy.

After my first three boys she gave me three girls; Sansa, Lyarra, and Catelyn.  Then a fourth boy, Rickard.

And then our eighth child.  Little Maege Stark.

We knew from the start that there was something off about Maege.  She didn't cry like other children, and the direwolves shied away from her.  She didn't fit into the family like the other children.  A few years passed, and my boys were beset with terrible nightmares.

And then they all began to die, one by one.  They disappeared, they died in accidents, they woke up screaming and seemed to die from fright.  One by one, all seven of my older children died, until all that was left was little Maege and her devious smile.

My dear wife died of an illness not long after Maege came of age, and beset with depression, I took my own life.

Long live Maege Stark, Queen in the North.","I played as Renly and chose to support Stannis's claim during the War of the Five (now Four) Kings. The moment we won, Margaery killed Stannis without my involvement and the throne passed to me.  Margaery got caught so I gave her a trial by combat and chose Boros Blount; Margaery obviously chose Garlan who killed Boros, making my wife ""innocent"" and opening a spot for Loras in the Kingsguard. She bore me many strong and handsome sons, a few of which were even mine. 10/10 would marry into the Tyrells again","Have you heard the story of Lord Cregan Stark, the Immortal, Dragon Riding, Eunuch with 12 kids? It is not a story told outside the North. Lord Cregan was a Queensman through and through but the perils of mortality troubles him. After summoning his council his master of laws introduced him to a woman from the summer isles, who after several trials, provided Lord Cregan with a potion that would either kill or provide immortality. The latter saw through and Lord Cregan was immortalized. Later he would find a dragon egg in the crypts of winterfell and after a tour of the 7 kingdoms, volantis and the smoking sea, Lord Cregan hatched a dragon who breathed white flame and named it Icebreaker. Unfortunately the game started crashing before his story could be finished but it was awesome.","I started out as Rhaegar during  Robert's Rebellion. Immediately started a plot to kidnap Aerys and it gets overwhelming support. The plot succeeds within a year and I manage to force him to abdicate. I then corner Bobby B in the Riverlands and and end the war by capturing him in battle, although Gerold Hightower dies during this battle.

After the war is over I pardon Ned Stark and Jon Arryn, letting them bend the knee, but send a still living Robert to the wall, giving the Stormlands to Stannis.

Tower of Joy event occurs and thankfully both Lyanna and the baby survive, I take her back to Kings landing as my mistress and make Jon a true Targ, using the consol command to change his name to Jahaerys.

I betroth my son Aegon to Margaery Tyrell and Rhaenys to Tyrion Lannister. Tyrion eventually becomes my master of coin and their children are all brilliant. Despite him being a dwarf and Rhaenys hating me for betrothing her to him, they manage to actually fall in love and have a good marriage.

I squire both Aegon and Jahaerys to Arthur Dayne and Barristan Selmy respectively, they both grow up to to be great fighters. Marry Jahaerys to Danaerys (because of course right?) and give them Summerhall as a seat.

I end up having three more children with Lyanna, one of which is a girl named Aemma who joins the Kingsguard (she was fostered by Oberyn, so there's that going for her). But all in all, I was trying to play this run as a sort of stability run, rebuild the kingdoms and fight as few wars as possible, and rebuild all the relationships that Bobby B's rebellion destroyed. A good run.","TL;Dr:  Trojan War but with the Wildling King.

I had a great end to a game that began to crash.  I had a high stat Targaryen heir Maekar Targaryen from Rhaegar's line (RR bookmark) who the AI made a Master Seducer.  Wanting to make sure he only made bastards with good genes I played him as High Lord of Tyrosh, the new heir's seat replacing Dragonstone.

There was a King Beyond the Wall at this time and to build up martial I had my Targaryen heir return from a brothel run through Yi-Ti to attack the Wildlings.  I took their capital and captured the Wildling King's young wife. I had him rape her since her stats were good and I wanted to humiliate the Wildling leader.

Welp, he captures the Night Watch LC and gains the wall.  Then the event triggers that awakens the giants and creates 40,000 to 60,000 event spawned Wildlings pouring into the North.

My Tyrosh army gets reduced to 600 men and the Wildling are tearing the North as far as besieging Winterfell and the Dreadfort.  I thought I may lose since most big vassals were busy with tyranny wars or didn't join to help. Soon my heir inherits the Iron Throne and thankfully I didn't ban the Faith Militant yet.  Joining with an army of fanatics we chip at their numbers.

Eventually my new King Maekar confronts the King Beyond the Wall in a duel.  I kill the Wildling and the invasion immediately ends. His wife was kept in the dungeons as a sex slave and her two bastard daughters were raises Faith of Seven for the final insult.","I got one. Queen Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen did not go to Slaver's bay but rather sailed to Pentos and married Aegon. They had 2 sons (Aegon the Younger and Aemon) and three daughters (Visenya, Rhaenys, Aelinor). Rob had captured Joffery and beheaded him and Jamie before handing the crown to Stannis. Stannis and the other territories of the Realm gave one hell of a fight before surrendering to Daenerys. Of them, only Stannis met his untimely end. He had lost and his daughter and wife aere captives. So the man had fled to Volantis leaving them to their fate. Daeny killed the wife and released Shireen. The Lord Paramounts aere happy enough. Stannis returned years later with a red priest of R'hollr and tried to convert the Dragon Queen. They both were killed outright and fed to Drogon. Later Aegon the Elder, left to conquer Essos after leaving a 41 to Dawnys pregnant with Aelinor. In her time Daenerys ruled for 50 years to the day and was famed and beloved. And feared, but mostly the first two. Oh and the Srarks turned into blood thirsty monsters.","Eh I was playing as Jorah Mallister, the Lord of Seagard during the Dance of Dragons. Eventually I was able to marry my firstborn daughter to a dragon-rider Targaryen and gain extremely good marriages for the rest of them (I had only daughters, but it worked out this time). So I decided it was time to kill myself since my grandson was a genius with Targaryen bloodline. So I decided to go out in style. 

I, Jorah Mallister Hand of the King will die trying to mount Goldenfyre. So I click, and I’m successful. I was kind of stunned at this point. Goldenfyre might have the most trainable traits in the game, but the natural chance of taking a dragon is like 1/400. At this point I’m jokingly thinking about if the Greyjoys try that “raiding” thing again. So then the Iron Bank calls and tells me that Cregan Stark didn’t pay his debts. So naturally I rally the banners of Seagard, and with 2 dragon riders (myself and my son in law) we smash the Northern armies and seize Winterfell. That was how a Mallister became Lord Paramount of the North. 

Anyways, Rhaenyra (the fool) lost the throne in a tyranny war after the Dance and a Lord Protector was put into place. Being a dragonrider with 20 stewardship and 19 marshal I was elected to the position. Then I took the quest to locate a Valyrian Steel Sword for my house, which I promptly named Lord Valorous. This was how House Mallister truly became “Above the Rest”. 

Now something to mention. Within a generation of Jorah’s death the plague hit Westeros and in this plague many notable houses went extinct, most notably houses Velaryon, Reyne, Tarbeck, and Tyrell. It also killed off half of House Targaryen and made my (then) husband the owner of Dark Sister. Then when my character and him died the genius character I mentioned earlier inherited several dragon eggs, and both Dark Sister and Lord Valorous. Downright ridiculous run for within 3 generations.

House Mallister - “Above the Rest”","This was a few years ago by now, so I don't quite remember all the details. I started as the Mad King during Robert's Rebellion. There was some kind of bug that made the rebellion insta-fail, but Robert soon declared war for the throne based on his own claim anyway. Aerys himself was quickly killed in battle by Denly Thorne (brother of the infamous ser Alliser) and Rhaegar claimed the throne. We were losing on all sides, so I made a desperation move and try to lay siege to Storm's End. Somehow, it worked. Robert and his armies were heading for me. Rheagar fought not one, but two warriors before he stood face to face with Robert himself. Suffering a terrible wound during the battle, Rhaegar managed to kill his opponent and end the war.   


Illness had claimed Elia Martell during the war, and so Rhaegar remarried to Lyanna. Unfortunately, Rhaegar's wounds took a turn for the worse after the war ended. His young son, Aegon VI, took the throne. Shortly after Rhaegar's death, Lyanna gave birth to a child, a boy she named Rhaegar. Aegon served as king for almost sixty years, appointing his half-brother Rhaegar as Lord of the Vale following an uprising from the Arryns. He had five children who survived to old age; Baelor the Mad, Daenerys, Daemon, and two others whose names escape me. The eldest, Baelor, was deemed unfit for the throne by his father and was forced to take the black. Somewhen in his late sixties or seventies, Aegon is poisoned. The assailant is unknown, and Daemon takes the throne.  


Daemon's reign is a chaotic one, as his younger siblings vie for the throne as well. Meanwhile, in the far north, Baelor has defected from the Watch and gone to join the wildlings. He is married to a Queen Beyond the Wall who leads several unsuccessful raids on the Watch. The game ended with Daemon's daughter, Syaella, becoming Princess of Dorne and soon being ousted in favor of a local noble. The Targaryens still reigned in the north, but it was her uncle and aunt who sat on the Iron Throne, rather than herself.","In one of my AFFC start playthroughs, Mance Rayder’s son Owen became a formidable fighter and a Knight after being raised at Storm’s End after Dany let Stannis bend the knee and retain the stormlands. He was appointed the King’s Guard at 15, rose to Lord Commander by 25. He later was discovered to have been carrying on an affair with Missendei, was sent to the wall. At the wall, Owen deserted and became King Beyond the Wall, as his father had been. It took him until the age of 39 but he conquered the Night’s Watch and killed Jon Snow in single combat.","Played as Torrhen Stark in Aegons Conquest Bookmark, with the goal of slowly building up the North into an impenetrable fortress able to defend itself against the entirety of the South.  


\-Got a super good Castellan and upgraded the 3 towers of Moat Cailin into larger castle levels and built a fourth castle in the empty holding slot, renaming them to Southwall, Eastwall, Westwall and Northwall as if the four holdings are the defenses pointing each direction of the rebuilt fortress.  
\-Built up Winterfell's demense for as much income as possible  
\-Turned Sea Dragon Point into a western version of White Harbour and granted it to the line of Torrhen's half brother, Brandon Snow, whose descendants became House Seastark.  
\-Wiped out the Boltons and replaced them with another Cadet House, Darkstark. Also started House Redstark in a Barony in one of the Winterfell dutchy's counties.  
\-Started the Bank of Winterfell to increase profits for the North  
\-Managed to gain independence while a civil war was going on in the Iron Throne  
\-Repelled at least 1 attempt to reconquer the North every 10 or so years(whatever length truce's last after a war) for nearly a century, including one Stark slaying a Dragon at White Harbour, and an uncountable number of battles where I wiped out larger forces at Moat Cailin because of the terrain bonuses the Moat gives as well as having recruited dragon riders through marriage later on. I won wars usually solely through winning battles, as I'd led armies too big to fight run about the north sieging and taking attrition from enemy territory and usually also winter, until they were small enough to smash. My armies would dance around the north to avoid direct battle until they could catch smaller armies and inferior ones. I remember in one of the longer lasting wars I counted up the battle casualties near the end and it was something like 25k losses for me against like 170k losses for my combined enemies. I also built up the navy of the north and used it to sail my army on multiple occasions from white harbour down to the Crownlands, bypassing the riverlands entirely, and sieging down Kings Landing while all my enemies were freezing to death in the North.  


TL;DR: I played the North as the unconquerable monster it's meant to be and bathed in the blood of southerners.","Ah my first game... Eddard became the grand champion of the Seven Kingdoms and then died to a small wound. Robb was killed by Tywin in personal combat, and Bran also died. I was playing as Sansa in the end when Arya returned now married to a Frey. The Iron Throne was taken over by House Brax, everything had the unicorn on it and they also marched to take the North, I was only left with Winterfell. Chaos is truly a ladder","Once my heir decided Join a free Company, not satisfied he gains several lands around essos, joining another Wars, jumping from a city tô another finished ben killed in a single combat in a civil war in Bravos. At this time he was a lord in Bravos marshes.","Rhaelle Naelaros, First of Her Name, Lady-Paramount of the Stepstones and former queen

Born Rhaelle Waters she was one of the many bastards sired by Lady Visenya following the dissolution of the marriage between Aegon and her.

Naturally sharp-witted but shy, she spent most of her time in the libraries of the fledging Red Keep. Mayhaps these books gave her a revelation as she tamed the Balerion and set out to carve a realm in the Stepstones

Through fire and blood the Stepstones were united under Rhaelle and she was crowned a queen in her own right. King Haerys I Targaryen unsurprisingly saw this as a threat

Years of war passed and thousands of men from both sides died in the Stepstones alongside 4 dragons brought down by Rhaelle and Balerion including Vhagar, the dragon rode by her late mother

Eventually captured and imprisoned in the Red Keep, she would retain her life, lands and incomes in exchange of bending the knee, becoming a Lord-Paramount and lifetime in prison

Rhaelle would spend the last years of her life locked in the Red Keep until dying of old age under the reign of Queen Daena I Targaryen","Playing as a merged branch of Stark-Greyjoys called the Greystarks that emerged during the battle of the five kings on the farthest west island of the Iron Isles. After being hidden for years, Brandon Greystark, the founder of the bloodline and descendant of both great houses, amassed an army and won the kingsmoot for the Iron Islands after Balon Greyjoy's death at the hands of his brother, Euron. He married Asha Greyjoy to settle the peace between the houses.

The Greystark house is a merge of the Greyjoys and the Starks, taking elements of both their personalities. Fiercely loyal to their families, they take an element of honor from the Starks. At the same time the Greystarks are ruthless ravagers, taking the religions and traditions from the Greyjoys. 

Brandon, who was around the same age as Robb Stark, desired to press his claim on the North, but respected his relative's titles. After meeting and becoming friends after Brandon raided King's Landing, clearing the way for Robb to seize the capital and kill the Lannisters, Brandon and Robb became good friends. After about twenty years, the Greystark house had become one of the wealthiest in the land, and Brandon had taken several wives from great houses, including Margarey Tyrell, an Aryyn daughter, Daenerys Targaryen (her son ruled in Mareen), a Lannister woman, Shireen Baratheon, and several others. His heart was still with his wife, Asha, however. 

Unfortunately, Robb Stark died an early death, and the North fell into succession wars. At this point, Brandon decided to press his claim, since he was one of the few who was respected enough to rule. After winning the 5-year war, Brandon was king of the Iron Islands, the North, and the Riverlands, naming the kingdom the Iron North. 

Towards the end of his life, Brandon set out on raid after raid, obsessed with finding every great house's Valyrian Steel swords, which was a desire eventually fulfilled by his heir. He reformed his relgion, became a God-King, became a legendary hero of the drowned society, and was followed by his daughter by Daenerys, Rhaella, who herself was known as a great leader. She tamed a dragon and expanded the realm even further. His one true-born heir with Asha died in his mid-20s, but arose from the ocean as a drowned man. He leads Rhaella's armies.","It has been a while since I’ve had a compelling playthrough, so here’s an old one.

I was playing as Renly Baratheon before he got killed. I avoided Stannis' monster thing and won the war against him and Joffery. I then proceeded to have a single son his name was Lyonel Baratheon he had white hair and grew up to be an amazing warrior. In this game, Daenerys died and there was a new owner of Drogon. While reigning as Renly I invited the new owner of Drogon to my court where he stayed. However, Renly died at the age of 56 from gonorrhea his son Lyonel took the throne. At the same time, Drogon killed his owner giving Lyonel a chance to tame the dragon which he did. He took Drogon and concurred all of the free Seven kingdoms he then flew to Pentos, Myr and the rest of Essos and concurred them with most of them surrendering. That is the story of Lyonel Baratheon.",Made my own post a few years ago:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/1oivg4/king\_euron\_greyjoy\_the\_ladies\_man/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/1oivg4/king_euron_greyjoy_the_ladies_man/),"One time I was playing as Princess Visenya, King Maegor's daughter, who grew up to be more like her mother, Queen Ceryse, than her father in personality (to many people's relief, I'm sure). She had a half-sister, Princess Leaysa, daughter of Queen Alys, but she died stillborn. She was granted the seat of Dragon's Den (formerly Dyre Den), and was the Lady of Dragonpoint (formerly Crackclaw Point).

Prince Aegon declared war for his claim and lost, and he and his wife Princess Rhaena were imprisoned and died in King Maegor's dungeons. Their daughter Princess Aerea became the new Lady of Dragonstone, but then she died of suspicious circumstances (and not because of me, I assure you), so her sister Princess Rhaella inherits. Prince Viserys died after being tortured by Maegor, just like canon. The Faith lost, too, and so did all the lords who declared for independence after.

Rhaella and Visenya's remaining cousins didn't like her that much as she's a pretender and claimant to the Iron Throne, and even more so when her father nominated her as the heir, and that no relation should come before her. Prince Jaehaerys was betrothed to Rhaella, but then eloped with Princess Alysanne.

When Visenya was 15, Maegor died of horrific burns. But she wasn't crowned - it was Jaehaerys instead, crowned by his mother, Alyssa, in his new crown, a gold band with seven different-coloured gemstones. Even worse, he imprisoned Ceryse, her mother!

The Iron Islands supported Visenya, and so did the High Septon (surprisingly), and other minor houses. The Reach went neutral, and everyone else supported Jaehaerys. Meanwhile, Balerion flew to Dragon's Den and was tamed by Visenya.

It's hard at first as I had to try and stop Dragonpoint from being stomped, especially as I couldn't use Balerion yet. But after I came of age, it got easier, especially with the Iron Islands and the Faith helping.

Jaehaerys was sent to the Wall. Were it be anyone else he would've been executed, but no man is more accursed than a kinslayer, so. Alysanne was called on trial and found guilty for conspiracy against the realm, and she was sent to the sept to become a Silent Sister. Rhaella had her lordship revoked, and married some random lord.

Visenya was crowned by the High Septon in an extravagant ceremony. She wore the crown of her father, Maegor, and her grandfather, King Aegon the Conqueror. There was unrest during her ascension, and during the early years of her rule she kept the realm together and swayed the lords of the Seven Kingdoms to her side, since they didn't have a high opinion of her father.

Visenya later married the second son of the Triarch of Volantis, and had several children. Queen Dowager Ceryse Hightower would die of the flu a few days after her eldest son, Prince Maegor, was born. Maegor eventually eloped with a peasant from Dragon's Gate, and forfeited his inheritance, passing the throne to his younger brother, the well-liked Prince Aegon. Aegon married his younger sister Princess Ceryse, and Visenya's youngest children Prince Aerion and Princess Viserra married each other too. She would then be friends with her husband, and grew to love him as well. When he died a natural death, she was devastated, and sought solace in the arms of another.

Visenya's reign was long and and peaceful. She died at the age of 65, bedridden and infirm, surrounded by her children and grandchildren. Known as Queen Visenya 'the Just', may she find peace with the Gods.

Thus House Targaryen is descended from the line of King Aegon the Conqueror and Queen Visenya.

Not as epic as all the other stories here, but I really enjoyed this playthrough. Definitely a better story than Bran the Broken.","I was playing as a house customiser'd son of Stannis Baratheon,  and a follower of the Lord of Light

After Stannis won the war of the five kings, I intrigued it up with my buddy Harrold Arryn (because I guess Robin and everyone else died?) and plotted for him to start a revolt. Which worked. It ended up working out for me and before long Stannis was in the Eyrie and I was king. To start my great conversion of Westeros, I revoked Harrenhal from a Frey (got a few tyrant points there) and granted it to Beric Dondarrion of the Brotherhood Without Banners. During this time, Harrold kept trying to ransom me Stannis, who was my heir at the time, to which I responded with 'oh nah you can just keep him'. As my character was burned (thought it'd be a nice trait in the Character customiser, a zealous follower of R'hllor who was once rejected by the red god) I tried to heal my disfigurement many times to no avail. *However* I did manage to convert most lords of the seven kingdoms. For Tyrion, Loras, Harrold and Doran I put them on the council, then used 'Cure Ailments' or 'Cure disfigurements'. I continued my attempts until they healed, after which they became R'hllor zealots. Eventually, I decided to finally pay Stannis' ransom, managed to imprison him for other crimes and then he demanded a trial by combat. He chose himself, so I thought I'd solve the problem on my own.

I dueled Stannis and won. But then he was resurrected. To which I said. 'Oh great. We'll sacrifice you'. I then had the Kinslayer trait and not a lot of friends, but a *lot* of bastards. Eventually, Edric legitimised himself. Which, I'd been wanting to do for a while but couldn't manage to. He was made King (not lord paramount, keeping it in the family) of the Stormland and was married to Gerion Lannister's bastard, Joy Hill.

The game continues currently. I've had two faith of the seven revolts thus far.

Oh, and random bit? *Dany died taking a shit from dysentery.* *~~The more she drank~~* ***~~the more she shat.~~*** So it comes up one day 'Pyat Pree rides Viserion!' Which I was like 'oh shit he took the dragon what a madlad'. Then another random Qartheen person. Then finally a random woman from YiTi rode Drogon. She came to my court, I kidnapped her, and killed her in hopes of getting a dragon. Drogon flew off to a ruin in the Dothraki sea.   


So there was no Breaker of Chains. Thanks for the diarrhoea chapter, George.","I'm going through a House Piper run, pre-Aegon's conquest. I consoled into my family, the fair trait and the brave trait, to match House Piper's family words, ""Brave and Beautiful"". I immediately sought to usurp House Hoare, and denied to assist when they went to war against the Rock for a dejure county of the Trident. Soon after the Hoare's won the war, Harren the Black decided he was upset I didn't help, and tried to revoke my lands. 
I decided to rebel, because hey, what else could I do? Submit to a early game over? Luckily, almost all of the riverlands rose up in rebellion alongside me, and we managed to rush down Harrenhal before the Iron Islands armies could wreak too much havoc on the Riverlands. Immediately decided to claim the throne for myself instead of appointing one of Harren's sons and made Harrenhal my new capital, renaming it to Maidenpearl. New King Alyn Piper promptly built up a small cash fund, bought a favor off of Meria Martell, and used it to make her granddaughter, her heir's heir, marry my own heir, my son. Thus I acquire Dorne peacefully in a few generations. Super lucky playthrough so far since Aegon fucked off to Essos, leaving me to be the new superpower in Westeros.","Kit ""the Cannibal"" Blackfyre 
Lord paramount of the Trident, Alchemist,  and hand of the King. 

Eldest son of Theadora and (I forget his father's name  but he was a Tully) who after his mother was killed during one of the meny Targaryen Civil wars was placed in charge at the age of six.

He was overthrown  a few years later, probably due to him showing signs of insanity in favor of his brother Clarance who proceeded to drink himself to death he was made lord again was overthrown again but eventually  ruled  again.

He would aid in Removing house Targaryen from the Iron throne and placing house Orralion (I think that was the name)  upon it. 

During an epademic he would catch  a thief  stealing  food... and would eat him gaining  the cannibal trait .

During this time he would be made hand of the king and would serve well in the small council. 

Then for some reason the wall fell to Wildlings and the realm  rallied against them.

Kit would fight in this war capturing (and then eating)  the current king beyond the Wall.
At the same time the king was wounded in battle, his wounds  became infected and he died leaving his infant son as king
And of all the people to be made regent for the boy it was Kit blackfyre... who dispite being a lunatic and cannibal he was a good diplomat and steward with a strong sense of  justice.

He would basically rule the seven kingdoms until the boy was of age. And the rest of his rain  remained quiet with him rebuilding the economy, administrating his realm, and working with the alchemists guild.

He would die at the age of 66 after trying to  drink wildfire (don't ask me).","I once had a playthrough (I was Baelish) where Mance did Mance stuff. First he beat the white walkers (lost his two young daughters) then lost to NW and they killed his 4th abd 5th children. But he lived. He rebuilt his kingdom and attacked again. This time his 3rd and 8th child were killed but he won. He then declared war on Rickon + Edmure + Vale (at this point house Baelish had taken over Dorne😂) anyways the Vale clans invaded too. So there ended with the king beyond the wall owning the north. The king of the Vale bending the knee to the king in the north who ruled from River Run (but was a stark). 
Eventually he died. But left no heirs. The Vale clans men had killed the last 2. 

He thanosed himself. “I united the north, what did it cost? Everything” none of his 8 kids lived older than 13.","I was playing 1 year after aegons conquest as Loren lannister and I managed to take the iron throne as him.

I first married and reproduced so I could preserve my dynasty as one of my brothers was on the watch and my other was called by aegon to join the kings guard. Dont remember who I married, not really important.

I eventually betrothed my first son and heir to the daughter of lord Tully and then invaded the riverlands to put her in charge. 

Eventually, aegon died and his son took over but was quickly killed and succeeded by his other son who was homosexual and so easy to convince the realm to depose, with the exception of the storm lands as orys who had tamed baelor the black dread was still around. I managed to depose the gay king and make myself the regent to his lunatic younger brother. Sadly the lords didn't want him either and so orys started another rebellion with just as much support as mine. I then defected to the gay kings side again.

But whilst I was regent I had managed to fabricate a claim on the throne. 

Once the war was won I began my faction. It was me, the riverlands and most of the crown lands whom wanted me as king. Meanwhile the throne had the king, his aunts/mothers, his cousin and orys.

I managed to eventually win by just avoiding dragon riding armies which mostly translated to running away from the stormlands. 

When I won the war I exiled the dragon riding king whom I had deposed for the second time to the nights watch hoping he would do something funny (which sadly he didnt). His brother I simply executed because I do not need dragon riders claiming my throne. All the female targaryens fled Westeros. 

As for house baratheon I let them live because I didn't want to piss off a dragon rider.","My other story is as sigorn thenn in AFFC. I dont think he gets enough love for how free his character can be. 

I chose to join stannis because screw sitting on the wall all game, I want land. 

I was helping stannis fight the boltons and we were winning when aegon beat stannis. Due to the thenn legally being a duchy this meant I couldn't be Stannis' vassal anymore as he was also a duchy so I became aegons vassal. However I was not done yet.

I marched south to the riverlands where I attacked blackwood. The original goal was rivverrun but the garrison reinforced before I could get there so I'll settle for scraps. I managed to eventually beat blackwood and became it's new lord or chief. 

For some reason I was able to immediately the blackwood levies which gave me 2000 men in addition to the 1000 I still had. I used these men to take stone hedge. 

After a few years the white walkers were creaming and there was nobody to stop them so I figured I have to be azhor ahai in honour of stannis. But I couldn't do that without power. So I attacked littlefinger.

Eventually I managed to win and became lord of the trident. Then whilst I was trying to take riverrun from house Frey for a true capital, the white walkers attacked. 

I only had 20,000 men against their 120,000 but I'll be damned if I'm going down without a fight. I managed to fight valiantly, I beat them in many battles, i think in total i killed 50,000 wights, but i simply didn't have the numbers. I surrendered and they took both raventree hall and rivverrun from me, leaving me with just stone hedge. 

The white walkers killed my children and my wife, and I was effectively the last thenn standing. I swore fealty to queen myrcella but sadly some stannis loyalists whom still had land in the north attacked her and caused the mega war to fuck me. The white walkers attacked again and I was losing bad. But I got the last laugh as some random person assassinated me and ended my game before those overhyped zombie fucks could have the pleasure.","The wall fell. As did Winterfell. And Riverrun, the Eyrie, the Rock, and King's Landing.

Daenerys Targaryen, betrayed and heartbroken by her own nephew, watched the continent burn. Then freeze.

She retreated to live atop Dragonstone for decades, as the hordes of undead marched South and brought Winter with them.

By 8330, only Dorne and the Iron Isles existed. by 340, nothing but islands of Westeros persevered. Daenerys Targaryen was Queen of Nothing. She sat atop Dragonstone and didn't rule a kingdom.

But she did rule a cult. Driven mad by the disaster that was her life, she turned to the darkness of Nylarthotep after converting to the old Valyrian faith. She rose through the ranks and became the High Priest.

And bore the son of Darkness once more - the true mount of the world. 

And then she died.

What would her son become? Azor Ahai reborn? The stallion who mounts the world? Time will tell.","Start as Orys Baratheon. Serve Targaryens loyally enough as the kings came and went over the generations. A bit over hundred years later, King Vaemond II goes nuts. Imprisons Lord Arron Baratheon, hand of the king. Ser Arrec Baratheon and Ser Monford Baratheon, Lord-Commander and knight of his own kingsguard. He proceeds to execute them all.   


That leaves Erich Baratheon, the only son of Lord Arron and Princess Shaera Targaryen (The King's elder sister). Who proceeds to go into full Bobby B mode to press his own claim to the throne in revenge. The absolute lad proceeds to defeat the loyalists in deceive battles, gutting Lord-Paramount Theo Tarly of the Reach and Lord-Paramount Lorimar Reyne of the Westerlands.   


In the end, he snags the King's Landing, tosses his mad uncle to oubliette to wait his fate, exiling most of the Targs as he now sits the iron throne as the first Baratheon monarch. All by 160 AC.","My story concerns House Forrester, the same ones from the Telltale game. I was on my very first CK2 GoT playthrough, and had only played the tutorial of the base game prior to that, so I was pretty green and looking for a small, insignificant House to learn the ropes with, and observe the actually important characters go at it from afar. The Forresters fit that bill well. Little did I know, my crappy cliffnote-level family would soon become far more important than I anticipated.  


I started at the Clash of Kings bookmark, controlling Lord Gregor Forrester, who was at the time castellan to Lord Glover. Right off the bat there were a couple of changes in this timeline I spawned. Robb actually wed his Frey wife and didn't get offed at the Red Wedding, only to live for a couple more years and get imprisoned by Joffrey somehow anyway, losing the war and his head with it.  Sansa died from severe stress, still a prisoner in King's Landing, Arya had been gone at the start of the bookmark, and The Greyjoy betrayal event had fired before Robb's death, resulting in the usual disappearance of Bran and Rickon. With no Stark heir, the Karstarks rose to Lord Paramouncy, only for Rickon to later return from Skaggos and claim it back. Anyway, the status of the Stark family so far was none of my doing, but it will be important to the story that follows.  


So, here I am, doing my best to be a dutiful castellan to Lord Glover, learning the game as I go. My eldest son and heir, Rodrik, went and got himself killed bravely fighting the White Walkers, so my second son, Ethan, stood to inherit. I had begun looking for a fit match for him, and betrothed him to Erena Glover, Galbart's niece. Now in this continuity, Galbart himself had an infant son. Being the dutiful castellan that I was, I wished him all the best, but one day, a notification popped up that the child was murdered. The murderer had done a sloppy job and his name was revealled, and he turned out to be none other than my own son, Ethan (who stood to benefit from that death for his own future children's line of succession). Now, with Lord Gregor being honorable and just, I figured I had no choice, but to imprison Ethan and trial him. However, Ethan demanded a trial by combat, summoning none other than his exiled brother Asher as his champion. I had Lord Gregor champion himself. And so I died for the first time, with Asher overcoming his sire in combat.   


Ethan, freshly cleared of all charges, assumed Lordship. His education saw him becoming an intricate webweaver, so I fully transformed into this nw personna. Learning how to scheme in CK2 bit by bit, I started pulling strings in the North, with my eyes set on the High Lordship of Deepwood. Now, in one of the examples of this game's RNG beauty, Ethan met Littlefinger (Lord of Harrenhal and Lord Paramount of the Riverlands at the time) in a feat, and the two became best friends. Littlefinger even gave Ethan a book on intrigue of some kind, which helped to develop Ethan's already considerable intrigue skill. However, my schemes with regards to Deepwood weren't working very well. Erena eventually died after giving me no children, so there was little point to wiping out the Glover line as I had no way to take advantage of it. And that was when I struck gold with another random event.   


I got word that a woman claiming to be Arya Stark had resurfaced... in Harrenhal. Where my dear old friend Littlefinger ruled. Now, quite a few years had passed by now, which meant Arya was in her early 40s - just old enough to maybe still birth a son. A son with claim to Winterfell. And so, a few words to Littlefinger was all it took to get her to marry Ethan. The Old Gods were kind to me, because a few years later, she popped out a son, who, with no other surviving Starks, was next in line to Winterfel after Rickon (who was childless, depressed, and with cancer at the time) and Arya. Plotting Rickon's successful assassination seemed almost mercy at that point, and so Arya, with Ethan by her side, assumed power in the North. Now I poured every coin I had into making their son as well educated as I could make him, and in time, young Gariss Forrester rose to become Lord Paramount of the North, leading to many generations of Forrester Lords, with the name of House Stark slowly fading into obscurity.   


And this is my story of how a small backwood House, controlled by a less-than-inexperienced player, rose to Lord Paramouncy.",Great story.

 great-grandchild of Dany, the only other interesting (or funny depending on how you look at it) part of that game is that I put a stark in control of the westerlands, a lannister in the north, a tyrell in dorne, a targ in the iron islands, and last but not least a farwynd in the stormlands (this was my favorite act because I thought it was funny how a family who has always just had a single county would then be randomly boosted up to the king of the stormlands with his capital still in last light (I allowed royal privileges before granting the iron throne to dany’s great grandkid).

I can't imagine a better  game, and by that I literally mean that before I discovered this mod, my hypothetical idea of the best possible GoT game crafted in a imaginary hype factory with infinite resources and possibilities was less impressive than your actual piece of work.

Thanks to this mod and this subreddit I got to write some funky stuff about something I really enjoyed, and it was the fucking best. 

This post coincidentally coincides with my permanent departure from all things video game/AAR related, but it has been a blast.

I love ASOIAF and CK2, but for some reason I play the mod very little compared to how much I play vanilla.

It's a vast improvement, alone the portrait improvements are awesome.","You're crazy, you can definitely start low. For example House Osgrey is a nice and difficult low starting position.","I've been considering that mod, to be honest, but IIRC it disables ironman and only works for 1066 and later start dates ?","I know you can. But for instance, taking the Reach from the Tyrells is super long and difficult in my experience, and you end up stuck as a Duke-level character for a really long time.","It probably does, I personally do not care for ironman.

HIP works from start dates 867 upwards",Ironman still works on HIP just not achievements ,Isn't that the whole point of starting low? It being long and difficult?,"Well yes, but one thing I like in vanilla is that generally the path between duchies and kingdoms is relatively smooth, but in the mod I feel like it takes forever to go from a Duke-level title to a Kingdom (LP). 

Also the whole crown authority thing is kinda annoying if you'd like to expand while keeping the right dynasties where they belong... Essentially if you want to expand you need to help every rebellion against the crown, as them losing will lower Crown Authority, making your liege unable to brand you a traitor when you declare war. And doing that usually puts random dynasties on the Iron Throne and makes it elective or some random crap :/",So basically my emperor died from fierce sex...,"In my own bed, at the age of 80 with a belly full of wine and a girl's mouth around my cock.",This is my favorite death in the game and it only happened in my most successful play through as Eustace Osgrey's son.

Félix François Faure (30 January 1841 – 16 February 1899) was President of France from 1895 until his death in 1899. Faure was Parisian-born and after working as a tanner in his younger years he became a member of the National Assembly. He became more prominent in French politics up until unexpectedly becoming President, during which time France's relations with Russia improved.

Traits like genius and quick impact hatching chance as well as taming chance, while traits such as strong and authoritative impact taming chance only.

The Valyrian religion gives a pretty significant boost to hatching and taming chance, as do all Valyrian cultures, IIRC. The Targaryen bloodline more or less guarantees success.

I don't think the base chance is quite 1 in 3000, but it's so low that it's not worth trying without proper traits. Even when you make it 5 times easier (through the game rules), you'll see genius characters get themselves killed en masse by trying to hatch dragons. I don't think the AI goes to the places for dragon lore though.

Which brings me to the next point. Dragon lore gives you a significant boost to success. There's some at Summerhall, Bramsfort, Harrenhall, Oldtown, King's Landing, Valyria, Asshai and New Ghis. I think that's all of them, I might have missed some. Maybe there's some in Dragonstone.

Just be in command of an army in said province while holding the egg and you'll trigger the piece of dragon lore.","I don't think so, if you highlight over the traits, culture, and religion it should tell you how much it increases hatching/taming chances.

Bloodlines add some depth in that they also allow for families to have genetic traits, so for example mormont bloodline has 'tends to be strong' as do baratheons, and other families have others such as attractive.

Previously I've battled Rhaegar and won, slain him in the battle of Darry. Aerys was the last Targaryen alive before this. And yes, Daemon died too. With no heirs of my own, both Blackfyre and Targaryen lines have gone extinct forever in the same moment, surrounded by fire and blood.

Kevan died before Tywin so Lancel ""named by halfwit with a *stutter*"" succeeded. Then I removed disinherited trait from Tyrion who was at the time lord of Castamere.

During that time he sends a group to go check out the riverlands and defend them from the mountain who has been raping and pillaging. But then Ned gets executed. But the group he sent out decides to keep following his orders and become a rogue group working to defend the riverlands. This is the Brotherhood without banners.

Arya eventually runs into them and gets captured which is where she meets the hound. Thats also when we see what has happened to the leader of the Brotherhood, Beric.

Anyways, in the books but not in the tv show, after she is killed at the red wedding, Cat Stark is thrown in a river where she is discovered by Beric.

",That's advanced spitefulness right there.,"I started the game when Robert was 15, so he hadn't gotten his education trait yet, somehow ended up with Brilliant Steward though.","Are you saying his traits are OP?

Did Ned end up with Elusive Shadow?","Stuff like that makes my skin crawl. I will always console change it for the canon characters.

Rickard Stark later cut off the Norrey's head.

Start date was 278 AL, I like it because it's all peaceful, the Targaryens are in power, and many familiar characters are alive. 278 because then Rhaegar is unmarried, so I could marry him to Cersei in an alternate universe.","Well, Ned is less skilled than Howland so there you go.",I've actually wanted to try a run where Aerys doesn't turn down Tywin's marriage proposal of Rhaegar and Cersei. Although I see it still turns out weird.,"Cersei always finds a way to screw up her marriages, she's just as bad as Margaery.

I actually tried Rhaegar x Catelyn on a previous run and it worked out amazingly. Fell in love instantly, Catelyn provided me with good looking, white haired intelligent children. Rhaegar and Cersei's daughter on this save had a double chin for whatever reason.","I played a game as Joffrey when Margaery didn't sleep around (or at least didn't reveal it) and of our five children, 4 of them had one or both of Attractive and Quick.

Both my wife and her husband's happened to die simultaneously (actually, didn't involve assassinations).

This is way worse.,"Yes, now you mention it. In all 6 of my latest playthroughs, all of which lasted at least 150 game years, the rate of females to males was significantly favourable to girls. My Velaryon playthrough during Old Valyria I had 8 daughters and 1 boy who was my youngest, which boggled my mind. I feared for the continuation of my line so I married comparatively lowborn men matrilineally. By the time a son was born to me, I was 59 and had 1 male grandson for 5 granddaughters. ","Even in Vanilla, I've noticed that non landed non heir men in my dynasty die off like crazy compared to the women of the same status. I think the game's just trying to thin my herd, which in practice just means I abuse matrilineal marriages far more than I should.","Yeah, my Ironborn with a ton of salt wives only ended up getting salt daughters roughly 80% of the time. That's too many salt daughters. ",Once? Oh my sweet summer child...,"Don't worry, she married Orys Baratheon's son matrilineally. Aegon died without siring any heirs so Orys became king who died soon after. Currently his son his on the throne with a Mudd next in line... ","I know, it's just weird he's only getting daughters despite not being ""of Harrenhal""","Wow, well done. That’s the most successful matrilineal dynasty-making I’ve ever heard of. ",this world is too cruel for baratheons,"I did something similar in a game as the Rogares right after the Dance and once the Three Daughters have fallen:  started with Viserys as a prisoner, force-married him matrilineally to my daughter, Aegon died while still a child so Viserys is king and his heirs are Rogares.  Probably going to console them into High Valyrians to distinguish them from the ones in Lys and since they're taking the throne via their High Valyrian father, may have them convert to the faith but might just see how the revolts are if I don't. 

EDIT:  Oh, and somehow Viserys hasn't hatched his egg, but my daughter managed to find and hatch one and ride the dragon almost immediately upon becoming queen.  That red god dragon bonus, mmm.","My Aegon the Conqueror game was going well for them. Then my Baratheon Lord Commander of the Kingsguard died frothing at the mouth, Orys died in a duel (My Aegon made his killer die screaming.) I forget how Orys other son died but then his youngest grandson ended up being taken hostage at court, Bonded and became friends with Aegon II, the heir to the Vale, and the heir to Dorne’s twin brother. Orys’ slow grandson commits suicide making the friend second in line. I do a cool thing and marry the grandson to an Arryn and remarry his sister to the Heir to the Vale. Then the Dreaded Plague comes and kills all the Baratheon’s except the one who had a kid with the Lord of the Vale, and that kid was a girl who was at my court and betrothed to my heir Baelor. So now the Baratheon’s are dead except for a 52 year old woman with syphilis and the Vale, Stormlands, and Iron Throne are all going to be Targ owned in a generation ",Stupid Stannis!

Humorism, or humoralism, was a system of medicine detailing the makeup and workings of the human body, adopted by  Ancient Greek and Roman physicians and philosophers, positing that an excess or deficiency of any of four distinct bodily fluids in a person—known as humors or humours—directly influences their temperament and health.

The four humors of Hippocratic medicine are black bile (Greek: μέλαινα χολή, melaina chole),  yellow bile (Greek: ξανθη χολή, xanthe chole), phlegm (Greek: φλέγμα, phlegma), and blood (Greek: αἷμα, haima), and each corresponds to one of the traditional four temperaments. A humor is also referred to as a cambium (pl. cambia or cambiums).

While in the Citadel, Maesters learn of the human body, of ravenry and of other sciences, in the Academy, students are taught by their Winged Maesters of history, philosophy, languages, and the arts. Furthermore, the Academy was the first place in Westeros which opened its doors for young girls as well as boys, but the credit for this, many say, must go to Queen Alysanne. Others still may know him as the father of both King Aegon II 'the Glorious' and King Aemon I Mayfly, and maidens dream of a man who would love them as loyally as Jaehaerys loved his Alysanne. What few know, however, is that Jaehaerys started his reign under the regency of his mother, the dowager Queen Alyssa, and for the first few years of his reign was known as Jaehaerys the Boy-King. This boy went on to marry his sister at 16 and fathered eight children on Alysanne, seven of whom survived childhood and almost all of whom were married to their siblings: Aegon, later King; Aemon, his brother's heir; Daenerys, Queen by Aemon's side; Alyssa, a stillborn babe; Baelon, clever and dead before his time; Alyssa of Sunstone; devout Maegelle and cunning Vaegon. The King spent most of the early years of his reign at King's Landing, doting on his young children, building the great roads of Westeros, and starting his Academy; a time of peace and prosperity, which ended with the Conquest of Dorne after the Martells had been carried off by greyscale and their kingdom was crumbling in endless small skirmishes. This taste of blood would only be the beginning, though, and he soon turned eastwards. Before that, we must needs consider the children of Jaehaerys and Alysanne in detail, or the Seven Wyrmlings as they went on to be called: one child for every god, one child for every kingdom.

Crown Prince Aegon was ever a weak and sickly child, with many courtiers doubting his strength. As he grew into a young man, the prince furthermore seemed to prefer the company of other young men to that of young women; he was particularly close to the master-at-arms of King's Landing, and later, when he would rule Dragonstone, Ser Conrad Corbray of the Kingsguard, that famous knight who slayed the outlaw Dale the Wasp. Yet when Aegon chose no less than the Black Dread for his mount, all doubt of his strength vanished, and now the courtiers spoke of him only with reverence. Twice the King tried to marry him to his sister Daenerys, and twice Aegon refused. Ever gentle with his children, Jaehaerys did not force him and instead married Daenerys to Aemon, who loved the Princess fiercely. Aegon was given Dragonstone despite this refusal, and in his first year there, married a daughter of the Crossing behind his father's back, young Tyta Frey who had been at court with her father, master of coin. When he found out about the wedding, the King ordered the newlyweds to his chambers, as well as his Queen and young Aemon and Daenerys. What occured in these chambers that night, we shall never know, but the six talked through the entire night, and by the next morn, Jaehaerys publicly and warmly welcomed his new daughter-in-law. Aegon and Lady Tyta were sent back to Dragonstone, where Balerion's fearsome shadow would be sighted until Aegon's death. The couple had no children, and never conceived, giving Aegon the name 'the Childless' until his own rule.   


The marriage of Aemon and Daenerys was a turbulent one. Passion colored it pink the first few years, when the future King Maerys I and his Queen Rhaenys were born to them. Yet then it cooled; Aemon's paramour Lady Bullock bore a child the same time the Princess fell pregnant, and only when the children were born a week apart - a healthy daughter for Bullock, and a stillborn son for Daenerys - was it obvious that Daenerys, too, had a paramour, for the child was not of Valyrian stock. Lady Bullock was married off to the young Lord of Highgarden - with the promise that in time, their son would be betrothed to a Targaryen princess - and Daenerys' lowborn paramour was gelded and sent to the Wall. The couple reconciled, but never regained the furious passion of their first few years; yet they had two more princesses, Jaehaera and Baela.

Prince Baelon and Princess Alyssa were well-matched in temperament, and both doted on their daughters, fierce Visenya and clever Laena. Their happiness was short-lived, however, as Baelon died aged only 19, of nothing but a common cold. Alyssa's daughter Laena was betrothed to Queen Aerea's grandson Laenor. Aerea, the rebellious daughter of Rhaena, Jaehaerys' older sister, had married a pirate lord after she had conquered the Stepstones with her mount Vhagar, and had two children of him, Aemon and Matarys. Aemon had married Aerea's own twin sister Rhaella, who had birthed Laenor, before Aemon had succumbed to injuries from a battle. Upon the betrothal, Alyssa accompanied her little daughter to the Stepstones. There, she found a second chance for love in the arms of her cousin Matarys, the second of Queen Aerea's sons, two years older than her. Laenor and Laena grew up close, and married happily once they came of age, and we all know of the great deeds done by this King of Silver and his Queen of Gold, as they would come to be known, for Laenor's silver hair and Laena's proficiency with coin.

Princess Maegelle and Prince Vaegon had no great romance, but no great tragedy either. Both siblings were dutiful, and so gave the royal couple a granddaughter which they named Alysanne for the child's grandmother, and the long-awaited second grandson Rhaenor. Rhaenor was married to Baela once he came of age, and the remaining granddaughters of the Philosopher were each married off to a corner of the realm: Fierce Visenya was sent to Prince Josua of Dorne, founding a dynasty to which our current Princess of Dorne can trace her lineage. It is said that Prince Josua could only defeat his Princess beneath the sheets and never on the training grounds, for Visenya had shown a lust for weapons even as a child, like her namesake. Alysanne was married to young Rolland Tyrell to honor a promise with the King's favorite grandchild's hand, and lived a happy life in Highgarden. Wroth Jaehaera found her match with Joffrey Arryn, who, it was said, was the only man who could soothe the anger within her heart. After the birth of Rhaenor, Maegelle purportedly never fell pregnant again - Vaegon showed more interest in books, and Maegelle in praying, yet the couple continued to live as siblings and raise their children lovingly.

Please continue with Aegon!,I just want aemon or baelon to succeed jaehaerys and not fucking die before him,Am I tripping or do you have 2 education traits? If so how do you do that?,How do you conquer Essos as King of the Iron Throne. Fabricate claims?,"...   
  The children and grandchildren of the Philosopher tripled the number of dragons in the world. The names of these wyrms are writ large in Westerosi history, and every child today knows of Solstice and Whiteclaw, Grey Ghost and Taelar, Volon 'the Liberator' and Caraxes Redscale, and Naerion and Tyriax the White Pearl, but back then, those dragons were still small and barely able to carry their riders on their backs. It was Vermithor, Silverwing, Balerion, Meleys the Devourer, and Queen Aerea's Vhagar who conquered and later held the Eastern lands - but this came later, only after the Academy was built. It is said that Jaehaerys was given the idea of building his Academy after flying on Vermithor's back to Dorne after conquering it. 'Ordinary men cannot hope to fly on a dragon's wings,' he is quoted, 'yet any man can soar on the wings of knowledge.' This quote gave the Maesters of the Academy their title of Winged, to differentiate them from the Citadel's Maesters - these men and women sail in the sky on their wings of knowledge, and strive to give the same to their students. After building his Academy and his network of roads, the King visited the Academy's lectures himself, where he pondered on what makes a man a man, and once again, he thought of his time on Vermithor's back. He came to the conclusion that freedom was what made man man, and it was what united all, from the poorest fellow in Flea Bottom to dragonriders themselves: the freedom to decide their own fate. By the same token, he realized that slavery was stripping man of all that made him so, a crime against nature itself. The Queens Alysanne and Aerea and his sister Rhaena were the first to learn of his plans to force Essos to abolish that barbaric practice, and became his greatest supporters in the years to come. For this reason, the Conquest of the East is also called the Women's Wars, for on dragonback, these three women - gentle Alysanne on Silverwing, vicious Aerea on Vhagar, and smart Rhaena on Meleys the Devourer - were fearsome indeed, more fearsome even than the King on Vermithor. 

    
  The first polite, diplomatic requests to the Free Cities to stop their slaver's business had no effect, and so Jaehaerys chose to bring Fire and Blood to these 'enemies of humanity', as he called them. His women followed him, as did his vassals, with Lords Loreon Lannister, Prentys Tully and Osric Arryn distinguishing themselves with their efforts. Pentos fell in the first war in 77, then came Volantis and Myr in 84. Braavos fought on the side of Tyrosh in the next war in 89, and so both Braavos and Tyrosh were conquered. Jaehaerys, Prince Aegon, and Rhaena, who was the King's Hand in her last years, flew to Lorath together, without the King's armies, to declare war on the lands in 95. Lorath, back then, was governed by three Princes, whose names are lost to history except for Prince Meralyn 'the Sly'. He demanded a combat, three against three, as there were three princes of Lorath and three Targaryens, and they could each nominate one champion. If Lorath's champions won, Lorath would surrender without spilling blood, and if Jaehaerys' champions won, Lorath would be left alone by Targaryens for eternity. Jaehaerys wished to reject the proposal, but Aegon, never one to back down from a challenge, and Rhaena, always a step ahead of everyone else, together pushed him into accepting the terms. They had brought one Kingsguard each, on the back of their dragons, all of them fiercely loyal. The Lorathi Princes brought out the greatest warriors of Lorath - first, a man who claimed his father had been a leviathan from the deep ocean, a man who was broad and ugly, but with a strength that could subdue a hundred foes; second, a woman from the island of Ibben, who was covered in black hair all over and towered over all three Targaryens; and third, a Dothraki horselord, fearsome to behold with two curved arakhs at his sides and an uncut braid reaching his ankles. It is said that Jaehaerys grew pale at the look of these warriors, and Aegon visibly recoiled. Only Rhaena did not react. 'Who will you name as your champions?' said Prince Meralyn, and Jaehaerys took one look at his knightly companions - all three of whom could never hope to match these monsters in a melee - and his own son before he drew Blackfyre from its sheath, willing to sacrifice his life to spare at least one of them certain death. Yet Rhaena lowered his weapon, and stepped forward. A small woman, her silver hair now grey, she could not hope to match any single of these monsters of men, even less all three. 'Prince Meralyn, you have forgotten who we are. We may wear three heads on our coats, but Targaryens have never needed more than one champion. My brother's champion shall be my own beloved Meleys!' she bellowed, and with a roar, her dragon appeared behind her. This was the day Meleys the Devourer received her name, as she descended upon the three warriors, opened her jaws, and swallowed them one after the other. Lorath had no choice but to surrender.   

  
  The tale of Lorath's surrender spread far and wide, and suddenly, the Essosi lords and princes saw no more reason in fighting these new dragonlords. Qohor and Norvos surrendered, as did the colonies along the Rhoyne. Even now, slavery was not eradicated, and so, on his deathbed in 97, Jaehaerys made Prince Aegon promise he would complete his life's work, to bring the dragon's justice as far as the Dothraki Sea and Slaver's Bay. The Crown Prince, Aegon 'the Childless' had never forgotten his father's indulgence in his youth, and so when the Philosopher died, Aegon was crowned by the High Septon and the very next day mounted Balerion to fly to Meereen... But the journey of Aegon 'the Childless' to become Aegon 'the Glorious' is another story, to be told another day. Jaehaerys, it is said, died happily, with his beloved Alysanne's hand on his cheek, his great-granddaughter Naerys' laughter in his ears, and a smile on his lips.","Some dumb random stuff from that playthrough: 

* because all the Martells died of greyscale, Dorne elected a Toland lady as their new Princess, who held her throne for all of 6 months, and then another Prince, a 10 year old rando from an AI generated (?) House - definitely not a canon house??? Really strange? But I guess now House Solavar reigns in Dorne...?! 
* Aegon declined marrying Dany twice, so I thought ""okay, just stay a gay bachelor all your life and let Aemon inherit, buddy"" and then he went to marry that Frey?? Even though I had restricted his marriages??? I'd already started plotting and the plot was almost through - the balcony railings were loose already - when I saw that she was also gay by the grace of the gods, so I allowed Aegon his LGBT sanctuary Dragonstone and let her live - and with the -15% fertility they never made any children. 
* Aerea just took Vhagar and went and conquered Sunstone and her random pirate husband. My girl really out there living the dream. I conquered the rest of the Stepstones and gave them all to her as a gift from royal cousin to royal cousin, and later I annexed that kingdom. (She was allowed to keep her royal title.)  
* Lorath, Norvos, and Qohor surrendered literally a second after a declared war on each of them. I suppose they knew they had no chance. 
* Lys is still unconquered because I warred against them after the Braavos-Tyrosh war by way of an invitation of Asshai (???) to join their war against Lys. We defeated Lys, of course, but then it turned out that I couldn't conquer it because it hadn't been my war... so now we're in a truce until 102... ugh... 
* I really liked that university bloodline, and I found it extremely in-character for Jaehaerys. 
* Jaehaerys got horrible burn scars when he tried to force Balerion into the dragonpit early in his reign. I believe he was very thankful when Aegon managed to tame the beast.","Thanks very much!

A few generations in, the current King of the Vale was half stark on his mother's side and decided to push his claim to for the North one day. 

At this point I had been fabricating a claim on the Neck for sometime, and during the Vale-North war, I finally got the claim. So I declared war and faced a Northern host near Moat Cailin, led by the Stark King himself.

King Robb Stark (AI generated name, btw) slew a kinsman lord of mine in battle, so we chased him across the neck and just as we were about to shatter his host, the Knights of the Eyrie stormed in and slaughtered the wolves of winter. They took King Robb hostage and promptly declared the war over... before I could finish my war over the neck.

After ransoming off minor Stark princes (former princes, I should say) Lord Robb died in a trial by combat, leaving his 3 year old son Jonnel as Lord of Winterfell. My cousin, Edwyle Stark, half Blackwood half Stark, joined my court. I'm hoping to take the Neck and *then* press his claim.

While playing as Damon Darry after my first guy’s death I defeated Bobby B and imprisoned him. Stannis became LP and Rhaegar revoked the Trident from Edmure and gave it to me. I then became the best Riverlands LP ever even Edmure loved me.

Then I became Regent while Rhaegar was declared incapable and after a year he got out of his room and overthrew me. He then tried to imprison me so I fought back and started this war.

Anyway I though I had a pretty easy shot at winning until the Mannis tore up my deathstack and I lost a major battle soon after this.

","First time for me as well, must be down to being lucky :)","It’s not easy to. Having someone who can force train to skilled warrior and having someone who can potentially get the child to poor or trained warrior before they’re 8 is also helpful. And then having a guardian who is a formidable fighter also helps.

The first I did it, Jaime Lannister was my guardian. Second time I did was during the Valyrian Steel quest, because there’s a 5% chance to upgrade to formidable if you take he warrior and beat him in the play fight.

However, the single most accomplished time was when I was a custom high valyrian. I raised a daughter to be a formidable fighter. She was ranked skilled by 8 years old. It was crazy.  She was also genius, attractive, warg. And her martial was lower than both intrigue and diplomacy. She was easily the best female character I’ve ever had. RNGesus was just on her side.

Having a skilled warrior or formidable fighter with martial above 20 helps significantly, and then having yourself be skilled works wonders too.

This is why a daughter should be educated to be well mannered & groomed, to make a good impression on the king. After all marriage only takes place after negociation in middle ages its not a request/accept thing.

I really dislike the system of having a maester with 20% chance per year child improves and 10% child is uncooperative. Of course youre really happy when your child becomes just. But if he becomes slothful, that child should never educate his/her future children because having slothful/shy/craven trait replicates itself. Education is a process, it is influenced by events but not determined by it. Also why does attending tournaments make characters more stupid? Shouldnt you learn from experience (thats my other complaint, education shouldnt stop at 16)?","Oh I know, but the garrison there means nothing if there isn't a defending army is more what I was getting at.

If Robb marches straight to King's Landing, we are likely seeing King Stannis of the Six Kingdoms, and Robb as a King of an independent North, like how it ended in the show, just with a real King for the Six.

We saw the Battle of the Blackwater...even with that great wildfire explosion, Tyrion needed Tywin to save their asses...now, imagine if Robb just marches...even if they meet Tywin, that means Stannis wins, no matter if Robb wins or loses.  If Robb wins, even with a third or half of his forces, he has enough to force a depleted Stannis to diplomacy.

It is why the show ending is so stupid... the Iron Throne is always vulnerable as the King has no military.  He is reliant on other Lords as he has no holdings of his own.  Joffrey honestly DID have one good idea...he knew the King needed a standing army, and didn't have one.

Try and get someone who's the best at what they do, brilliant commander, elusive shadow, grey eminence, etc. Use that person to educate your heir. In the end, if you pull it off correctly you should never get cancer until you're like 70. Formidable fighter is 1.50+ health, strong is 1+ health +10% fertility.

Based off his story i assume he also turned off AI inheritance protection laws and argella should never agree to matrilinneal marriage with his father.

Sure it could be on the up and up, seeing as how he already openly admits to doing some things that aren't always viewed as legit, its not a far stretch to assume some other mods or some other abuse of game mechanics aided his quest(there are a lot of mods out there that work in ironman that could do so).

However, in any single combat with a reputable warrior or a militant Knight?  He'd be beaten before the swords met five times.  Hell, in the show he is nearly killed by a lone Dornish regular while Bronn fights off three... the only reason he survives is he is able to grab the death blow with his steel hand.

I personally don't even think I sounded rude.  Just factual.  The statement isn't true in game or in any of the source material.  The normal ""One-Handed"" bonus is going to keep him from the top tier.

Will he probably still be ""good"" under CK2?  Sure, probably, it is an imperfect system and all.

It is *-80* for one-handed when you hover on PCS.  

Jaime is at 60 PCS at the start of ""A Feast for Crows"" -- I used Euron just to jump in and start research, as I'm not actually playing, just to see the difference, as we all know what happens in the show...

Yeah, Euron got a bad roll in the show, considering he outranks Jaime by *65* PCS points...

Firstly, I murdered Aegon with a shadow baby. This allows you to then raise your levies from the Stromlands. Group these levies into one stack and use them to counter smaller enemy stacks that filter into your lands. Tommen and Cersei will raise their armies quickly though so you need to watch out and make sure your army doesn't get hunted down. Simply use Fabian tactics to deny them any substantial warscore from battles and preserve your army for the time being. (I'd advise maybe getting some organizers in your Southern army in order to outrun your enemies).If you have the Monks and Mystics DLC, use the allied AI attach orders to your advantage. The Florents and Meadows have troops with you in the North, but they are part of your war for the North. Therefore, order them to attach to your Southern army. This will add a few thousand more men to your cause in the South, which should be your main focus for the time being. In the North march your army South and hunt down the smaller Bolton stacks before they can mass in a larger army. Be aware of the attrition though, I once got a good third of my army wiped out in just a few weeks from it.  Now, it is almost impossible to win unless Rickon is found or Jon Snow joins you. In my case, Jon thankfully joined me. This causes most of the North to rally to your side. Taking the North after that should be a piece of cake. Once the North is under Rickon or Jon's control, they should join your war for the Iron Throne. As long as you keep your army far away from the Tommens forces in the South, it will take them some time to amass 100% warscore with just occupation. With the banners of the North behind you, most of the hard work is done. Concentrate your forces and hunt down enemy stacks. If possible, rush Kings Landing and take the city before Tommen and Myrcella go into hiding. If not, the war will have to go on for some time, but if you focus your forces and crush the enemy, the Iron Throne should be yours soon enough. However, what's important to note is that I've played Stannis AFFC at least half a dozen times and only won once, so it certainly requires quite a lot of luck to say the least. Not dying before you have the throne is even a challenge in itself.","Stannis only feels right in Clash of Kings, I find him easiest to win with when Rob is still alive pounding Tywin. 

My fav, but hard as fuck, is Littlefinger at AFFC",He is *Aegon of Essos*. The house is *of Essos*. He'll be under the vassal of Illyrio Mopatis iirc,It's in the suggested character sheets on the left of the starting page,"Can Stannis find the stark children or is it only Jon? AFAIK it’s not RNG it’s having your commander lead an army to where they are(Arya in bravos, bran north of the wall in the white walkers court IIRC, and rickon in Skaggos. They won’t be of the stark line initially, but you’ll know you have the right kids if they have the firewood trait)","If you're willing to use shadow babies, wouldn't it make more sense to just kill Tommen and Myrcella and be done with it?","He turns into a Targaryen if he takes the throne, I assume? House *of Essos* sounds pretty lame","Thanks, no wonder I couldn't find him, I was looking in Westeros.","Stannis can find Rickon through RNG (or not, I'll have to play as Davos to find out). He can't find them the normal way.","I think it's only a Stark that can find the Stark kiddos through going to certain areas (Arya - Bravos, Bran - Capital of Winter, Rickon - Skaggos)

For Stannis it just all depends on RNG if Ol'Dave can actually find Rickon and that's just it",It keeps one 10k stack from sieging Stormlands and instantly eliminates one opponent.It also allows you to move your levy army from Stormlands to the North and keep your forces together whereas you would have to keep one army defending Stormlands from Aegon and IT and just slowly lose the war,Yes or alternately if Danny chooses to just follow Illyrio’s plan and marry him he also becomes a Targ,Yes he will turn to a Targaryen,If you kill Tommen and Myrcella you’re the next in line for  the throne and will succeed by default,"But you will still have to win a war with fAegon ,where pretty much everyone hates you because you are R'hllor ,you still have war in the North and if fAegon is married to Dany he will have 25k army with 3 dragons and really good commanders . Winning IT might seem easier your way ,but with a bit of luck you can also capture them sieging KL giving you the same with IT and less problems with keeping it","fAegon isn't normally married to Dany, his commanders all suck compared to Stannis's, and even Dorne joins him only half the time. And if you get Rickon or Jon, you don't even have to fight in the North, the Northmen will win it for you.","He isn't ,but he might be if you let him live for a while and that's certainly a bigger threat than Myrcella and Tommen. Also once you get rid of Lannisters and get the IT ,everyone hates you more than fAegon so they will more likely join him than you.","The thing is that unless you win the IT as soon as possible, your stupid SL vassals will run headfirst into Lannister hosts and Tommen racks up 50% warscore from that alone. The IT is by far the bigger threat, especially since Cersei will tend not to join the war on Aegon’s side unless you were discovered.","The IT is the largest threat, but I personally didn't use shadow babies on them as I would have to do it twice for Tommen and Myrcella, which is risky. However, that would certainly be a way that you could win for sure, but you might just die before you can produce an heir other than Shireen due to the health decrease from two shadow babies.",I'm more impressed of the fact that he lived to 101,"""There will be no more burnings.

Jamie Lannister was captured in the battle of the Trident after avenging Rhaegar's death to Robert.

Aerys successfully burned King's Landing as Eddard Stark, Tywin Lannister, and Jon Arryn invaded it.  

The capital is now Riverrun, where Jamie Lannister and Lyanna Stark rule the seven kingdoms with a gentle and fair hand. 

Jon Rivers is a spoiled brat with a little lord Fauntleroy bob cut and absolutely no sense of duty nor skill with a sword. 

Stannis, bitter over his brother's death and being commanded to hold Dragonstone, leaving Renly and Cersei Lannister occupying his birthright, takes the black. His grit and military education allows him to quickly rise to Lord Commander. The night's watch, under his stern and unrelenting leadership, repel both the wildlings and the white walkers. 

Cersei and her femboy husband live a happy life where they both get to fuck whatever man they please, and Cersei has three boys and a girl ""by Renly""

.............

Think how much better a place the world would have been if Aerys had actually sent Jamie to Rhaegar. 

Except for the people of King's Landing. They're fucking dead lmao","It's never said that Jaime had any dislike for Rhaegar.

He actually liked him decently if you read the books. He even admired him to some extent. Just like he did with alot of other members of the King's Guard.

The only real reason he turned on king Aerys was his madness.

I'd think that if Rhaegar succeeded Aerys sooner, Jaime would have staid loyal to him.

",I knew he admired him but I wasn’t aware that he begged rhaegar to take him with him to dragonstone,are you aware there are built in programs on all computers that allow users to take screenshots? ,"Jaime was a friend of Rhaegar, even looked up to him. When the war started he begged Rhaegar to take him with him.","You joke, but I honestly think Jaime and Lyanna would have made a good couple (even if you discount the fact that anyone is better for him than Cersei. A fucking dog would be better for him that Cersei, because at least dogs can comfort you when you're sad.) ","Except that they didnt go to Dragonstone...
","I honestly don't understand why so many people bitch so much about this. Is an easier, quicker way to share something and you can see and read everything just fine. ",Not that deep as friends. But Rhaegar trusted Jaime was the right man to be at the capital. In a way he was saving the city by killing his king but he also was not able to save Rhaegar's wife and children. ,"Never knew that, pretty cool!",Joke? Who said anything about a joke? ,"Never doubt that a dog is loyal. Cersei, however, is even fucking moonboy.",I know he never did but I’m just saying that I wasn’t aware of the extent of Jamie’s admiration for Rhaegar,Yeah I do screenahots nowadays just so people don't tell me to take srceenshot. I didn't even notice this wasn't a screenahot tbh.,I often times wonder what would have happened if Jaime had killed Aerys and then protected Elia and the children. It’s not like the mountain would have harmed him to get at them. ,"I think the irony of the whole thing was Rhaegar had a respect for Jaime as a man who had a code (yes his code isn't faultless - he shoved a 9 year old out a window) but he knew that Jaime was the kind to not blindly follow the King's orders, remember the ""and are we not sworn to protect the Queen?"" ""Aye but not from him"" line. Jaime was never like Arthur Dayne or the other Kingsguards who were part of Rhaegar's circle, but he Rhaegar probably wanted to leave at least one Kingsguard behind who would put principle over the King's Orders.",Everyone but Robert think that Rhaegar was cool.,"We don't know. At this point and time, they were enemies. Nobody would've known who killed Aerys either and I feel like that was important to Jaime","GRRM is so great. He made an irresponsible, unaccountable, superstitious, unfaithful, self-absorbed prince into a mythical legend in the books, and, in the process, managed to get many readers to overlook everything they know about him and view him favorably with other characters.",yeah but I dont think the mountain or at least Amory would be dumb enough to kill Tywins son,"Rhaegar sure messed things up, but Targaryens got away with much crazier stuff than what he pulled off.",You’re right. I never realized how much I’ve overlooked what a shitty guy he was.,"The trick is make him handsome. That cliche even has its own tv troupes page. Draco in lether pants.

Not matter how shitty a character is, make him handsome and all women will want to fuck him and all men will want be him.","Tywins a cold son of a bitch, he would have cut his losses ","You know, you're spot on now that i think about it. It's easy to think of Robert as worse than he is because he doesn't have the kingly look, and of Rhaegar as better because he looked the part and the whole thing with Lyanna is the average romantic story","I seriously doubt Tywin would see Jaime's death as an acceptable loss. One of his big reasons for being so bitter towards the Targaryens was them putting Jaime on the Kingsguard, which left him with Tyrion as his heir. And when the Lannisters have full control of the iron throne via Joffery and Cersei, iirc Tywim tries to get Jaime off the KG to make him his heir again. With all that in mind I don't think Tywin would be okay with his prized son being killed by his own men",This is also assuming that ser steroid the mountain could actually beat Young Jaime. I know there’s a vast size matchup but beyond Dayne or Barristan there wasn’t a better warrior in the entire 7K. If Ser amory and The mountain came across Jaime in the white cloak at Maegors I’m predicting two dead westerman who don’t have the name Lannister. ,Amory would be dead in seconds but Gregor is pretty much a tank. Given that he was also much younger and likely a bit more agile it'd be an interesting fight.,"Doesn't Jaime say that Gregor is one of the few men in the 7 kingdoms that has a chance against him? His armour is said to be so thick no one else could wear it and still move, he's basically a human tank. I reckon two on one it would be a tough ask for Jaime especially with not a lot of space to move","My bastard brother was one of the best spymaster and he got formidable fighter and other traits too plus he was a rival (because i cucked his wife), he just keep scheming to kill me and when i get him and imprisoned him in a matter of days he escaped to Essos, build an army then started a war against me. It's one hell of a war bcause Vale, Reach, and Stormlands are friends with him and The North was stayed neutral. I've been able to put him down after loss countless warriors and 3 of my formidable fighter in my court (one of them is my Kingsguard).","This one was quite normal, but he always embarrassed me during feasts. He used to get drunk until pass out. EVERY DAMN FEAST. One day I got sick of his stupidity and plotted to kill him.
Interestingly, I invited one of his ""lovers"" to the plot. It seems that the lover got drunk and the plot was discovered.
Not only I got the ""dishonorable"" trait, but also my character died a month later because he was really really old.
Do you wanna know how the story ended?
Since there was no other heir, I had to play with HIM.
Right when I started, he died from too much drinking.
",Maybe my brothers bastard kid lost an eye when using a practice sword at the age of 9 ,She wasn’t my bastard but my first born sons. Basically my kid was too nice for his own good and legitimatized her and with an Agnatic-Cognatic succession law (due to my own bad habit of losing sons) the little shit had it in her head that she was gonna rule the northern tribes.  So every time my son had a son the bitch would murder them she started her killing spree at age 7 and by the time she was 16 she racked up I think it was 3-5 babies  and possibly one wife.

Perhaps an easy solution would be to notify you whenever a major event occurs to any king, warden (lord paramount), petty king, in your De Jure empire (Westeros for example).

In my playthroughs as a lord under the Gardner king's, he either gets rekt by a coalition of the North and reach or fucks off to Essos.... where he then fucked by Lys of all nations.",Looks like the took Dragonstone.,"Yea i've seen that happen plenty of times. mostly in The Bleeding Years start though, Argilac slaps Aegon like a boy and puts him in his place. Mostly cause Aegon can't use Dragons effectively and Argilac uses that opportunity. same goes for Harren, i've seen Harren give Aegon a good asswhooping aswell.

TL;DR : Aegon can't do much without his Dragons.","It's so easy if you have a big dragon, you just one shot any army and fort in 2 clicks",Did he get imprissoned in battle?,Ubercharged them with blood magic or something,Nope all are five (Meraxes even had a kid),I thought the damage to a fort is only 20%,no,Depends on the dragon's size (That's their martial),"have you never had a big dragon?

play as aegon during the conquest or maegor during the faith uprising, thats when baelerion is in his prime, roast thousands of peasants that dared face you in battle or cook everyone alive inside their castles as you melt the stone into candle wax.

That can be done even with 5-martial dragon, light infantry always dies out like flies",He just... lost,He is sitting at -152 gold,"Tip: it relates directly to the amount of damage they do.

10 (Or lower) martial will do 10% 20 will 20% and so on.

The reason Balerion is so OP is that he has 104 at the start, so he one shots anything.",it can be done with ten hvy cav. LI always dies like flies,Yea you are forced to pay money when you lose a war as an attacker. So no idea how it happened? Cuz if not likely he did get imprissoned in battle,"Looks like Rhaenys is imprisoned, so it might’ve ended cus of that.",Historically accurate at least,"Won the war and took the throne as Daemon, managed to capture Maekar and Bloodraven during the war, Baelor and Daeron were imprisoned after the war had ended. I declared Daeron a bastard, the offspring of Aemon the Dragonknight instead of my father Aegon IV. I called everyone for trial winning each trial by combat, thus, killing off the majority of the Targaryen pretenders. I then dueled Rhaegel using the war focus, and as hes a lunatic he accepted the duel and was easily killed. Daerons last remaining son Aerys died due to illness shortly after. My firstborn Aegon holds dragonstone and my secondborn Aemon holds Summerhall, My half-brother Bittersteel holds the riverlands and riverrun, the black dragon reigns supreme.",How’d you avoid any kinslayer traits?,Now this is some good content I like to see. Good to see another supporter of the true rightful rulers 😤😤,"Now you just need to do the same with his modern-day descendant, the mummer's dragon.","Dude how did you conquer Dorne without them rebelling and declaring independence? In the books had Daemon won they would have likely  done so. Also shouldn't Daemon once taking the throne be called Targaryen? As if he wins it means that he's the rightful Targaryen King and that Daeron II was actually a bastard by Aemon the DragonKnight. So shouldn't thre be a mechanic to make Dameon known as Daemon ""The Blackfyre"" of House Targaryen? Canonically it would make more sense as their claim to the throne rests on them being the true legitimate branch of Aegon I TARGARYEN.",10 kids at 32? Good lord,"Which bookmark/year did you use? Looks like fun!

Did you declare Daemon a bastard by plot? What a hypocrite 😂",I got an event from the faith to get rid of it.,You can get the high septon to absolve kinslaying if the person you killed was evil.,The king who bore the sword!!,"The majority of the lord paramounts revolted against me when i tried to take their titles, so i had to win another set of wars. After i won, i gave the westerlands to the reynes, the reach to house  osgrey, the vale to house strickland and dorne to house yronwood, basically influential houses who supported me during the rebellion. The north, the stormlands, and tyrosh fought on my side. 

It wouldnt make sense to make Daemon a member of house targaryen as thats not exactly how it works with legitimized bastards. Daemon was legitimized by his father aegon and everyone knows that, when he was legitimized he was given the right to make his own house and remove the taint of being a bastard. Daemon had his own lands and incomes as well and that could be another reason why he took a new family name. Daemon chose to create house blackfyre to represent the difference between him and daeron, and the fact that he bore the sword blackfyre (known to be the sword of kings, aegon the conquerors sword). Daemon never really liked the majority of the targaryens at the time (beyond bittersteel and his parents) and wanted to create his own legacy, so that could be another reason why he didnt take the name.",that would be awesome,"He starts with all those kids at the beginning of that bookmark, so he actually had them all like a decade earlier.","The first blackfyre rebellion bookmark. Its a really fun one. Theres a special decision where you can make daeron a bastard if you win the war. Technically daemon was legitimized so that means he can inherit, if daeron was aemon the dragonknights bastard he would be disqualified from inheritance as he was never legitimatized, thats why id say its not hypocritical in a sense.",Osgrey isn't really influential. Though it kinda funny that you gave the reach to an house without Garth's blood like the Florents. So the reach was cucked by two dragon kings,A baby-making machine,"I did say influential houses who supported me in the rebellion as there were a lot of smaller houses who supported me. I would say Osgrey isn't influential during this bookmark as they've lost all their lands by now, but historically they are ""House Osgrey was established at least 1,000 years before the Conquest. The family used to be Marshalls of the Northmarch under House Gardener. At that time they possessed four castles and were done fealty by a score of lesser lordlings and a hundred landed knights."" Osgrey isn't as influential as some of the other reach houses though, the reason I gave it to them was that Eustace Osgrey lost all of his sons fighting for the Blackfyre cause in the lore, so I wanted to give back to them, the Peakes were in close contention but I felt that Osgrey deserved it more.","Okay fair enough. I actually really like the osgreys. if I play in the reach, which I never really do, it's as an Osgrey or a custom character. Did you give them Highgarden?","I gave them highgarden and all of the lands they had under the gardener kings, so the high lordship of the northmarch and coldmoat.","My roleplay says good, but my ck2 says why'd make them even more powerful. Thus my conflict whenever I play this mod","I think it adds to the entertainment for me. If people rebel in the future and its a difficult rebellion to squash it adds more challenge and fun to the game in general, that's why I prefer roleplaying based on my characters rather than playing to reduce difficulty at every turn. The games I've had the most fun with have been the ones where i've really been roleplaying, and the games that are the least memorable are the ones where i've used all the gamey tactics to gain land and manage my vassals, things get boring when you steamroll easily.",As soon as you get the iron throne you steam roll though. I never have been deposed because other lord paramount's always beat up the others for me whenever 1 rebels. And then I just conquer Essos again,Sounds like you could use that R’hllor health plan,"I'd be stressed too, shit.","Stressed, but not depressed. At least he hasn't given up hope.",Now I'm curious.

Everyone has actually died early in this game. My father Yohn Royce died after only five years. Andar here is already dead, but Dani managed to spawn an heir a year before. Then I married her matrilineally to an Arryn of Gull Town to unite their bloodlines for - let's just call it breeding purposes. But Stannis' heir (Stannis also died) found Dani and exiled her. Now I have a half-brother in Tolos with both Targaryen and Arryn blood lines. My current character (Andar's son Raymar Royce) have just come of age a couple of years ago. I am about 35-40 years into the game and there have already been grey plaque, bloody flux and now a third dissease. Really challenging game. I already have a daughter.

When Yoren died in 7997 his son Cletus succeded and early on took Skyreach  with Ulrick personally killing Lord Fowler but getting scarred which earned him the nickname ""The Scarred"" and aranging  marriage between his son Ulrick (who was one of the best commanders in Dorne) and the Genius Ariane Drinkwater. Ulrick had multiple sons but his greatest and favourite child was Yorick Yronwood a strong and genius son. Cletus sent the older brothers of Yorick to the Citadel and Nights Watch to secure his succession. Ulrick became lord in 8010 at an oportune time, The Princess just died and had only left a 10 year old Selyse Durrandon on the Throne. So Ulrick seized the oportunity rebelled alongside his ally Gerold Dayne. They won the war quickly and Ulrick was named and crowned King of The Redmarch. House Dayne became a vassal of House Yronwood after Gerrolds death. Ulrick went missing 11 years into his reign while trying to obtain a Valyrian Steel Sword for House Yronwood and his son Yorick became KIng at age 21 and just 2 years later he turned back a Reach Invasion and killing King Garse Gardner and his son Garth. Yorrick then vassalised Houses Manwoody, Fowler, Blackmont and Qorgyle after their own wars of Independance aswell as finding a Valyrian Steel Sword for House Yronwood. He ruled for 41 years and was the most famous Yronwood to date. He died of old age and was succeeded by his son Edgar Yronwood who finished his fathers conquests taking the rest of Dorne and crowning himself Prince of Dorne. Edgar also expanded Yronwood Castle to become a Huge Fortress. Edgar died age 50 and was succeeded by Yoren Yronwood who took The Dornish Marches and some of The Stepstones. The current head of House Yronwood is Prince Yorick named after his legendary great grandfather King Yorick.

In the custom game setup there should be a calander/clock thing right in the middle of the top of the page. Use that to go back a few years from Roberts rebellion and Jaime should be your heir. Probably want to marry him off to make sure he can't take any vows though.","Fire event 37352 as Tywin at the start of the clash of Kings bookmark. Jaime will become your heir, be removed from the Kingsguard, AND be freed from Robb's captivity (bug but still nice if you're Tywin). I always do it even when I'm playing Robb or someone else. Games always paused when I do it. Don't know if that has any impact.

The event probably works in other bookmarks but you have to meet certain conditions.",If he hasn’t been killed or sent to the wall and Stannis takes the throne there is a possibility that he could be removed from the KG.

If you do then ransom him out, he'll be Tywin's heir.","If Joffrey executes Sansa then I kill Jaime immediately after. Otherwise I usually just make him take the black, kill Joffrey, and imprison Tommen.",Nah I want Jaime ruling the Westerlands so I try to keep him alive,Every ACOK start i play sansa and jaime are immediately beheaded,"True. Although you could take the loss of Joffrey on the Iron Throne, allowing Jaime to leave the KG and then fabricate a claim on the IT yourself. Win that and you become King of Westeros and your heir is now your favorite non-dwarf son.","Does Joffrey ever NOT execute Sansa? 

I don't think I've saved her once.",[deleted],I rescued her as Stannis numerous times for obvious reasons,I've seen it once where he marries her.,"I was thinking he may not want to publicly seen deposing his own grandchild, even if he saw him as unfit. Tytos Lannister was known as the Toothless Lion for his underwhelming rule of the Westerlands and Tywin never tried to kill/depose him. Tywin’s entire M.O. is that he does everything to strengthen his dynasty’s reputation. If the members of his immediate family are seen fighting each other it could lessen their overall social value.

Then again my scenario also isn’t great because a Joffrey loss makes him known as the true son of Jaime and Cersei. Tywin probably wouldn’t be happy if his twins were proven to be incestuous deviants, even if it was basically an open secret at that point.",Neat portrait mod.,"This is peak medieval politics.

Outside this rumor and the claims made by singers, there is no proof that Naerys was ever unfaithful to Aegon.","Sure, but in the mod Daeron's real father is indeed Aemon, so it's my headcannon.

PS, plus, Daeron the Good was nothing like his father, he was more like his uncle Aemon, so it also makes sense to me that he got his genes if Daeron was indeed Aemon's child.

PPS, also, Genes matter quite a lot, trust me, eventually sons in one way or another end up like their father. not always the case of course, personality wise i am quite different from both my Father & Grandfather, but i have their hot Temper & Strenght. (IRL) so i believe Genes are quite important, it's a huge part of this mod for me. (I play with Congenital Submods like Congenital Overhaul & Improved Genetics)","Lots of people aren't like their fathers and have difficult relationships with them? That's not in itself evidence that Aegon was not Daeron's father. Also, as far as we know, both Aemon and Naerys were extremely religious people, and Aemon took his vows seriously enough to die for the brother he hated. I think it's much more likely that Aemon and Naerys had an emotional affair very much in the style of the knight and his fair lady trope, but never actually got physical or even truly acknowledged themselves as being in any way unfaithful.","Sure, but it makes sense to me that Martin would intentionally do this, it makes things more interesting. after all this is the reason why ASOIAF universe is so popular. there are so many plot holes and G.R.R.M doesn't acknowledge them for a reason, everyone has their own headcannons when it comes to this universe, none of what we think is actually a fact unless G.R.R.M himself has stated that it is. it's why Headcanons exist, you believe something until it is proven wrong, then it becomes Canon.","Europe, 1914, colorized",Do you want an all out civil war? Because that might be kinda fun.,It's Habsburg time.,Was it still really that closely related even 100 years ago?,It’s Habsburg jaw time,"Yes, very much so. On the quick i found the following family tree- Though there are doubtlessly far better sources and explanations. World War One is sometimes called a family feud which went out of hand. Basically Queen Victoria had 9 Children, who married into the royal houses of prussia, russia, denmark and various smaller states.

https://wwiaq.podbean.com/e/family-feud-of-world-war-one/","Really there's Wilhelm II his first cousin was George V's an his cousin was Nicholas II an he was also a first cousin of King Constantine I of Greece.
Wilhelm was shocked at George not being in control of his parliament.","Its so strange to think that this wasn't long ago at all.

What does that mean?","I tried to find the post, but someone made a post about updating the portraits, age, stats and a slew of other things about House Forrester and Whitehill.

**Ranks** could be(From highest ranking to lowest ranking);

Golden Company Representative

Friend of Blackfyres

Trusted Associate

Lowest rank could be; Newcomer, volunteer, novitiate, etc.

**Missions could be;**

Kidnap and torture minor Targaryen.

Murder minor Targaryen.

Sabotage King's Landing/Dragonstone

Murder strong Targaryen supporter

For something similar to the devil worshipper's 'Smash up Church' mission, there could be a ""Destroy Targaryen recruitment post/tax collector's office"" which could add a negative modifier to tax/levy recruitment.

**Graphics** don't have to be something silly, like a massive red cloak. I saw someone mention (if it's possible) to just do a small blackfyre sigil in the top corner of the portrait. 

I'm not really too certain about what interactions with the other systems you are talking about, if you provide more info on it I could brainstorm some stuff.

Quick edit: OP posted another pic earlier in the child's cycle where the child has the Lustful trait, which he's gotten rid of by age 15.

Giant and strong are from the crakehall bloodline, both parents are attractive (Very common trait in our family), dad was quick so yes, I did luck out on genetics, but I didn't console it.

As for the other traits, the Grand Maester had really good traits and taught all my kids well (Patient is one of the traits you can get out of it), I took the conscientius childhood focus, which can give you either diligent or temperate (I chose diligent).

As for brave, that's also a common trait in our family he just learned it off his dad. Can't explain Cynical though.

Formidable fighter came from his uncle ""The Strong Seahorse""'s training (Best way to get it).

I wanna know how they figured out she was all that shit, if she was dead. Like honestly Did they test it in the 2 seconds she was alive?","R5: As Yohn ""the Bronze"" Royce I married my son Andar to Daenerys Targaryen, angering King Robert Baratheon - and he called for her head. No one tells me what to do. The Runestone War for Princess Daenerys's claim on the Iron Throne began. At the Battle of the Vale my forces were met by the Baratheon army headed by Robert. In the midst of battle I was separated from my men. As the plumes of smoke danced before me I saw a familiar crown emerge, the antlers resting atop it glistening menacingly in the sunlight. There stood Robert Baratheon. I beat the hilt of my sword against my bronze armor and stepped closer toward the king...but the Iron Throne's most storied kingsguard stepped between us. Barristan Selmy pushed his king back and readied to face me. While it pained me greatly, Barristan fell to my sword. I stepped over the crumpled body hidden beneath the bloodied white cloak. Now nothing stood between me and the king. Fueled by the battle cries that rained down around us I raised my sword and Robert his warhammer...",he groans after his head is severed from his body?,The great sword to the chest was probably unnecessary after the decapitation.,"Would be nice if you name Andar's son Rhaegar Royce, sounds cool.","Damn, do you stand any chance of winning the war?","What gives you ""the bronze""?",How do you intend to win this war? any allies?,Barristan also gets -20 opinion of the guy who killed him lmao,"I had to read that a couple times too... Maybe just not written well, but I believe that line simply means that Yohn moved in closer to get a more critical shot on Barristan. He doesn't actually ""sever his head from his body"", it's just another way of saying kill him.

Basically the head part is just flavor text and it's more likely trying to convey the following: ""...but I force my way through \[his defences\] and move \[in\] to \[have a better shot at critically wounding him\]."" The killing blow is obviously greatsword through the chest.

EDIT - here you go from OPs other post, same event, slightly different text for that one sentence - [https://i.redd.it/g2673g2q8md31.jpg](https://i.redd.it/g2673g2q8md31.jpg) \- They should have focused less on that setence and more on the killing blow sentence that follows, perhaps (or maybe that can be random too).",Don’t question science. Haha,It’s the “double-tap” rule. Can never be too sure the greatest swordsman in the world is dead.,Ohh I like that. Was thinking Rolls Royce but yours is better.,"Not likely, from what I gather, the North, the Vale and the Riverlands stand with the king. Probably the Stormlands as well.","Yeah what GuessWho2727 said, despite being betrothed to Sansa Stark myself, and marrying my daughter to Robb I couldn’t get Eddard’s alliance in time and so the North is against me. The Trident followed the North’s choice, and Renly Baratheon controlled Stormlands sided with his brother. I married my second son to Margery Tyrell so Mace the Ace joined me, and Dorne joined me as well. Things looked relatively balanced in the opening stages of war but then little Robert Arryn was deposed by Harrold Arryn, and the Vale, who was staying neutral to this point, sided with the Iron Throne (probably the safe choice). Some sellsword hedgeknights joined me as well when the crown failed to pay their war wages - but their numbers are inconsequential. The killer was the Westerlands. Before the war broke out Tywin was imprisoned by Robert Baratheon for an unknown reason, and I tried desperately to plot to free him from prison because I knew his hatred of Robert would be my gain, however, Tywin died in the dungeons and the new LP Tyrion chose to side with his nephew, Joffrey, after I killed Robert in battle. This war within the war is what makes this game so much fun. Now I’m battling to gain the allegiance of smaller houses...but the Iron Throne is definitely winning both of these wars at this point. I’ll post the conclusion.",His nickname is 'Bronze' Yohn in the books. Probably comes from the ancient bronze armour of the Royces.,Exactly right. They always throw in a line of intent but then deliver how the death actually occurs. I move to sever his head from his body...but actually killed him with a sword through the chest (is how I interpret that).,"You have made Targaryen restoration so at least some of your next Royce kings should have Targaryen names, some Aegon Royce or Baelor Royce later would be nice, but king Yohn Royce after Rhaegar would be good too.",If he captures Robert in that duel the war is over and won though,"Good luck! I remember a game where I had an easily winnable war against the Royces, but Yohn absolutely trashed me in several key battles.

Both Val and Ygritte ended up dying under suspicious circumstances, Val while she was fabricating a claim for me and Ygritte I'm guessing was either killed by my wife Cersei or my remaining paramour Tyene.

","Only took me about a week of my life that I won't get back. 

Started as custom Bittersteel ruler of Elyria. Only cheat used was to give myself a dragon egg at the start of the game and to colonize some useless provinces right before I took this photo for aesthetics. 

I did this by exploiting how OP the Empire of Leng is. Seriously, check it out for yourself. Every castle and province there can build a +5 tax gold mine, its small enough that you can hold the entirety of the island as your personal demense, and it has like 50k soldiers for you to raise. Ridiculous, just have to rename it and give new fantasy names for its provinces.

After I took that island and let my dragon grow a bit I took the empire of Yi Ti (which I renamed The East and eventually Essos). Manifest Destinyed the Yi Ti and replaced them with the second sons of the cooler westorosi lords(House Dustin's coat of arms, am I right?). I then played a few generations of the Dragon Lords of the East, before taking Ghiscar, North Valyria, and Sothoros. Decided to blob a few generations later to take over New Valyria, subjugated the horse lords and the remaining independents and Viola!, the Empire of Essos with its 700,000 soldiers and infinite gold. 

Nothing to really do with this campaign anymore, since I'm married to the last Targaryen girl, and the only independent countries left are the Iron Throne and the Kingdom of the Summer Islands, which is already held by a member of my dynasty. Probably just revert back to the save before I conquered outside of Leng and convert to the Drowned God so I can terrorize the rest of the world. 

","1.) Come back when you do it without dragons.

2.) I want to do this sooo bad.","pfffff, come back when you take westeros, then we willl talk","Have you ever heard of your personal lord and saviour Gogossos? Seven holdings and the extremely good Sothoryos buildings will give you a ton of taxes (21 base tax and 45 trade value for every city, 18 base tax and 45 trade value for every castle) and allow you to project force everywhere. If you manage to play as a noble republic (considering that those nowadays play way better than in previous patches) you are set with an extremely strong demense. One, which can only be assaulted by dragons.","Yeah dragons are OP as fuck, but like how are you supposed to get conquest casus bellis without being a pirate or something? Especially for the republics that ypu cant marry into?",""">""implying the Iron Throne isn't a paper tiger that can be taken with a 5k army and a 7 year old dragon.

","Also Dont forget to restore Gogossos to its glory, Worship Valyria god and grab yourself some artifacts.","Iirc the expand realm ambition is available to characters without dragons that have the ambitious trait.

You can use it to conquer kingdom-tier or empire-tier titles (ie like how Daeron the Young Dragon invaded Dorne) in a single war.

However, it is restricted to one use per ruler. That + random fabricated claims + pushing courtier claims should be able to get you somewhere.

Also, it might be a little gamey, but I always edit the game files so that religions can intermarry (ie R'llor and the Seven, or Valyrian and Ghiscari, etc).","I've never seen the LP's support a claimant who did not follow a Westerosi religion (except for the Otherys fucks from Braavos, but I usually dagger their eyes out before the first year is over).",Are there more events or artifacts in Gogossos if you follow valyrian gods? ,"> Also, it might be a little gamey, but I always edit the game files so that religions can intermarry (ie R'llor and the Seven, or Valyrian and Ghiscari, etc).

How would I go about doing this? The religion file under The Seven has:

""intermarry = old_gods""

Would I just add a line underneath that for the Drowned God etc? And if so, would I have to do that to the recipricating group? 

Building on that, let's say I want the Westorsi lords to be able to marry into most of the religions in the Free Cities; if I say ""Okay, the Seven followers can marry these groups, but I don't want lords in Essos marrying those of The Seven/Old Gods"". Would that be possible? ","No, Just a throw-back on how they used to be run by Valyrian.",There is a game-rule to allow free intermarriages between religions though. As long as you are fine with everybody marrying everybody that's a much simpler way than editing files.,There is a game-rule to allow free intermarriages between religions though. As long as you are fine with everybody marrying everybody that's a much simpler way than editing files.,"Yes, though you have to have both religions mutually agree to intermarry. For example, the Drowned Gods would have to have ""intermarry = the_seven"", AND the Seven would have to have ""intermarry = drowned_gods"" (or whatever the Drowned Gods tag is).

The intermarry command determines if characters of one religion can propose/accept proposals from characters of the other religion. 

That is to say, if you only allow The Seven to intermarry with Rhllor, then Rhllor characters will still reject your proposals (you'd only be allowed to marry Rhllor characters in your court). However if you use the intermarry command for both, Westerosi will marry Rhllor.

What you're asking is pretty impossible in the current game, but in the past I've never noticed Westerosi marrying into Essos often. Maybe 10-20 lords will do it every generation.","There are so many rules, I must have overlooked it.",Well that's nice =),"Tyrion:(Entering Tywins solar) ""I just heard the news. So Cersei's dead?""

So even though they don't have direct knowledge about Aegon, others aside from Tyrion are aware of a Targaryen pretender they are presuming to be Rhaegar's son.",Tarly makes sense. Usually he is the first guy to fight but he is too dismissive about this invasion.,Those are two big targets that should defect about as often as Doran joins Aegon.

Here is who they are:

**Aegon Targaryen**: THE Aegon Targaryen. Invaded, was defeated by a grown Joffrey, spent some time in exile, and was eventually crowned by a Great Council after King Jon and Lord Paramount Bran Stark declared an independent North again.

**Jon Stark-Targaryen**: Obviously the secret heir of Rhaegar. He was legitimized by Mance Rayder (see below), and eventually inherited Winterfell after Robb was executed. Later installed as King in the North, and legitimized himself.

**Willas Targaryen**: The only son of Daenaerys Targaryen... and Willas Tyrell. Yes, Dany married Willas. He married his sister and invaded, and later deposed King Aegon VI who was still reeling after a massive loss against King Jon.

So, I started this game as Mance Rayder and tore down the wall, reformed the wildling religion (with a little help from the console), and invaded the Last Hearth and Karhold. I executed Joffrey and a few other notable Lords from the main story (like Cersei and Jeor, some more legitimate than others). Instead of executing Jon, I made him a legit Stark (console) and married him to Ygritte. They had one son before she died, and Jon was made Lord of Winterfell by inheritance. 

After executing Robb and his one year old daughter, Joffrey named Tyrion Lord of the North. Tyrion could not hold the North and ended up getting Tommen, Joffrey, and Joffrey's sons either castrated or executed (The Starks send their regards). In the end, the Dreadfort rose up to install Jon as Lord Paramount. 

I finished sacking the Last Hearth and Karhold as Mance, and switched to Jon, and declared independence from there. I won fairly easily and then turned my attention North and switched back to Mance after reconquering Karhold and the Last Hearth. I had Mance swear fealty to me and I ruled as King of the North and Beyond the Wall. 

Bran inherited the Riverlands after Edumure died against Mance, but Bran was still under Lannister rule. He fought against King Tywin (Iron Throne was on seniority succession) and ended up defeating him, ruled briefly as Lord Protector until a Great Council could be called, and eventually crowned Aegon.

Dany's Tyrell babies were Tyrells.. so I edited the save file to make them Targs, then I married them to one another. A couple of years later (with the help of giving them good stats), Willas Targaryen invaded and deposed Aegon. I let this happen since I support the theory that Aegon from the books is a Blackfyre, or at worst, a nobody.","That looks interesting, Willas looks sick, not the guy i'd wanna go up against. I barely play games in Newer bookmarks, nor do i play Targaryens, but i like seeing other people playing as them. i prefer playing as Lesser houses and turning them into High Valyrians. (though they gotta make sense, like Vances, Qoherys, Pre-Conquest Baratheons, etc. it'd be weird if i just turned Reynes into High Valyrians)","This is nice, gotta love this game","How do you have the quartered banner?

During his travel, he hear rumours of a old hermit capable of teaching dragon taming. And bam!!! You come home with a dragon and being high valyrian you sack the rock.","There is an event for Jon Snow based on a popular theory in the books: Jon Snow is the son and true heir of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark. This gives Jon an event chain where, if he becomes a holder of an king (empire) title, he can either legitimize himself as a Stark, Targaryen, or a fusion of both houses, Stark-Targaryen. The quartered banner is the last Stark-Targaryen House banner.

There are also other banners like this, for example Joffrey can combine the Baratheon and Lannister sigils by proclaiming himself Baratheon-Lannister instead of just Baratheon or just Lannister.","Honor both houses event as Jon after Legalize parentage decision

Hopefully I can finally get Holy fury soon lol","The new Reformation looks fantastic, but there will be a game rule to restrict the Reformation? I would like that, as there is an option in vanilla, to have an option that limits the Reformation to a canonic one. For example, no God-Kings to the Old Gods, or some weights to decisions made by the AI, if Euron (or an ruthless, cynic or ambitious character like him) manages to reform the Drowned God religion, he can do all sorts of craziness, if it is an ruler with the craven trait and low martial skill he can reform the religion in a less belligerant one.",Valyrian stuff!!!,Can’t wait to try all of these new combinations!,"Just yesterday I was googling for a mod that readded religious reformation to ASOIAF religions!

Plz unlock the vanilla grand holy war system plz!!","I actually had the exact opposite thought, where it’s the most reasonable to be a God-King in the old gods with warging and green dreams. Most of the other religions have a god head, where the old gods essentially worship trees/nature and at the core is magic. Not to mention a lot of the original first men- old god believing kings of Westeros claimed to be some sort of descendants  from mythical creatures. 

Personally, I like the idea of having a Reformation where I bring magic and knighthood to the forefront of the Old Gods. But I think God-Kings who are essentially super wargs/other like beings would make sense.",There probably should be one slot of each reforming religion locked into an aspect they have to keep.  For example if you reform the Bravosi religion you have to have anti-slaver locked in as a trait.  Another example being Divine Marriages being locked into Valyrian.,"Rh'llor has a head of religion though, doesn't that mean it can't be reformed?","It think its good for gameplay with other religions that is almost certain that we won't receive much more information about, like the far east ones.

And the faith still can be improved with the lore in the future.",I mean it's a mod so gameplay is paramount at the end of the day.

I did a Euron game where I wanted to tame a dragon, and I had no idea how exactly it worked. So I sailed to Mereen with Euron and Victarion and no real plan (I thought Dragonbinder would work, but apparently it doesn't as long as Dany is alive).

I raided Mereen, then Dany's vastly superior army marched upon me... When she reached me, Victarion apparently did an event where he got a dragon and he killed Dany and Drogon in a dragon fight. After that, I could easily get the 2nd dragon using Dragonbinder, so taking the Iron Throne was easy.

In that game Victarion was made Lord Paramount of the Iron Isles by me, he became Azor Ahai, and he lived until like 90 years old.

Since I wanted Euron's heir to be a half-Targaryen, I had to wait until fAegon's daughter became of age and then marry her. When Euron died, the heir was around 10 years old, so Victarion declared a rebellion and took the throne.

The best thing to do is take one of Dany’s dragons when she dies. Then you can literally pirate raid anywhere and everywhere. Combine that with slave trade and you’re rolling in gold. Can also dragon claim/pirate invade anywhere. Conquer lands then eventually renounce piracy and forge your own empire. 

Right now Im going to take Elyria then push to create New Valyria in Essos.","Damn right. Playing as Aurane was probably the most intoxicatingly fun playthrough I've had. I don't think any other character (in the book timeline at least) offers this much freedom from the very start. All that is required of you is to conquer the remaining Stepstones and afterwards, as OP described, it's just free real estate. Of course, with no restrictions as to who you can conquer or raid, you can amass ridiculous wealth and armies in very short notice, basically making the game trivially easy. Still, right up until the point where it gets boring, it's one of the most fun playthroughs you can have.   


In my own Aurane playthrough I had decided from the start that I would not conquer anything in the mainland of the Seven Kingdoms. All I did was take Dragonstone and Driftmark from Stannis, while leaving the Iron Throne to the squabbling mainlanders. I occasionally singled out and raided coastal Westerosi territories (taking care to target those who were rebelling or otherwise independant, or supporting doomed causes (sorry, Stannis), but for conquest, I turned to Essos. I amassed large slave armies and pecked at the territory of Lys and Tyrosh (who also helped me greatly by being at war with one another, so they wouldn't unite), eventually conquering both of them. Meanwhile, in the Seven Kingdoms, the Others basically destroyed the North, while King Tommen's forces, greatly diminished from the wars against Stannis and Aegon, unsuccessfully tried to hold back the undead tide. At the same time, on the other side of the world, Daenerys succeeded in taking over the entirety of Slaver's bay, advancing on Volantis next. At this point I had taken both Lys and Tyrosh and founded an Empire. Seeing how Daenerys' next targets in her event chain would have been Lys and Tyrosh, plus, I was like the number 1 slaver of the world right now, I actually started worrying that she would come for me next and reduce my new Empire to ash with dragons, and yet, somehow, she lost the war with Volantis and ended up being deposed of her Kingdom... after which she promptly flew over mine and attacked Tommen, easily taking the Iron Throne from him. She then beat back the White Walkers, but managed to get herself killed in the process and her only child, a son sired by none other than Archibald ""Big man"" Yronwood, inherited, and promptly got deposed in favor of some pretender or another, I forgot which it was. At this point it was my dream to tame one of Daenerys' dragons and conquer the remaining Free Cities, establishing the Empire of New Valyria in all its glory. And yet, to my great dismay, I discovered that the ""face the dragon"" event was bugged and wouldn't work no matter what I tried. That was where I, sadly, lost interest in my playthrough and shortly afterwards, updated the mod so the save would not be available anymore. Still, it was immensely fun while it lasted and it's only one of the many examples of what you can easily do within not even half-a-lifetime as Aurane (he was only about 40 when I ended).","Is Lady of the Waves from a DLC or submod ? As I have never heard of it before

And can’t a dragon only be claimed if Dany is dead? I guess Red god conversion is for the taming bonus?",Thanks for the suggestion. I’ve never even thought about trying him,"If you don’t legitimize yourself, do you get to be one of the premade cadet branches of house velayron?","Disagree. To me, Euron isn't even fun. Starts off as king of the united Iron Isles, has dragonbinder which guarantees you'll tame the dragon, an overpowered valyrian steel suit of armor, etc. He's also way older than Aurane and lacks legitimate children. What's the challenge? Surviving your family members who want to remove you? You start off at war with the Reach and trying to conquer them, ok, I guess you've gotta do that now. Ironborn don't have the flexibility that pirates do. Aurane can attack anyone.

Mind you, like yourself my flair is House Greyjoy. Love the character, I just don't enjoy playing as Euron very much. When I play Ironborn, I go House Volmark, House Farwynd or House Blacktyde.","Do you have to be independent to do lots of random conquering as ironborn ?

I seriously wouldn’t recommend this.  AI lords tend to go ham with it.  Within 50 years, almost no OG house holds their ancestral sword. 

Instead, just do the pirate thing and raid.  If you’re pillaging a county where a Valyrian sword holder resides (even in court), you’ll usually get an event to duel them for possession of said sword.","Cadet houses from major houses get custom CoAs that are pretty cool.

I get what you’re saying, but the point of melting down Ice was to show how much that is *not* the norm in Westeros.  It’s extremely uncommon for anyone to do such a thing, and it’s socially unfavorable.

By all means, play as you wish.  But for me, it’s rather immersion breaking when a small lordling or randomly generated house somehow ends up with half a dozen Valyrian swords within one or two generations.  If the rule only applied to the player, it wouldn’t be an issue.  But, as is often in CK II, the AI doesn’t understand the meaning of “restraint.”","It's basically the same as pirate except without the -50 relations with all non-pirates, you're also able to be a feudal kingdom instead of being stuck with the pirate ship government type that won't accept heirs that have low martial stats.","If someone steals your ancestral VS sword, you and your successors get a casus belli against them to take it back... like the Reynes can always attack the Ironborn to get Red Rain back should they choose to.

If you take Ice from a Stark, the Starks 100 years down the line will have the ability to declare a war to take it back if they so choose to.","Yep, it's feudal with all the benefits of piracy and none of the draw backs (you get the pirate base building but also all your normal feudal ones, you can always raid, and you get coastal duchy conquest).","Yes the CB is solid, and it can still be used under normal game conditions.

Rhaegar 'the Righteous,' (posted about in the last few days [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/a458an/the_trials_of_rhaegar/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/a4erqj/rhaegar_the_righteous_back_at_it_again/)), being an incredibly pious king, has no choice but to imprison his own brother, Aerys 'the Arrogant' of Harrenhal after his excommunication. Aerys demands a Trial by Seven, the likes of which haven't been seen in two hundred and fifty years. As is tradition, the Kingsguard stand for the King, but Aerys must spend the next month coming up with champions of his own.

After a month has passed, both sets of seven meet outside of the walls of King's Landing. Standing for King Rhaegar are six of his Kingsguard, with Ser Dale Wendwater filling in for the only absentee. Aerys has procured for himself a far more diverse seven, with some notable inclusions. Fighting for the Lord of Harrenhal are three men looking to make a name for themselves -- Ronnel Norcross, Samwell Lorch, and Halys Locke. In addition to these is Lucas Tyrell, the man who killed King Aegon VI -- the father of both Rhaegar and Aerys -- three decades earlier. To round it out there is Aerys himself, his son and heir Aegon, and then the most shocking combatant of all: Rhaegar's own heir, Prince Aegon had been raised by his uncle Aerys as a page and squire, and felt obliged to fight for the man. With the teams set, the fighting would begin.

The initial charge from horseback was devastating. Aerys and his son Aegon unseated Alaric Plumm of the Kingsguard and Dale Wendwater immediately. Of the Kingsguard, Lucias Chambers' lance found its mark and killed Samwell Lorch immediately. On the ground, the fighting grew more intense. Aerys Targaryen would begin by dueling the young Ronnel Blackwood, handily defeating him after a short while. In contrast, the experienced Lucias Chambers took down the Northman, Halys Locke, with similar ease. Within only a few minutes, the King's champions found themselves on the back foot, with only four of their own left to contend with Aerys' five.

Things would only continue to get worse for the Kingsguard when Prince Aegon took up his sword against them. The King had ensured that, in service to the gods, the Kingsguard were not beholden to their oaths to bring no harm upon those of royal blood, even the Prince of Dragonstone. However, this did not matter much. The young Prince Aegon killed Lucias Chambers and then set about forcing Ben Hightower to yield to him. While Aerys still had his five champions, the Kingsguard had been reduced to two. It is in these moments that Ser Bradamar would earn his nickname, Bradamar 'the Brave.' Bradamar took up a fight against Aerys' son Aegon and Ronnel Norcross at the same time. After quickly killing Ronnel, Bradamar eventually forced the young heir to Harrenhal to submit. Next, Bradamar would face Lucas Tyrell, the Kingslayer, and brought him some semblance of revenge.

Thanks to the actions of Bradamar alone, the odds had flipped in favour of the King. While Bradamar had occupied Aegon, Ronnel, and Lucas, Lord Commander Gendry Waters had been fending off the joint assaults of Aerys and Prince Aegon. In a fight that would no doubt live for eternity in legends, the aged Lord Commander threw aside Prince Aegon and brought the Lord of Harrenhal down at last, forcing him to yield. With the submission of the accused secured, the fight was over. The guilt of Aerys Targaryen had been affirmed, and his surrender was perhaps all that saved his and the young prince's life. When all had settled, three men were left dead in the sands, and only two stood triumphantly at all. It would come time for King Rhaegar to pass his judgement on his brother.

However, unbeknownst to all, Rhaegar had been whisked away from the fight, his prolonged sickness (that had many months ago cost him his eye) flaring up due to the stress of the battle. It would only take minutes for the king to pass, thus ending a glorious and peaceful thirty-year reign.Having begun the battle as a prince, Aegon found himself only minutes later ending it as a king, and a defeated one at that. Nevertheless, his first act as Aegon VII would be to ratify the will of the gods, condemning his favoured uncle to the Wall for his crimes. However, within weeks, word would soon reach the capital that Aerys Targaryen had never been received at Castle Black, leading many to wonder as to the whereabouts of a man who no doubt harbours a great deal of anger towards the crown.","This is awesome, just the kind of mad chaos i'd expect from westeros

I actually tried my hand at that once, but eventually gave up not long after the main mod updated for Monks and Mystics while I was still working on it. 

I did write a bit of lore for it though, like Elia being burned by Aerys at the end of the Rebellion and Aerys being still killed by Jaime (Who goes on to join the Nights Watch and eventually becomes Lord Commander), Stannis ruling the Stormlands, Lyanna still dying giving birth to Jon (now named Aemon), and Cersei being married to Rhaegar and the mother of three of his children: Visenya, Daeron, and Daemon. Had this whole idea about including a starting event that was basically Rhaegar dying and a three-way Second Dance of Dragons breaking out, with Aegon VI (married to Rhaenys and Visenya) leading the Stormlands, Cownlands, and Dorne, Aemon I (married to Daenerys) leading the North, Riverlands, and the Vale, and Daeron III (married to Margaery) leading the Westerlands and the Reach.

Each ruler brings new challenges controlling your LPs and if you do a marriage alliance by marrying off a princess it means dealing with the children of that union almost always plotting to take the throne.

My challenges typically involve trying to secure Targaryen rule even in the event of a major uprising.  I'll do this by either working to make a Targaryen branch rule a LP position and by taking high levy counties like Tyrosh or Sothoryos.

That was pretty normal, he won quite a few dragon duels and won the war, but it got real interesting when he died. 

After his death, his son Aegon VII became King, but he already had a dragon, one he hatched a few years before. He ruled for about 20 years, but Odikagon remained unclaimed until he was tamed by Viserra Velaryon, who tried to press her claim on the Iron Throne. Not long after those two fought a duel, and Aegon VII was killed by his father's own dragon, leaving the throne to his young son Viserys. I think a total of like 4 Targaryens died trying to duel Odikagon, until eventually Viserys killed it with his own dragon, winning the war.","Yeah at first it was difficult and I had to marry some non-valyrians early game for alliances and whatnot, but by now I have 5 healthy cadet dynasties, Houses Velaryon and Celtigar, and some other various families with the Valyrian look so now there is no shortage of brides for whenever I have to marry a son or brother off","Not entirely as Essos is still a mess, but there were a few Essosi conquests under various Kings. Gaemon I conquered the stepstones and his son Gaemon II fought quite a few embargo wars. After that his son Gaemon III reclaimed Andalos itself. After that the Free Cities were fighting among eachother until Haegon the Victorious sacked Lys and conquered the City. All three of these areas now do follow The Seven due to conversion, though Lys is still a duchy-level merchant republic while Andalos and the Steptones are ruled by Houses Manderely and Evelion as Lords Paramount.","For submods I have a few like Bloodlines, Congenital Overhaul, Strong Seed and a few others like Bye Far East. I might make an AAR when the save finally stops being able to play since people seem to be pretty interested, but for now heres the Great House list!

Current Houses:

* House Targaryen - The Kings of course, not much to explain here

* House Tyrell - One of the three remaining original Great Houses, House Tyrell has been pretty stable for the whole time, never once losing it's seat or rebelling against the throne, so the Reach is overwhelmingly stable.

* House Goldfyre - After House Lannister's last male lord died the throne passed back to the crown. King Jacaerys gave the Westlands to his second son, Daeron the Eagle, who was then wed to Jeyne Lannister, taking the name Goldfyre. They have not only dragons, but also the wealth of the Gold Mines of the Westerlands. So while they aren't the oldest cadet line, they are the strongest.

* House Redwyne (of the Trident) - The Riverlands were originally under the domain of a Stark branch but after they died out the Crown would see fit to name a second son of House Redwyne as Lord Paramount since the Redwynes would have no local power base aside from Riverrun itself, and thus they'd be pretty incapable of threatening the throne. Right now King Valarr II is rivals with the current Redwyne Lord in Riverrun though, so the Lord Paramount title could be shifted to a different House in the near future depending on if the title is revoked in the future.

* House Arryn - Perhaps even more unchanged than House Tyrell, the Arryns have also maintained their hold on the vale and have become quite the loyalists over the years, with several Hands and Queen-Consorts being Arryns.

* House Evelion - Founded after Gaemon the Warrior conquered the stepstones, this house is relatively minor compared to the other Lord Paramounts since the Stepstones are poor and the Evelions are a very young house. Despite this, they are stable too.

* House Codd - Granted the Iron Islands after House Greyjoy died out, the Codds are a weird bunch. At some point they married a Targaryen Princess and because House Codd has divine blood abilities, they have maintained the Valyrian look for over 100 years at this point. This includes Dragons too, so they have an easy time keeping their hold on the Isles. The Current Lord is the Grandfather of King Valarr II, and the Codd's conversion to the Seven has almost eliminated the Drowned God's faithful in the Iron Islands in the last 50 years.

* House Icefyre - Similarly to House Lannister's successor, the Icefyres are the oldest Targaryen cadet branch who were granted Winterfell/The North after House Stark ended. In a similar situation, the King's second son (and child of Argelle Stark, the last living Stark) similarly was given the region to start the oldest of the Targaryen cadet branches. Similar in power to the Goldfyres, if House Targaryen were to die out then there would surely be a second Dance between the two families.

* House Baratheon - The Baratheons have been pretty quiet this game, but their allegiance to the Targaryens has been renewed a few times through quite a few royal marriages, but even to this day they still have their black hair and blue eyes despite all the valyrian marriages.

* House Manderly (of Andalos) - A secondary branch of House Manderely of White Harbor, the Manderlys were granted Andalos after Gaemon III's war for the Seven's holy land. With the lands of Hugor of the Hill now under faithful rule again, Lord Manderly was given the title by Gaemon III on his deathbed as a way to keep the peace with the Starks/Greyjoys who might have felt threatened by the militarized spreading of the Seven.

Notably excluded are Dorne (the king inherited it through marriage so there are still a few Martells around, but they don't have any titles right now) and Beyond-The-Wall. Both of these regions have elective monarchies, so the top-level title is constantly in flux between the Bannermen. Right now Dorne is ruled by House Uller, and Beyond-the-Wall is ruled by the wildling Casey Icebane.","Not that I know of, I have some retinues up there though so any rebellion they have gets crushed in about a month or so anyway.","The way I set this one up is that rather than it just be Rhaegar winning on the Trident, instead the premise is that Aerys doesn't attend the tourney of Harrenhal. This lets Rhaegar plot like he planned with Great Lords and others who might have been scared off by Aerys unexpectedly attending like he did in canon, so Rhaegar instead gets wrapped up in Rickard's Southron Ambitions. This means he has the support of House Stark  through Rickard, House Arryn through Jon Arryn who had been fostering Ned and Robert, and House Tyrell since they like Rhaegar alot more than Aerys and want to benefit from when Rhaegar becomes king. So instead of Robert's Rebellion you get Rhaegar's Rebellion, but he still has a few obstacles; He's still going after Lyanna so Robert is still pissed at him and not really willing to help, Tywin is still Hand of the King since Aerys never named Jaime to the Kingsguard at Harrenhal, and Dorne is neutral for the moment since they are worried that Rhaegar intends to remove Elia's children from the succession if he takes a new wife. 

Now I haven't written the battles summary yet, but i can give a general overview of this war. In the end there is no coup since Rhaegar is found out by Varys after he heads North to rally an Army, so Aerys starts the war by disinheriting Rhaegar (and his children) and naming Viserys the new heir. Now Tywin is onboard again since there is a real chance of marrying Cersei to Viserys, and some on the fence lords like the Tullys stay Loyalist for the time since Rhaegar seemingly only has the North and Vale to count on. As the war goes on and the Rebels get more victories (and Aerys shows himself to be way crazier than everyone thought, since he never went to Harrenhal so most lords hadn't yet seen how unraveled he was yet) more lords go to Rhaegar's side, who at this point has taken Lyanna as a wife and signs more or less a renewed Pact of Ice and Fire, promising offices, lands and a Targaryen Princess to House Stark. To bring Dorne fully to his side he decress that Aegon will remain his heir ahead of any children he has with Lyanna. House Tully is forced to concede since the Riverlands are hard to defend against two different neighboring Kingdoms; Harrenhal and Esgaroth are made part of the Crownlands, but in return House Tully is untouched itself and the originally planned Stark-Tully and Arryn-Tully marriages go through (Ned still replaces Brandon in the succession but i'm undecided if it's through Brandon dying in previous battles or getting disinherited somehow). Robert originally fights for the Loyalists due to his animosity with Rhaegar, but after losing the Battle of Ashford and retreating to the Riverlands hes forced to choose either fighting Jon Arryn and Ned and their host or switching sides, and in the end Robert too switches for the sake of his best friend and his mentor, even if he still despises Rhargar for taking his betrothed. Now with the Momentum against Aerys, they march on King's Landing. Faced with the combined forces of 4 Great House the gates are thrown open, so while the city isn't brutally sacked Aerys still dies at Jaime's hand (he was named a Kingsguard after Aerys blames Tywin for the war progressing badly) to prevent the city from burning like in canon. Thus Rhaegar takes the throne, but the War leaves the realm divided and unhappy, setting the stage for the wars in ACOK which aren't the canon ones, but i'm not ready to reveal them yet until i finish the actual lore doc.

TL;DR Rhaegar dethrones his dad as he originally planned, but things still aren't well and in 8299 there are alot of lords who want revenge or feel left out ever since the Rebellion and they try to change that.","They are Targaryens so quite a few, but as of recently I've been marrying into the Cadet branches half the time since I need to keep their lords loyal, otherwise they might try to press their claims or use their dragons to wreck the Kingdom.","I did get a dragon egg from colonizing summerhall, but I already had 3 dragons from Daenerys (I started in 8299, the bookmark I used was a custom-modded ACOK scenario going off of the idea of Rhaegar winning the Rebellion and being King, which i'm planning to make into a submod).

As for the Dragonlord and Dragonslayer, they were pretty badass. Jaehaerys the Dragonlord is the alternate version of Jon in this scenario. He was originally named Lord of Summerhall, but after Aegon VI died in the War for the Dawn he inherited the throne. He then reigned for 40 years or so, managing to fight about a dozen wars and outliving his oldest 5 children, before the throne was eventually inherited by his grandson, Daeron. Lucerys the Dragonslayer came quite a bit later, and he got up to so much mischievous nonsense because he inherited Dragonstone from his father, the eldest son of Aemon II, so he ran around as Lord of Dragonstone for about 10 years, during which he slayed a Dragon with Dark Sister giving him an ironic nickname considering his family. Despite his hype nickname he was only King for about a year or so, dying of stress and passing the throne to his son Jaehaerys V.","downgrade back to the 2.8 update, the mod isn't compatible with 3.0","Yeah, I actually prefer long-running gameplay. I love the roleplaying aspect of CK2, and transforming the world into something unique to that playthrough.  But I seem unable to get past the 200 year mark in the mod lately.  There have been one or two playthroughs where I go longer before corruption kicks in. I'd love if there was a way to keep corruption from setting in so quickly.","Same here - 300 years seems to be a hard limit for me.  By then the game is so full of bugs it's hard to keep it together.

By this I mean that duchy/kingdom titles randomly lose their name or get reassigned to randomly created characters, the culture of vassal titles gets jumbled around, and the game crashes every few months.  It becomes a hassle for me to keep playing at that point.  It's happened at least 3 or 4 times for me.","Yes, I find that a strong ruler often leads to a challenging succession to be a major factor in keeping things fresh. 

Sure, your dad had a ton of kids and had a lot of success, but when he dies that just means you have 6 landed brothers (because sons are generally the most loyal sort of vassal) who have claims on the throne and just as much land as you do.

Random chance keeps things fresh too - nothing better than having your 25 year old warrior king die of pneumonia and leaving a 1 year old heir (and is it just me, or are vassals WAY more bold during a regency?)",Need.

Aside from the logical cutting of certain storylines like Lady Stoneheart and Aegon, you're complaining about stuff that could very well happen in the books we'll never see.

",">butchered Stannis’s character 

Hahaha. Stannis would absolutely burn his own if he was desperate enough. Stannis worship needs to end ","- The prince or princess thing was established in the books, both Jon and Dany have been set up as potential end game leaders for a while. I just think it was hint that it could go either way since most fans are banking on Jon. Jon is definitely more selfish and honorable, he is the quintessential hero. On the other hand, there has been a lot time spent showing Dany gain experience in what it means to rule. They both their Pros and Cons. 

- All men must die was from season 3 and it was a nice snarky reply for that moment. 

- I don't really see the problem with the war council. Jon's most prominent advisors(Sam, Davos, Tormund) are mostly male so it evens out. Martin has already killed off a lot of the most prominent male characters in the books so I don't see the war council looking very different in ASOIAF. Mace is unlikely to die but he was only a figure head, Olenna was already  established as the brains behind the family; Euron is a cunt so Asha(Yara) and Theon will still flock to Dany's side, and Arianne will probably represent Dorne in place of the sand snakes. 

- I agree that the  Lyanna Mormont scene was heavy handed but it was only a few minutes out of 7+ hours. I'm a woman so maybe that's why it didn't really bother me?","The Neck is a  s w a m p, and swamps have  t r e e s.

Shows over!","Not your hombre, mon ami.",Uhm... You don't need the books to criticize the show. Tbh I have more respect for George if he just gave up than if he released some half assed story that makes little sense.,Well it was obviously a tragic accident. Not like there's anybody alive who could talk about what really happened. ,[deleted],"So spot on smh, it’s just feminist wish fulfilment. Nothing wrong with feminism, and it’s a present theme in our story, but they’re not using the theme to tell a meaningful story just nonsensically handing power to characters with badly written or non existent flaws","If you haven’t read the books you might not understand why what is happening on the show seems so wild, so I’ll try and give a few examples.

1. Cersei being Queen.

This makes absolutely no sense at all. There is a precedent for males succeeding before females, and the lords of the realm would not accept Cersei as a queen. Besides the fact that house Baratheon officially holds the throne, if all her children were to die there would likely be a great council as we’ve seen from all the history GRRM has presented. Even Kevan Lannister’s male children would have a better claim.

2. Arya and the faceless foolishness

The faceless plot was nonsensical, had no consequences for Arya (eg. gets stabbed... recovers in a day), we had faceless men running around and killing in broad daylight, we had Arya becoming ‘no-one’ in the eyes of the faceless men despite clearly retaining her identity. Like what??

3. The butchering of Stannis Baratheon

Stannis was known throughout the 7 Kingdoms for his skills as a tactician, leading his troops from the rear and making strategic calls. In the books, he will likely lure Roose Bolton’s troops into a trap on the frozen lake, while in the show they made him a hotheaded leader, the first one off the boat leading the charge in the battle of black water, and then to charge at the bolton forces while being hopelessly outmatched.

4. Loras Tyrell’s sexuality being his only character trait.

In the books Loras is portrayed as a hotheaded warrior, he appears to be plotting right from the beginning as he seems to want to make Margaery Queen by having Robert set aside Cersei. But Robert could only set aside Cersei if the incest was found out, leading us to suspect that Loras knew about the incest from the beginning. His sexuality is not overt, you might miss it if you don’t pick up on the small clues. It’s just a piece of his character, not the focus.

5. The overarching themes of GRRM’s work.

This is one that really riles up game of thrones fans, but GRRM’s magnum opus is unlikely to be a ‘good vs evil’ story at all. I doubt the white walkers (the Others as they’re named in the books) are ‘evil’, they’re probably mutated humans suffering from an inbreeding depression.  I also doubt R+L=J is real, as it seems against the spirit of GRRM’s message, that feudalism is bad and violence begets violence. Jon is the saviour of the world because his father (a twenty something year old man) kidnaps and falls ‘in love’ (🤢🤢🤢) with a FOURTEEN year old girl? 

Sorry, another common theme of GRRM’s is that prophecy is bullshit, usually the ploy of enemies trying to get people to turn on and kill eachother.

TL:DR, look at the first sentence of every paragraph and you’ll get the idea.","Im not your mon ami, friendo.","You kind of do when the show was supposed to be a TV adaptation of the books. They didn't sign up to write the end of the series and now they have an impossible task. It's also unfair to criticize show plots that might still play out in the books, for all we know. 

It's not a coincidence that all the GoT backlash started with S6 when the show ran out of book material. You can say you don't like the newer seasons (and I would agree) but GRRM is really the only one that deserves blame for that. ","I don't know, I think Martin is pretty feminist(in a good way) himself. This is guy who has created characters and legends like Arya, Brienne, Nymeria and Rhaenyra Targaryen, etc. 

T","I've read the books but it's been a while.

1. Cersei as queen doesn't make much sense but they were a bit stuck with that. I think the showrunners wanted an endgame ""big bad"" and to condense the size of the cast. It was too late to build anyone else up.

2. Arya' plotline was extremely poor writing and very disappointing. I don't think they knew what to do with that storyline at all. The fact that she ended her faceless man arc with the same personality and seemingly little skill as a faceless man and came back to Westoros as an experienced, cold assassin was shitty, shitty writing but they did the same thing with Bran. All of his difficult character progression happened off screen. They are not great writers but it's also partly Martin's fault. Bran and Arya have difficult arcs to conclude especially when there's so much information missing about how The Faceless Men and Three-eyed Raven works. I don't think there are many writers talented enough to fill in gaps that even Martin is have trouble filling in. 

3.  I'm sure Stannis will meet a similar end in the books but it will be better written. I was never a big fan of his either way.

4. The writing for Loras and the other gay characters is more homophobic and stereotypical than anti-male. They made all of the gay guys a lot more feminine than they are in the books. They even made Yara(Asha) a butch lesbian because a tough chick with short hair couldn't possibly be attracted to men./s I'm surprised they didn't also make Brienne a lesbian. 

5. I'm a believer in R+L=J so I don't really know what to say there but I didn't think it was a ""true love"" thing.  I agree that Martin likes to defy commen narrative tropes and D&D are hacks that can't write a story without them. The sanitization of Tyrion is their worst offense in my opinion. The show has ruined his character arc because show only fans will get pissed off of they see one of their favs commit cold blooded murder and rape underage slave prostitutes.

6. I think the prophecies are more complex than just ""bullshit"". 


I'm not going argue with anyone that says D&D are bad writers, I completely agree. Season 7 was the worst season by far. I just don't think that ""girl power"" is the reason for the decline. I don't think they're ""feminist"" or trying to appeal to ""SJW"", they're just terrible writers that depend on commen tropes to write a story.","I'm not your friendo, comrade.","GRRM is not at fault for low quality writing being pushed out by D&D. They could have taken more time and consulted with more experienced writers but instead they made what I can only describe as a mess. If George releases the same mess then I will criticize it all the same. Right now I'm criticizing the show as a seperate entity as the books, because they are.","I just agreed that GRRM has sympathies for feminism and that ASOIAF is pretty pro-feminism, however the show, UNLIKE the book is not concerned with telling a good story, just one that fulfils the wishes of the viewers.  

Judging by all my downvotes however, I imagine a lot of people don’t like hearing an accurate and fair criticism of the show 🤷🏽‍♂️","I'm not your comrade, guy.","""Low-quality writing"" implies that it could have been done better, and the sad truth is that it couldn't. If Shakespeare spends 30 years writing 4 acts of a brilliant play and hands the script to an amateur playwright to finish, is it his fault when the 5th act sucks? D&D were constrained to the story that GRRM wrote and the production schedule that HBO set, they had no more time and no better consultant than GRRM himself. 

The reality is that without the books, there was never going to be a satisfying conclusion to this series. No producer in their right mind would have taken on this project if they'd read the books and were told they'd have to finish them. You're better off enjoying S8 for what it is - a pretty good TV show - than expecting a fitting conclusion to 3 decades of brilliant world-building and story telling that the author himself can't sort out.   ","I'm not your guy, compañero.","> ""Low-quality writing"" implies that it could have been done better, and the sad truth is that it couldn't.

What the fuck? So D&D is free from criticism because they don't have GRRM holding their hand anymore? These aren't amateur play writers so im not sure how that comparison is even close. 

Ellaria Sand wanted Doran to do something about Oberyn getting killed. Killed in a trial by combat that he willingly entered and didn't try his hardest (by just winning instead of trying to force a confession) and when Doran doesn't want to retaliate (because that would be ridiculous) Ellaria murders him and the rest of his family and nobody cares. Oberyn would be so proud. The timing in the latest season with Gendry running back to the wall in 30 seconds to get a raven to Dany across the continent for help. What do we believe, that they stayed out there on the frozen lake for 2 weeks? Or Gendry can teleport? Its extremely bad writing and nobody needs GRRM to tell them that.

&nbsp;

So my play through is far from over but I will post about it since it has been one of my most interesting game to date and some of interesting bits have already developed.  So Gylbert didn't last long but he was able to get a bit of infrastructure built.  During this time Euron and Victorian both get trampled by the Reach and Westerlands and get imprisoned for life or killed before making any babies.  Asha marries an unknown and all the kids are of his dynasty and she dies soon after and Theon lives out a decent life as my spymaster.  Aeron somehow end up in the service of the Tyrells and inherited Euron's armor  I was hopeful that he would die and the armor pass to Theon but unfortunately he outlived Theon by quite a while and the Tyrell's claimed the armor.  The Greyjoys become the first major family to die out while I go about my summer islands raiding and small time build projects.

&nbsp;

On Westeros, Aegon and Dany joined up and simultaneously conquered all of Westeros, Meereen, Astapor, Yunki, and Gris forming the Empire of Griscar.  For whatever reason Aegon ruled Westeros and Dany ruled The Empire of Griscar and they didnt unify.  Queue the White Walker invasion and the war for the Dawn after the White walker eat Winterfell and everything north of it.  I even saw some White Walker stacks in the riverlands before Aegon beat them.   Dany (Chosen by R'hllor and wielder of Lightbringer) is killed by an assassin early and only has one child with Aegon.  The baby inherits her empire and Aegon promptly takes it from his own true Targaryen daughter and rules both for a while and pops out a few more kids with different women.  The Free Cities are very dynamic at this point, constantly swapping territory and even colonizing along the Rhoyne and into northern Valyria.  Braavos eats Pentos and  Qohor gets reduced to a duchy or two after it over extended itself versus (but for a moment it was impressive) Norvos, Sarnor, and too many colonies.  The Boltons kill each other off after much Northern infighting and Aegon grants the North to the Flints who swap the title back and forth between the different branches.  The Reeds, Manderlys, and Umbers are all killed off in the time period either from the WW invasion or Bolton civil war.  Baelish claims the riverlands but is unable to produce enough healthy heirs to hold it and Aegon gives the riverlands to the Starks.         

&nbsp;

Gen 2 overlaps a bit with the above drama but I am able to stay away from most of it and I was able to get a claim on the summer isle of Koj and invaded.  I am happy to raid, make babies, build up slave camps, and build up Lonely Light.  Back on Westeros Aegon dies after expanding to the Stepstones and leaves both portions of the empire to his not at all Targaryen looking son Laenor which the people of Westeros don't like very much and revolt.  The Baratheons and Edric Storm rule for a time till the throne passes to his son Gawen who is promptly conquered by one of Aegon's bastards riding a dragon.  And Yorka (the bastard) turns into quite the conqueror.  So you once again have two Targaryens each ruling half of the empire.   

&nbsp;

Gen 3 / Current.  The Kingship of the Iron Islands is passed around like a hot potato but after much internal strife it is much weakened beast and I now have around 4k-ish troops and a skilled fighter character so I go Valyrian Sword shopping and decide that Poison and Stranger Mercy really should belong to Farwynd.  I am in heaven.  I have a great Reaving Lord, 2 valyrian swords, and a decently sized army and navy to finally start hitting some high value provinces that are not war ravanged.  This glory time for me had mostly been under a regency for child Iron King ( Each new king would change the succession laws which would queue a revolt which would toss them out).  Once he comes of age he (he must have been flooded with requests to stop me) decides that he doesn't like my reaving ways.  He becomes the bane of my existence even after i marry a sister to him, he constantly demands that I stop attacking Lys, Tyrosh, Myr, Volantis, Qarth, Asshai, and the Iron Throne (apparently the swords I took were not from truly independent lords like I thought).  I take a moment for a breather to chill out and say to myself, ""Don't worry, I can still raid the summer isles and Northern Essos.""  Then the bastard starts naming Summer Isle principalities that I can no longer attack and I go ape shit.  That is the final straw so I refuse and declare war on his ass.  Thankfully his levy was as weak as I had ever seen it for me so with intervention of my goodbrother allies and some mercs we grinded away his armies piecemeal when my character dies.  I thought it was all over but my son came back from the Free Cities where he had joined The Gallent Men as a formidable fighter and I breathe a sigh of relief.  We siege down everything but pyke's insane garrison and it is just enough to claim victory.  I am named Lord Protector till a Kingsmoot is called.  Finally I am hopeful that I am not going to answer to another push over king and I prepare myself to step down.  For whatever reason when the event fires I only have two options, put my nephew by King Asshole on the throne or delay the kingsmoot and name myself King.  I honestly didn't want either of those two options since my own levy was still smaller than most of the other lords and dukes.  I choose the make myself king and piss off the Goodbrothers and several others.  If they are revolted together that would have been the end of me but I was able to buy enough of them off with coin, sisters, and aunts.  Back on Westeros the Lannisters have gotten stupid with their marriages and have lost and reclaimed and lost again the Westerlands.  Currently some skillful moves by the Tyrells put one of there own on that throne.  We will see if they are able to keep it since the Lannisters are still around.  The Starks are having a rough time in the Riverlands and a generation after they lost Longclaw they have died out (I wish I knew where Longclaw went, it is no longer showing up in the sword list in the intrigue menu).  It is kind of poetic, lose the sword lose the family.  Yorka (Aegon's vengeful bastard) somehow lost the Stepstones to Lys but has for the first time ever seen in one of my own campaigns, crossed the narrow sea.  She has taken Braavos (which still included quite a bit of Pentos) and even a few of the basilisk isles.  I am actually scared of her and I am curious how much more she can accomplish at 58 years old and childless.  Laenor is set to inherit from her but Laenor's his only child is blind so can't inherit after him.  That brings me back to the first born daughter of Aegon and Dany and the only and last ""pure"" Targaryen.  She ended up on Shame Isle in the stepstones which she passed to her genius dragon rider son who has remained independent.  Fun fact Shame island has 4 dragons, the most of any other place.  The inheritance bits are about to get crazy if the targs dont start having more babies.  Part of me hopes it all crumbles down only to be rebuilt buy the Shame Island branch.      

&nbsp;         

Interesting oddities
The Karstarks are still alive north of the wall but will be dead in a generation if they don't produce any men or get a matrilineal marriage.  There are a few ironborn north of the wall and another one carved out a county from a crumbling Pentos.  The Vale is somehow independent but it might be a mega war issue that will resolve itself later. Asshai formed its own kingdom. Qarth has conquered half of Faros and colonized the city of Old Gris.  The Baratheons got stupid with their marriages as well the first born son of Edric Storm got into a matrilineal marriage which produced children that are not of the Baratheon line.  Thankfully for them she died and he married again normally and had a son to carry on his name.  However while that son is the current LP of the stormlands at 16 years old he has spent atleast the last 10 years in prison.  I don't seem him making babies anytime soon.  Yorka is also of the R'hllor religion so there might be some interesting religious strife at some point since bits of westeros have converted. ","A hour in already have the Iron Islands????

Well, GG","After roughly 50-55 years of constant reaving and upgrading Lonely Light, Gylbert's grandson, son of Gyles, Gylbert 'the scholar' has now planted roots on mainland Westeros taking Martlet's Bay. The reconstruction of Oldstones began immediately. Gylbert also conquered Sunstone but immediately gave it to his 2nd born son. Gylbert now also wields Truth and Vigilance, taking the house swords of Rogare and Hightower. Along with the swords, Gylbert also keeps the dark book the 'necronomicon' in his treasury which has slowly driven him mad. While Gylbert's heir, Gyles, is already a man in his 50s his grandson Sylas shows extreme promise as a reaver being just 19 and already being a formidable warrior and brilliant strategist. Folks will certainly pray when they see his sails.",Whats the start date?,"Completely new to CK2... and this is my first game, god help.

Gylbert started his poorly planned vision by firstly hiring a new sellsword (lucky enough to get a martial skill of 16) and using him to train his grandson, Gyles, hoping to produce a strong commander and future lord reaver. Whilst Gyles was training, it seemed fitting to start raiding, so off Gylbert set to the Summer Isles with a small troop. From here the majority of isles were raided, bringing in enough coin to start to expand Lonely Light and build a Flagship, which was arrogantly named ""Lord Gylbert"" (a terrifying name). 

After exhausting the summer set isles of any real loot, Gylbert ventured off reaving Essos. Firstly, every single attempt at making any coin on this adventure failed miserably and secondly when Gylbert returned to the Iron Islands he was met with a pretentious and criminal message from the Iron King claiming he must compensate for all the reaving and must not raid Essos for a minimum of 10 years. Gylbert, being the poor idiot he is decided to screw the King and go to war... 

After about a year Gylbert was in prison alongside his entire family being tortured in fun and exciting new ways.

TL;DR Gylbert attempts raiding, appears to be good at it. Gylbert goes reaving, appears awful at it, is told off by the king and then goes to war for independence but is only met with torture and a prison cell. 

Edit: Gylbert was reaving, not reading...","Everybody starts with Lord Gylbert. My Lord Gylbert died June 27th of the very first year after getting scurvy while raiding the Summer Isles. Euron became infirm and was declared incapable after being a tyrant for a few years over myself Lord Gyles. Lord Gyles raided all of Essos and much of the Iron Throne which caused some tension with the king of Iron Isles. That being said Gyles had befriended Asha Greyjoy and she was my choice for the new King. Euron put down several rebellions in the iron island before finally passing and I was made into the interim King. Why? I dunno but fine with me! I used my new found power to finally end a blood feud with the Merlyns of Pebbleton who had been repeatedly trying to claim Lonely Light. Why the hell anyone would want that I do not know but fully 8 Mertyns including the last of their line were sacrificed to the Drowned god. Lord Gyles ""the Able"" was the deciding vote naming Asha Iron Queen. During the transition of power the Lordship of Pyke stayed with Gyles. I am not sure why or how but I was happy to finally have some ships.

Side note: Anyone complaining about a lack of ships for the Farwynds.... after a few raids hire some mercenary ships. They cost almost nothing and as long as you are raiding cleverly you can maintain them FOREVER. With a little money build your shipyards up. 

Gyles raided Ibben, Myr, Pentos, Bravos, Summer Isles, Lys (repeatedly) and all other east landings. Ashai was especially nice to hit as it would raise my slave camp levels. Gyles at this time is a very wealthy man sitting at about 2k gold at any given moment thanks to constant slave trade and raiding! 
Everything is well. Well in the Iron Isles anyway. During Gyles' life the following happenings take place.

Stannis kills Aegon.
Tommen kills Stannis.
MACE TYRELL conquers the Iron Throne and exiles Tommen.
He is the 1st of 7 kings who rule for 45 years.
The Tywin portion of the Lannisters are all killed in various mishaps not of my doing including the young dwarf son of Tyrion.
The wall has fallen.
Jon is dead and was slain by Alliser Thorne in a duel of honour.
Dany commits suicide at age 24 leaving a newborn boy of house Vaesareon or something to be king of Mereen. Heand his line actually successfully rules Mereen his entire life btw. As a slaver haha.
Sansa married Harrold Arryn and they are profligate. I have never seen so many Arryns in any playthrough. At 8371 there are actually multiple north lords named Arryn and most of the rest are Glovers or new nobility.
Rickon lives long and did nothing.
The Starks are dead.
The Boltons all died fighting White Walkers.
WW's also killed off the Wulls, Flints, Umbers, Karstarks, Forresters, Manderlys, and Whitehills. Oddly enough after the WW are defeated by IT King Anslem The Holy (sp?) and the Reeds are now Wildmen north of the wall.

Before the war was won however Asha declared that I could not raid. Pretty much everywhere. Lord Gyles however was an honest and honourable man so he honoured the demand but as this was his main source of income and pride I would assume this would cause much frustration and anger. He is also an old man. During this time of relative peace he gets cancer, becomes horribly disfigured in the face, gains a Valyrian Sword, conquers Grey Shield and Oakenshield for himself when they declare independence during a war. He is a reaver and is feared worldwide. While on a reave with his son Lucas he is severely injured while killing a Bravossi named Margello. He soon dies of these injuries.

Lucas.
Shortly after Lord Gyles the Able died Lucas has his VS reforged into a family heirloom named Father's Fury. I didn't realise how apt a name this would be. Many of my father's enemies declared war for Pyke on Lucas and he slew several members of the Goodbrother and Harlaw houses defeating their Claims to Pyke, as well as slaying a few Greyjoy claimants in single combat. The raiding began again in earnest under Lucas and he took several salt wives from Lys to the Dothraki sea. Lord Gyles was wealthy. Lord Lucas became one of the richest men in Westeros over a period 5 years. At the age of 29 he became Iron King Lucas of the Iron Isles! He rules with an Iron fist and mercilessly raids anywhere there is gold to be found. In his first year as king he becomes known as Iron King Lucas the Evil of the Iron Islands. He has become so popular among the isles that he is soon able to declare the war for the Trident. The trident had won independence successfully with King Edmure the Accursed Tully as it king. A day after the declaration of war Edmure passed of natural Causes. His son King Oswell fell in battle against Lucas the Evi within 2 weeksl. His brother  King Osmund then died of poor health within that month.  Their sister Queen Alyx then died of Winter Fever almost immediately and thus ended the line of Tullys. Lucas followed this up by sacking Harrenhal to capture King Osric of nowhere in particular ""Tower of dread"" or something. Boom. Iron Islands holds the kingdom of trident title.

During this period of war between the Trident and the Iron Isles there was war elsewhere as well. The North, the Vale, and Dorne are all fighting separate wars for independence against the TYRELL IT. I had anticipated the Iron Throne winning these wars and then reclaiming the trident or attempting to. Dorne lost their war against the IT as the armies marched straight for them. Losses for the IT here were apparently massive as soon after they reconquered Dorne the North under House Woods won independence. The Woods house is neat as its emblem is an old weirwood that is half white and red and matches the royal north emblem well. The Vale also won independence. After buying the loyalty of much of the noble houses of the vale, a few titles given here and there, I had enough popularity to declare war on the IT. The great IRON THRONE! They had 17k troops. We won the war in less than 2 months with some unnecessary yet poetic help from the North Woods and the Vale Arryns. After this over the next 10 years King Lucas the Evil makes dejure claims on the Vale and the North successfully reclaims the entirety of Westeros in the name of what was once the iron throne but which is now renamed ""The Drowned Empire."" I and my 13 children call Lonely Light home. My son Lord Reaver Kromm of Harrenhal will inherit. Good luck to him in Essos because this was a long play and I am done. I did not conquer Essos but.... I could have haha.

Fun facts
Lucas the Evil is responsible for the public sacrifice of one High Septon, the dark dungeon deaths of two more High septons and the suspicious circumstances of an unknown number more. We are slowly making westeros believers of the drowned god.
The great sickness did strike the whole world. Except Lonely Light. I have no idea why but I have a screen shot. Nothing came close.
The Freys are everywhere and in fact I put one in charge of the Trident just to be a bit of a troll.
The Tyrells still hold the reach.
Shireen Baratheon held the Stormlands for her entire life but her son lost it to the Granddaughter of Tommen Lannister who still controls it to this day but the Stormlands Lannisters are currently losing against a Rhollor rebellion.
Dale Baratheon is the last stag and my Master of Whisperers.
The Velaryons have left Westeros behind and have conquered Mantarys near Mereen north of the fallen Valyria.
Dorne continues to be ruled from a direct line of Doran Martell.
There are no fewer than 9 Ironborn mini kingdoms that have been set up from Lords ""setting out to claim their own lands."" These lands are held in the name of Harlaws, Grimmins, Goodbrothers, and Botleys.
The Botleys were my most loyal family and were given Hammerhorn as a result as well as many other titles.

I never claimed a dragon.

Cadet houses that rose from Drowned Emperor Lucas the Evil include: Blackwynds, Greywynds, who are brothers of the same salt wife, Diresayls, Cruelseas, and Farshyps. A few others as well but they mostly died out during plague...

I am sure I missed a ton of stuff. If you are curious about any specific characters let me know! Hope you enjoyed reading this play through because it was very entertaining to live!",I have done this with house Drumm guess i gotta do it again ;),"Oh yeah... 

Going to give this a go with the following set up

AGOT + COG TRAITS + Kingsguard Sub + strong seed+ bloodlines+ personalized God/legendary_warrior sub. Will post my consequences.","I gave this a go. I was about 50 years in, had significant upgrades into Lonely Light. Unfortunately I was off reaving in Essos when some lord in the Summer Isles came after me. They were able to put about 3k troops on the island and when I landed my 2k to try to get them off, mine were beaten. As a consequence, my capital was decimated and I was deep in debt. Easy pickings for a rebellion. Did not beat any of the challenges. ",BARUK KHAZAD KHAZAD AI MENU,Yearly now LUL,"gonna do the challenge again, completed up to the extra extra extra challenge (and the impossible challenge of course) but I did it with euron's (rip) dragon which I feel like its cheating

The amount of random luck involved is hilarious.,"Hello, I just discovered Crusader Kings 2 and would like to purchase it but there are a couple of things that i don't really understand. can you please help with this: - when i purchase the game, the Mods are already included - if not, how exactly do i install them - do i have to pay for the extra Mods (like a game of thrones), or they are for free? thank you,",I had to give in and cheat myself some money so I could have some fucking ships. It's hard to make any money with the Farwynds when you can only make like 40 gold per raid at the start and your king throws a bitch fit every once in a while and makes you pay everything you just made back.,how do i get involved in this??,House Farwynd's words: Let's visit the Sunset Lands before the Sunset Lands visit us!,"i was thinking the same thing and will probably play this way.  I'd also try to create a line of never ending skinchanger kings since they can warg (or w/e its called) into seals, walrus or whales.  ","Yeah, great read. Keep me updated, this definitely seems interesting.",Good read!,"Good read. My own novel is coming soon haha.
","I got the Iron isles too

the entire greyjoy family got wiped out battling white walkers and a great council was held to decide the successor and they chose me for some reason lol","That's pretty interesting, how can you steal a dragon? Also which one was it?",Paper! ✋ I win,Paper! ✋ I win,Rock! ✊ We drew,Rock! ✊ We drew,awesome.,Rock! ✊ We drew,Scissors! ✌ I lose,I am having the same problem..even considering turning off the others invasions..but I do feel like the Farwynds being the last stand against Winter can be a badass game,"I was ill and had to leave University for a while lol, Don't expect another for a long time i'm afraid.",It was meant as a joke as I used to do these weekly but stopped a while back. ,AFFC,"well. That was short. Consider my line extinct haha.

I decided to remain true to the story and went a-conquering and raiding, but all of my male dynasty died off within a year to raids. I guess they just weren't all that good. Damn Summer Islanders just ate my guys up. 

Will give it another go soon, but am currently embroiled in a different campaign.","Mods are free, for AGOT you can find it [here](http://www.moddb.com/mods/crusader-kings-2-a-game-of-thrones-ck2agot). The folder where you install mods should be in documents/paradox interactive/Crusader Kings 2/mods. Just drop the .mod file and the folder into the mods folder. I don't know if you need any DLC for AGOT though, so you might want to check that out.

Also if you want any mod suggestions, I'd highly recommend checking out middle earth project(Lord of the Rings mod) and Elder Kings(Elder scrolls mod).

Anyways, hope you enjoy the game.","You can make legitimate money as the Farwynds, you just have to hussle hard for it. Try to look if you can invite a courier with high martial so you can get some more troops and then train your children to hopefully be solid commanders. Reavings usually turn a decent profit if your character isn't a weakling.  
  
Good thing about war is there are plenty of independent coastal provinces, I found the Stormlands to be easy pickings for Raiding. With a bit of luck you should also capture some Lord's families and get extra money from Ransoms. It adds up!

I dunno though, they might have stopped updating it.","That's unlucky but I mean hey, what are assassinations and being a royal pain in the ass for? I've been quite lucky so far because I had Euron and Victorian being kings and they stayed independent and lived like true reavers",Also what's with that dumb random event where one of your brothers forms his own raid group? Whenever that happens to me in my Lonely Light playthrough I suddenly end up besieged by my own brother who for some reason is stupid enough to raid his own house for gold and he is somehow fielding 5000 men when I can barely field 1.2K.,"Yeah, that is silly, never had that event yet though. At least they got rid of that glitch where raiding empty provinces gave you thousands of gold which resulted in some pirates having fully built up provinces which fielded revolts of 20k+.","I wanna see his stats! 

Also has he had babies with Missandei?",Barristan constantly pulls off the *craziest* stunts in his old age. I wrote up an observe game on here where he managed to have a kid with Dany at the age of 87. Another time he became a dragonslayer at 79.,How did that happen???,"Yeah, this exact thing happened in one of my games too.

And he's still alive and well at age 89 as well.](https://imgur.com/a/UhHmsTM)",If Dany has no kids and the Baratheon’s are dead then Barristan is usually the heir to Meeren.

If he didn't, he'd die like 4 years into the game",Honestly kinda canon tbh,"Actually, I was playing as the Baratheons and I was never offered the title...

I'm playing with more bloodlines, and married Sansa matrilinially to a Gendry stacked with Baratheon bloodlines, will marry her kids into my line for all those nice boosts.

Bran got Marge Tyrell, just had a daughter. Arya was found and is married to some old Frey... grim but we can fix that. Rickon is betrothed to Robb's acknowledged bastard with Jeyne...

Something odd happened - Jon was named LC after Jeor died (Jeor killed Mance in combat btw), but... Jon was then deposed and came to my court, although he was also their prisoner? I paid 10 gold and removed nightswatch from him. I brought Howland Reed to court but the event hasn't fired, annoyingly. When looking to get him a nice wife... Dany is available and open to a regular marriage. I want to get the event then marry him off but it doesn't seem to be coming...

Annoyingly, Joffrey is at the night's watch with the Iron Throne's treasury, it's a shame things like the dragon skulls can't be attached to the title rather than the king. Tywin died meaning Tyrion had Ice, and I didn't get it back when winning the war, another annoyance.

It does NOT add retinues.\n\n>    The Republic: Allows the Merchant Republic realms to be played, namely the Free Cities, Meereen, Yunkai, Astapor, Ibben, Asshai and the Guilds of Qarth. These realms will still be active even without the DLC.\n\n>    The Old Gods: Enables the concubine system for Drowned God, Dornish, Pirate, Eastern characters and others (Pre-DLC system will be used if not enabled). Also adds much flavour, including beserkers, adventurers, new rebels and runestones. Raiding is available for drowned god, wildlings, pirates and others even without this DLC.\n\n>    Sons of Abraham: Enables the council of the Most Devout and their election of the High Septon. Also adds many religious flavour events, including various Holy Order events/decisions.\n\n>    Rajas of India: Adds flavour to various far eastern cultures, including tiger hunts, gurus, reincarnation events and other flavour events.\n\n>    Charlemagne: Adds the chronicle, custom kingdoms (existing titular kingdoms are still available without DLC) and a \'hero knight\' flavour event\n\n>    Way of life: Enables the focus system, allowing a ruler to pick any of the foci available with all associated events decisions. Seduction focus replaces \'visit chambers\' interaction when DLC is enabled\n\n>    Horse Lords: Adds the nomad mechanics for Dothraki/Jogos Nhai (DLC now required to play these), landless adventurer mechanics for Ironborn, the wolf flavour events and land trade routes.\n\n>    Conclave: Adds the enhanced council/favour mechanics, new education focus system, dynamic mercenaries plus other misc flavour\n\n>    The Reaper\'s Due: Adds improved epimedic and illness mechanics, including hospitals and court physician treatment events. Adds prosperity and depopulation, as well as other flavour events.\n\n>    Monks and Mystics: Adds the devil worshiper societies (needs to be activated via game rules), crown jewell/weapon artefacts and new councillor job actions. Also add the paid quality of life features- allied AI orders and the improved child naming/prisoner interfaces\n\n>    Jade Dragon: Adds unjust conquest casus belli, chinese portraits/buildings which are used in Yi Ti, and some artifact/chinese flavour adapted for the mod.\n\n>    Holy Fury: Adds Shattered/Random World system, Warrior Lodge societies, Tiered-scar system, Kill List, Forge Bloodline ambition, Coronation decision, Sway and Antagonize decisions and other misc flavour. Roman portraits used in Asshai.\n\n> **Other DLC**\n\n>    Ruler Designer: Fully compatible with the mod\n\n>    Customiser: Fully compatible with the mod\n\n>    EU4 Converter: Not compatible\n\n>    Music Packs: The mod\'s soundtrack currently overrides them, however deleting ""A Game of Thrones/music/songs.txt"" will re-enable vanilla music\n\n>    African Unit Pack/Portraits: Used for the Summer Islanders, Basilisk Islanders and Sothoryos\n\n>    Mongol Portraits: Used for the Nefer and Yi Ti\n\n>    Turkish Portraits/units: Used for Lengi\n\n>    Spanish Portraits/units: Used for Moraqi\n\n>    Celtic Portraits/units: Used for Ibbenese\n\n>    All other Face/Unit Packs: Not used\n\n>    Dynasty Coat of Arms Packs: Not used\n\n>    Sunset Invasion: Some things may happen if enabled...\n\nAlso, the newer [sub-mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/wiki/submods) will be more likely to be compatible than the older ones, but I wouldn\'t use any that aren\'t listed as compatible with 1.8 or 1.9, due to how major the 1.8 update was.']}",{},"{'en8wyre': [1, 'did you delete every old mod file before updating it?\n\nno dlc is required']}",{},"{'eobflzr': [4, 'It is, but some have had issues with the steam version.

All of the children have the same parents (Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow, who has had his parentage revealed + legalized). Despite how much of a freaking lunatic Daenerys has become, the marriage is a happy one.\n\nAs of 321 AC, the Royal children consist of:\n\n* Aegon Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone. He is 20 years old and has a younger twin brother, Aemon. Aegon is ambitious, scholarly, brave, and honest, but despite their differences he is 100% loyal to his mother's rule. He is a liberator like her and a brilliant strategist, having smashed the forces of House Stark in the storming of Moat Cailin when he was only 16. He tamed the Queen's third original dragon, Viserion, and is ambitious; if Queen Daenerys were to die, Aegon Targaryen would eagerly continue his mother's work.\n\n* Aemon Targaryen, Prince of Summerhall is his younger twin. A Brilliant Steward, he is the realm's master of coin. He was married to the daughter of Bellegre Otherys, who is one of the few people with the Blood of the Dragon, being descended from Aegon IV and his lover, the original Black Pearl of Braavos. Aemon is quiet, troubled by Dragon Dreams at night that constantly make him aware of threats to his family. He is kind and just and spends his days gardening; though he has a positive opinion of his mother, he disagrees with her methods and cruelty. He and his wife have a five year old daughter named Daenerys, after the Queen. He rides the nimble dragon Artaxes, though it is still a small creature.\n\n* Daeron Targaryen is 19, and currently unmarried. He is a skilled leader of men and is the model of knighthood; honorable, chaste, diligent, etc. He has not done very much so far, but it's liekly he will be named to the Queensguard if a position becomes available soon.\n\n* Maekar Targaryen is the Queen's fourth son, 18, and much more agreeable with her style of rule. He is a ruthless man who wholeheartedly believes in his mother's plan to liberate those in chains, and will ruthlessly pursue that if given the chance. When Harrold Arryn was imprisoned and sent to take the Black, his widow Sansa was (forcibly) married to Maekar. While not a happy or pleasent marriage, if they do have any children then they would be potential lords of winterfell if House Karstark resorted to treason at a later point.\n\n* Aenar Targayren is the Queen's fifth son, 16, and the first to inherit the Stark look. Fashionable, Just, Honest; Aenar is a pretty nice guy all things considered. Right now he is unwed, but his love affair with Carriah Arryn (Harrold Arryn's daughter, kept at court as a ward/hostage) is an open secret. A marriage between the two is a possibility in the future, to mend the rift between House Arryn and House Targaryen.\n\n* Rhaella Targaryen is the Queen's sixth child, aged 15 and named after the Queen's mother. She was Daenerys' first daughter (despite having the ambition for years) and was married to her brother Aegon at 14. She is honorable, quick, fair, and content, an ideal wife for a Targaryen prince; though she is fire-obsessed like her mother. Five months ago she gave birth to a sickly son named Aurion, but so far the child has not died; if he can survive his crib, then Aurion Targaryen could potentially sit the Iron Throne after his father. She also has a young she-dragon as her mount, named Elaenal.\n\n* Jaehaerys Targaryen is only 13. A squire who is quick and fair, he shows more promise than his brothers did at his age. He is betrothed to his younger sister Rhaenyra, and when he turns sixteen the Queen intends to grant him the name 'Redwyrm', to take lordship over some of the Valyrian colonies and establish a healthy, *loyal* Targaryen cadet dynasty.\n\n* Rhaenyra Targaryen is 8, named for the only other woman to ever sit the Iron Throne. She is a shy girl with a stutter, and has her father's looks instead of her mother's\n\n* Rhaegar Targaryen is 5. An angry boy, it's hard to tell whether Rhaegar is destined for madness or greatness.\n\n* Visenya Targaryen is 3. She has the classical valyrian look and will surely be a fair woman in the future, though no one is certain whether she will marry one of her brothers, sold off to some other house, or perhaps become a warrior herself, like her namesake.\n\n* Aenyx Targaryen is only 1, but unlike his nephew he is in perfect health.\n\n* Daenaera Targaryen is the youngest child, being only a week old. She might potentially be betrothed to Aurion in the future, or married to Aenyx if he too is ordered to create another cadet dynasty.\n\nDaenerys isn't totally loved by her not-nearly-as-crazy children, but overall their family is only a bit dysfunctional. The real test will be how her grandchildren turn out, since Aurion was born a lunatic and two of her sons are both ambitious and not heirs, a bad combination.""]}","{'epxjgi5': [26, ""Trained Warrior, There's a submod from the old forum (idk if it is still there, if you want to look for it it's called Attris_gs) that changes what the personal combat skill traits look like.

It is criminal to claim that she has been showing maniacal tendencies when she has done nothing of the sort. Her order to kill everyone that follows Cersei runs counter to many previous orders she gave regarding defeated enemies. While the sack of Astapor remains a stark outlier, she showed mercy when treating with the masters of Yunkai and Mereen. And to further show this point, Dany has shown mercy 2 times to the Yunkai masters, only executing them when they reneged on their deals twice.\n\nAdditionally, Dany showed much mercy and locked up her own children when a child was burned and eaten by Drogon. It makes no sense for her to purposely cause that much destruction to many such children given she was shocked at the horrific burning of a little child.

Of course it needs to be far more developed, fleshed out, and you know... logical than the rushed mess of a character dive that we got in Season 8, and I honestly believe that GRRM will be able to do that in the books (I also think there will be other contributing factors leading to Daenerys\' downfall in the books, such as fAegon).\n\nAnd I do agree that after Season 8 we can all create an ending that we would prefer. The reason I gave my two cents was that I do believe the final season could\'ve created a logical and satisfying plot twist as to who will sit on the Iron Throne, when we\'ve all been expecting it to be Jon and/or Dany for years. I think that the fact that Season 8 is so terrible has let a lot of people to believe that any ending in which Dany doesn\'t go mad would\'ve been a good ending, and I\'m definitely not a fan of an ending in line with OP\'s CK2 game, but at the same time, I really, really can\'t blame you or anyone else for preferring this kind of ending over the train-wreck that was Season 8.']}","{'f84l8tt': [15, ""It's better than how the ending we got was presented at least, in my eyes.

More of a threat than Dany ever was previously and probably the Targs best hope at winning the throne back. Until that point the remaining Targaryens were toothless and totally without threat. With an army behind, possible support of magisters of the Free cities, Dany became a threat. \n\nPerhaps not a threat that would be guaranteed to win against Robert, but still a threat that would take troops, money and time to take down when it could be resolved more simply by assassination.

Fairly quickly brought the Reynes to House Lannister, taking the paramountship and leaving only the Lannisport Lannisters alive. Aegon also for some reason never converted to the Seven, and he and his successor kept asking to foster my children with Valyrian men and women, so I decided to take them up on that, converting to Valyrian religion and eventually to High Valyrian culture. \n\nA bit later, one of my characters, Rhaenyra Reyne, was proclaimed Queen at a Great Council. She colonized Velos and invaded Matarys to get three holy sites so she could reform her religion and proclaim herself the God Queen. After that, I may have used the console to fire the first event of the immortality event chain to make her a true God Queen, but apparently the end of the martial path is rebirth, not immortality. Decided not to save scum, as this could be interesting, so I named the reborn Rhaenyra lady paramount of the Westerlands and switched to her, leaving the first Rhaenyra's eldest son on the throne. He died about 8 years later, just in time to avoid the Others invading. \n\nRhaenyra managed to invade and annex the Reach without the new child queen bothering to tell her off and before Night's Watch fell. Rhaenyra committed the armies of the West to the defense of the Wall and then the North, after the Wall fell, but the Others had the numbers and commanders to win every invasion, exterminating many of the northern houses, including House Stark. The North fell to House Karstark (who later legitimized themselves as Starks), though there were only two of them left. When Rhaenyra finally turned 16, she took charge of her forces astride her ancient dragon Bloodwraith to finally win a defensive war against the invaders. She promptly declared the War for the Dawn, which was won by the time she was 19. \n\nAfter leading the defense of humanity, Rhaenyra was not going to kneel to anyone, especially not the weak queen on the throne, even if the girl was her niece. She was much beloved by the lords of the West and Reach for her able rule and by the Northmen for saving their lives and lands. Thus, when Rhaenyra proclaimed herself Queen of the Rock, not a single vassal stayed out of the war or joined their lawful liege. Rhaenyra also declared a dragon conquest of the Iron Islands (before raising any levies), to which the Ironborn acquiesced. The Targaryens of the Vale stayed out of the civil war, making the conflict four kingdoms against three (West, Reach, Iron Islands, and Northern allies vs Crownlands, Stormlands, and Dorne), which Rhaenyra won handedly. The weak Reyne queen was deposed a few years later in favor of a minor house Aegon had given Stokeworth after killing all the Stokeworths in the conquest, eliminating the truce Rhaenyra had with the Iron Throne.

The names of these wyrms are writ large in Westerosi history, and every child today knows of Solstice and Whiteclaw, Grey Ghost and Taelar, Volon 'the Liberator' and Caraxes Redscale, and Naerion and Tyriax the White Pearl, but back then, those dragons were still small and barely able to carry their riders on their backs. It was Vermithor, Silverwing, Balerion, Meleys the Devourer, and Queen Aerea's Vhagar who conquered and later held the Eastern lands - but this came later, only after the Academy was built. It is said that Jaehaerys was given the idea of building his Academy after flying on Vermithor's back to Dorne after conquering it. 'Ordinary men cannot hope to fly on a dragon's wings,' he is quoted, 'yet any man can soar on the wings of knowledge.' This quote gave the Maesters of the Academy their title of Winged, to differentiate them from the Citadel's Maesters - these men and women sail in the sky on their wings of knowledge, and strive to give the same to their students. After building his Academy and his network of roads, the King visited the Academy's lectures himself, where he pondered on what makes a man a man, and once again, he thought of his time on Vermithor's back. He came to the conclusion that freedom was what made man man, and it was what united all, from the poorest fellow in Flea Bottom to dragonriders themselves: the freedom to decide their own fate. By the same token, he realized that slavery was stripping man of all that made him so, a crime against nature itself. The Queens Alysanne and Aerea and his sister Rhaena were the first to learn of his plans to force Essos to abolish that barbaric practice, and became his greatest supporters in the years to come. For this reason, the Conquest of the East is also called the Women's Wars, for on dragonback, these three women - gentle Alysanne on Silverwing, vicious Aerea on Vhagar, and smart Rhaena on Meleys the Devourer - were fearsome indeed, more fearsome even than the King on Vermithor. \n\n    \n  The first polite, diplomatic requests to the Free Cities to stop their slaver's business had no effect, and so Jaehaerys chose to bring Fire and Blood to these 'enemies of humanity', as he called them. His women followed him, as did his vassals, with Lords Loreon Lannister, Prentys Tully and Osric Arryn distinguishing themselves with their efforts. Pentos fell in the first war in 77, then came Volantis and Myr in 84. Braavos fought on the side of Tyrosh in the next war in 89, and so both Braavos and Tyrosh were conquered. Jaehaerys, Prince Aegon, and Rhaena, who was the King's Hand in her last years, flew to Lorath together, without the King's armies, to declare war on the lands in 95. Lorath, back then, was governed by three Princes, whose names are lost to history except for Prince Meralyn 'the Sly'. He demanded a combat, three against three, as there were three princes of Lorath and three Targaryens, and they could each nominate one champion. If Lorath's champions won, Lorath would surrender without spilling blood, and if Jaehaerys' champions won, Lorath would be left alone by Targaryens for eternity. Jaehaerys wished to reject the proposal, but Aegon, never one to back down from a challenge, and Rhaena, always a step ahead of everyone else, together pushed him into accepting the terms. They had brought one Kingsguard each, on the back of their dragons, all of them fiercely loyal. The Lorathi Princes brought out the greatest warriors of Lorath - first, a man who claimed his father had been a leviathan from the deep ocean, a man who was broad and ugly, but with a strength that could subdue a hundred foes; second, a woman from the island of Ibben, who was covered in black hair all over and towered over all three Targaryens; and third, a Dothraki horselord, fearsome to behold with two curved arakhs at his sides and an uncut braid reaching his ankles. It is said that Jaehaerys grew pale at the look of these warriors, and Aegon visibly recoiled. Only Rhaena did not react. 'Who will you name as your champions?' said Prince Meralyn, and Jaehaerys took one look at his knightly companions - all three of whom could never hope to match these monsters in a melee - and his own son before he drew Blackfyre from its sheath, willing to sacrifice his life to spare at least one of them certain death. Yet Rhaena lowered his weapon, and stepped forward. A small woman, her silver hair now grey, she could not hope to match any single of these monsters of men, even less all three. 'Prince Meralyn, you have forgotten who we are. We may wear three heads on our coats, but Targaryens have never needed more than one champion. My brother's champion shall be my own beloved Meleys!' she bellowed, and with a roar, her dragon appeared behind her. This was the day Meleys the Devourer received her name, as she descended upon the three warriors, opened her jaws, and swallowed them one after the other. Lorath had no choice but to surrender.   \n\n  \n  The tale of Lorath's surrender spread far and wide, and suddenly, the Essosi lords and princes saw no more reason in fighting these new dragonlords. Qohor and Norvos surrendered, as did the colonies along the Rhoyne. Even now, slavery was not eradicated, and so, on his deathbed in 97, Jaehaerys made Prince Aegon promise he would complete his life's work, to bring the dragon's justice as far as the Dothraki Sea and Slaver's Bay. The Crown Prince, Aegon 'the Childless' had never forgotten his father's indulgence in his youth, and so when the Philosopher died, Aegon was crowned by the High Septon and the very next day mounted Balerion to fly to Meereen... But the journey of Aegon 'the Childless' to become Aegon 'the Glorious' is another story, to be told another day. Jaehaerys, it is said, died happily, with his beloved Alysanne's hand on his cheek, his great-granddaughter Naerys' laughter in his ears, and a smile on his lips.""], 'ewst21z': [25, 'Some dumb random stuff from that playthrough: \n\n* because all the Martells died of greyscale, Dorne elected a Toland lady as their new Princess, who held her throne for all of 6 months, and then another Prince, a 10 year old rando from an AI generated (?)

I might make an AAR when the save finally stops being able to play since people seem to be pretty interested, but for now heres the Great House list!\n\nCurrent Houses:\n\n* House Targaryen - The Kings of course, not much to explain here\n\n* House Tyrell - One of the three remaining original Great Houses, House Tyrell has been pretty stable for the whole time, never once losing it's seat or rebelling against the throne, so the Reach is overwhelmingly stable.\n\n* House Goldfyre - After House Lannister's last male lord died the throne passed back to the crown. King Jacaerys gave the Westlands to his second son, Daeron the Eagle, who was then wed to Jeyne Lannister, taking the name Goldfyre. They have not only dragons, but also the wealth of the Gold Mines of the Westerlands. So while they aren't the oldest cadet line, they are the strongest.\n\n* House Redwyne (of the Trident) - The Riverlands were originally under the domain of a Stark branch but after they died out the Crown would see fit to name a second son of House Redwyne as Lord Paramount since the Redwynes would have no local power base aside from Riverrun itself, and thus they'd be pretty incapable of threatening the throne. Right now King Valarr II is rivals with the current Redwyne Lord in Riverrun though, so the Lord Paramount title could be shifted to a different House in the near future depending on if the title is revoked in the future.\n\n* House Arryn - Perhaps even more unchanged than House Tyrell, the Arryns have also maintained their hold on the vale and have become quite the loyalists over the years, with several Hands and Queen-Consorts being Arryns.\n\n* House Evelion - Founded after Gaemon the Warrior conquered the stepstones, this house is relatively minor compared to the other Lord Paramounts since the Stepstones are poor and the Evelions are a very young house. Despite this, they are stable too.\n\n* House Codd - Granted the Iron Islands after House Greyjoy died out, the Codds are a weird bunch. At some point they married a Targaryen Princess and because House Codd has divine blood abilities, they have maintained the Valyrian look for over 100 years at this point. This includes Dragons too, so they have an easy time keeping their hold on the Isles. The Current Lord is the Grandfather of King Valarr II, and the Codd's conversion to the Seven has almost eliminated the Drowned God's faithful in the Iron Islands in the last 50 years.\n\n* House Icefyre - Similarly to House Lannister's successor, the Icefyres are the oldest Targaryen cadet branch who were granted Winterfell/The North after House Stark ended. In a similar situation, the King's second son (and child of Argelle Stark, the last living Stark) similarly was given the region to start the oldest of the Targaryen cadet branches. Similar in power to the Goldfyres, if House Targaryen were to die out then there would surely be a second Dance between the two families.\n\n* House Baratheon - The Baratheons have been pretty quiet this game, but their allegiance to the Targaryens has been renewed a few times through quite a few royal marriages, but even to this day they still have their black hair and blue eyes despite all the valyrian marriages.\n\n* House Manderly (of Andalos) - A secondary branch of House Manderely of White Harbor, the Manderlys were granted Andalos after Gaemon III's war for the Seven's holy land. With the lands of Hugor of the Hill now under faithful rule again, Lord Manderly was given the title by Gaemon III on his deathbed as a way to keep the peace with the Starks/Greyjoys who might have felt threatened by the militarized spreading of the Seven.\n\nNotably excluded are Dorne (the king inherited it through marriage so there are still a few Martells around, but they don't have any titles right now) and Beyond-The-Wall. Both of these regions have elective monarchies, so the top-level title is constantly in flux between the Bannermen. Right now Dorne is ruled by House Uller, and Beyond-the-Wall is ruled by the wildling Casey Icebane.""]}","{'ed3xptg': [1, 'Not that I know of, I have some retinues up there though so any rebellion they have gets crushed in about a month or so anyway.']}","{'ed41xyz': [6, ""The way I set this one up is that rather than it just be Rhaegar winning on the Trident, instead the premise is that Aerys doesn't attend the tourney of Harrenhal. This lets Rhaegar plot like he planned with Great Lords and others who might have been scared off by Aerys unexpectedly attending like he did in canon, so Rhaegar instead gets wrapped up in Rickard's Southron Ambitions. This means he has the support of House Stark  through Rickard, House Arryn through Jon Arryn who had been fostering Ned and Robert, and House Tyrell since they like Rhaegar alot more than Aerys and want to benefit from when Rhaegar becomes king. So instead of Robert's Rebellion you get Rhaegar's Rebellion, but he still has a few obstacles; He's still going after Lyanna so Robert is still pissed at him and not really willing to help, Tywin is still Hand of the King since Aerys never named Jaime to the Kingsguard at Harrenhal, and Dorne is neutral for the moment since they are worried that Rhaegar intends to remove Elia's children from the succession if he takes a new wife. \n\nNow I haven't written the battles summary yet, but i can give a general overview of this war. In the end there is no coup since Rhaegar is found out by Varys after he heads North to rally an Army, so Aerys starts the war by disinheriting Rhaegar (and his children) and naming Viserys the new heir. Now Tywin is onboard again since there is a real chance of marrying Cersei to Viserys, and some on the fence lords like the Tullys stay Loyalist for the time since Rhaegar seemingly only has the North and Vale to count on. As the war goes on and the Rebels get more victories (and Aerys shows himself to be way crazier than everyone thought, since he never went to Harrenhal so most lords hadn't yet seen how unraveled he was yet) more lords go to Rhaegar's side, who at this point has taken Lyanna as a wife and signs more or less a renewed Pact of Ice and Fire, promising offices, lands and a Targaryen Princess to House Stark. To bring Dorne fully to his side he decress that Aegon will remain his heir ahead of any children he has with Lyanna. House Tully is forced to concede since the Riverlands are hard to defend against two different neighboring Kingdoms; Harrenhal and Esgaroth are made part of the Crownlands, but in return House Tully is untouched itself and the originally planned Stark-Tully and Arryn-Tully marriages go through (Ned still replaces Brandon in the succession but i'm undecided if it's through Brandon dying in previous battles or getting disinherited somehow). Robert originally fights for the Loyalists due to his animosity with Rhaegar, but after losing the Battle of Ashford and retreating to the Riverlands hes forced to choose either fighting Jon Arryn and Ned and their host or switching sides, and in the end Robert too switches for the sake of his best friend and his mentor, even if he still despises Rhargar for taking his betrothed. Now with the Momentum against Aerys, they march on King's Landing. Faced with the combined forces of 4 Great House the gates are thrown open, so while the city isn't brutally sacked Aerys still dies at Jaime's hand (he was named a Kingsguard after Aerys blames Tywin for the war progressing badly) to prevent the city from burning like in canon. Thus Rhaegar takes the throne, but the War leaves the realm divided and unhappy, setting the stage for the wars in ACOK which aren't the canon ones, but i'm not ready to reveal them yet until i finish the actual lore doc.\n\nTL;DR Rhaegar dethrones his dad as he originally planned, but things still aren't well and in 8299 there are alot of lords who want revenge or feel left out ever since the Rebellion and they try to change that.""]}","{'ed2mzc6': [7, ""They are Targaryens so quite a few, but as of recently I've been marrying into the Cadet branches half the time since I need to keep their lords loyal, otherwise they might try to press their claims or use their dragons to wreck the Kingdom.""]}",{},"{'ed2l55d': [25, ""I did get a dragon egg from colonizing summerhall, but I already had 3 dragons from Daenerys (I started in 8299, the bookmark I used was a custom-modded ACOK scenario going off of the idea of Rhaegar winning the Rebellion and being King, which i'm planning to make into a submod).\n\nAs for the Dragonlord and Dragonslayer, they were pretty badass. Jaehaerys the Dragonlord is the alternate version of Jon in this scenario. He was originally named Lord of Summerhall, but after Aegon VI died in the War for the Dawn he inherited the throne. He then reigned for 40 years or so, managing to fight about a dozen wars and outliving his oldest 5 children, before the throne was eventually inherited by his grandson, Daeron. Lucerys the Dragonslayer came quite a bit later, and he got up to so much mischievous nonsense because he inherited Dragonstone from his father, the eldest son of Aemon II, so he ran around as Lord of Dragonstone for about 10 years, during which he slayed a Dragon with Dark Sister giving him an ironic nickname considering his family.

His sexuality is not overt, you might miss it if you don’t pick up on the small clues. It’s just a piece of his character, not the focus.\n\n5. The overarching themes of GRRM’s work.\n\nThis is one that really riles up game of thrones fans, but GRRM’s magnum opus is unlikely to be a ‘good vs evil’ story at all. I doubt the white walkers (the Others as they’re named in the books) are ‘evil’, they’re probably mutated humans suffering from an inbreeding depression.  I also doubt R+L=J is real, as it seems against the spirit of GRRM’s message, that feudalism is bad and violence begets violence. Jon is the saviour of the world because his father (a twenty something year old man) kidnaps and falls ‘in love’ (🤢🤢🤢) with a FOURTEEN year old girl? \n\nSorry, another common theme of GRRM’s is that prophecy is bullshit, usually the ploy of enemies trying to get people to turn on and kill eachother.\n\nTL:DR, look at the first sentence of every paragraph and you’ll get the idea.']}",{},"{'egr0gfp': [8, 'Im not your mon ami, friendo.']}","{'egr9egj': [1, ""You kind of do when the show was supposed to be a TV adaptation of the books.

Cersei as queen doesn\'t make much sense but they were a bit stuck with that. I think the showrunners wanted an endgame ""big bad"" and to condense the size of the cast. It was too late to build anyone else up.\n\n2. Arya\' plotline was extremely poor writing and very disappointing. I don\'t think they knew what to do with that storyline at all. The fact that she ended her faceless man arc with the same personality and seemingly little skill as a faceless man and came back to Westoros as an experienced, cold assassin was shitty, shitty writing but they did the same thing with Bran. All of his difficult character progression happened off screen. They are not great writers but it\'s also partly Martin\'s fault. Bran and Arya have difficult arcs to conclude especially when there\'s so much information missing about how The Faceless Men and Three-eyed Raven works. I don\'t think there are many writers talented enough to fill in gaps that even Martin is have trouble filling in. \n\n3.  I\'m sure Stannis will meet a similar end in the books but it will be better written. I was never a big fan of his either way.\n\n4. The writing for Loras and the other gay characters is more homophobic and stereotypical than anti-male. They made all of the gay guys a lot more feminine than they are in the books. They even made Yara(Asha) a butch lesbian because a tough chick with short hair couldn\'t possibly be attracted to men./s I\'m surprised they didn\'t also make Brienne a lesbian. \n\n5. I\'m a believer in R+L=J so I don\'t really know what to say there but I didn\'t think it was a ""true love"" thing.  I agree that Martin likes to defy commen narrative tropes and D&D are hacks that can\'t write a story without them. The sanitization of Tyrion is their worst offense in my opinion. The show has ruined his character arc because show only fans will get pissed off of they see one of their favs commit cold blooded murder and rape underage slave prostitutes.\n\n6. I think the prophecies are more complex than just ""bullshit"". \n\n\nI\'m not going argue with anyone that says D&D are bad writers, I completely agree. Season 7 was the worst season by far. I just don\'t think that ""girl power"" is the reason for the decline.
