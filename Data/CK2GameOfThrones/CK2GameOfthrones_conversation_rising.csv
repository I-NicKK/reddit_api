Euron then went on to solidify the Reach by making a Ironborn the LP and many High Lords of the Reach.  This was followed by an invasion of the North under a Rhllor Rickon.

Now I do have Viserion but he pales compared to Euron so I may have to wait for him to die to realistically survive this.  His heir won't be able to tame a dragon afterall.

Before that though, I'm gonna test out invading the Ironborn while Euron is still alive since its more fun.","You get a good look at a possible way the books will go.

This is hilarious.","You can use your Master of Laws to fabricate a claim on a title, most of the time only on a single province but sometimes (rarely) they can claim a high lordship, kingdom or even Empire in your name.  Thus far I've only seen the AI successfully fabricate a claim on the Iron Throne but it should be possible for human players.

You can also gain a claim by marrying one of the first born daughters of a title you want so a grandchild in the future has a claim too it.  Like how the Baratheon got picked to be the new kings in Lore.

You can also invite someone with a claim and press it against an enemy.  If you win that person gains the title and becomes your vassal.  An example would be if Cersei was ruling the Westerlands and you managed to get Tyrion to join your court, you can do a Northern War vs the Westerlands to overthrow Cersei and put Tyrion on the Westerland throne, who'd then become your vassal.

Finally you can tame a dragon an force vassalize the world with the Dragon Conquest CB.","Thanks, that was very helpful!
