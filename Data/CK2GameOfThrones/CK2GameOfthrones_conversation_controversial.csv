Sometimes it's needed to compensate for bugs. I think that is partially why Paradox makes it so you can basically do anything with the console. 

I'll admit though that I use it to buff the starts of rulers/countries I want to play but whose situations demand a bit of luck.

I have to save often though, usually every half year (so january 1st and sometime in June/july). On top of the auto saves, I save when I feel important things have happened.  

I'll admit, I've been screwed by ironman, losing one time 24 hours worth of game play because I forgot I turned off auto save and forgot to manually save.  I was trying to fix my sleep schedule and yeah, it got pretty bad at the end, lol!

Sometimes I'll cheat, but I only use the money cheat.  I'll just play the characters with what I get, using what I have in the game for marriages and what not.  I used to cheat traits and attributes, but I don't anymore, I only use the money cheat.

For me though, Ironborn can get you a lot of money.  Just simply raiding, and if you can sack the entire province you're gonna make even more bank. As Farwynd, I had no issues making money this way.

Maybe he talked to her as she was dying and told her about Ashara and she wanted him to tell the world or maybe to break up? Why else did Ashara chose to jump off the castle into the sea? Because her brother died? That's stupid, she has a younger sister to look after, as well as a young cousin (Gerold), plus her older brother (Lord of Starfall). Its only more suspicious that she kills herself AFTER having a talk with Ned who we know had the possibility of liking her who may have taken her child away from her. No one talks about her anymore because they don't want to bring up her suicide, but maybe also because of another reason? The Dornish stick with their own and don't want the Andals in their affairs.

Am I disappointed with the possibility of R+L=J as the new video snippets are potentially suggesting? Yes.

","We don't know anything about Lyanna condition post birth, or what Rhaegar fed her about his prophecy and he was dead by then .

But i don't think it subverts book canon until we know what his actual Targaryen name is/was, since for all we know Rhaegar pulled a George Foreman with his sons and gave them both the name of the Conquerer. After all, this is wold be low on the list of Rhaegar's poor decision making. This is assuming Rhaegar even chose his name at all, since he was killed by Bobby B before Jon was even born. Rhaegar's children are also murdered by the time Jon is born as well, so for all we know he was named in honor of his now-dead brother (or he was meant to be a Visenya in the first place), but this is all just speculation. 

I think the best compromise for the mod would be to use Aemon, which is the name the mod uses for Jon if Rhaegar returns to the Tower of Joy alive. It's similar to Aegon, it's already in the mod, and there is a precedent of past Aegons having younger brothers named Aemon","I mean by the time Jon was born the war was over and the original Aegon would have been dead yeah? So maybe Lyanna named Jon Aegon after the first kid? 

Personally I don’t think his name will be Aegon in the books (honestly I don’t we’ll get a name reveal in the books), but its a possibility I guess. ",[deleted],"I like this theory,to be the reason ""the only Dayne that anyone remembers "" is dead and causing the ""suicide"" of Ashara Dayne,Ned should aleast be hated by then,but what happens is quite the contrary.They named the heir to Starfall in his honor and even call him by the Stark lord's nickname 'Ned'.The Daynes love him.Allyria knows about Ned and Ashara's relationship and Edric Idolizes him.I think the Daynes aro too isolated in between their mountais.They have secrets of their own.

About N+A=J, I believe Ned slept with her at Harrenhall(281).Robb was Born in 283, even if we lowball the age diference between (A+N) Jon and Robb, people wouldn't believe when Ned said Robb was Elder.The diference in looks between the babies would make quite noticiable who is the firstborn,Jon.And that is not what happens in cannon. Though I do believe Ned and Ashara had a bastard that he may not knows...","Very good points, all. I failed to consider the fact that baby Aegon is likely dead by the time Jon is born. Same thing happens in Dune, so I guess there's a precedent.","Rhaegar wanted a lot of things, but what he got was a Warhammer in the chest and two dead kids.

Lyanna naming Jon Aegon makes sense if she heard everything that went down. Since she had 3 kingsguard present who were willing to die defending her from her own brother, it's a sure bet they knew what happened and what would happen if Robert got his hands on the baby. Otherwise, if they thought that the baby was in no danger, as his uncle Ned wouldn't be doing the kid harm, they'd have stepped aside. Their oath was to protect the kings family, and that only comes into play if they believe that family is in danger, and that's only the case if they believe letting Ned see his sister will result in Robert getting his hands on the baby, which only matters if the expected result of that is death. Given this, and knowing that Kings Landing has fallen, everyone at the Tower Of Joy knows that Aegon is dead, or at least assumes so, so naming the new baby Aegon isnt stupid, but an homage to his murdered half brother.","Ok, I am all for shitposting but we are not bringing modern day American politics into a subreddit about a mod for CK2 based on a mythical world where we have users from many different countries.

On one hand, she's too focused on proving that she's as smart as Tywin, and as other users have said, she is rather narcissist, paranoid, arbitrary and ambitious.

It is for people who are significantly less intelligent than average without being imbeciles.

I mentally rekt him so hard so that he hated me and call me ""biggest enemy of targaryen house"" but who care targaryen line gonna die out with him

His world is so ridiculously vast, he has thought about everything. 

That said, I don't really feel like any of your suggestions fit. Reyne was around a long time and their reputation wasn't always as the house that wanted to undermine and overthrow the Lannisters, that only came toward the end. 

'It always falls' or something else relating to red and rain. That's all I could really think of haha! ","""Fill Her Hoo-Haa With Goof Juice""",Definitely C.,"I like: ""And who are you?""","*""And who are you, that I must bow so low?""*","I think on the got or asoiaf wiki House Reyna is noted as having ""A lion still has claws"" as their house words. Which I think is cool and kind of a classic GOT house motto. We may be regal, but we'll still fuck you up. ","I say C or E.

While D sounds badass, I don't think it's really ""lore friendly"" prior to the start of the Reyne-Tarbeck revolt.",The Red Reyne Falls ,"I doubt that the Reynes were here before House Lannister, as it is one of the oldest houses. It is more likely, given all the rivalry they have (which was there even before Tytos ascended) that Houses Reyne and Lannister started prospering at the same time. 

So I think that b anb d do make SOME sense.

Of course a is obviously a joke.

Now, b could work. Think of it this way: The line in Rains of Castamere was a reference to their words.

There is a theory out there (which has been deleted sadly) that has House Reyne being a cadet branch of House Casterly, thus their rivalry with Lannisters.

If that's true or if the Reyens were indeed there before the Lannisters came then e would make the most sense out of all.

Castamere gains it's name from a mere close to the province. A mere is a large mass of still water. And Reynes have been known to lay low (thus the beneath part) most of the time. 

Beneath Still Waters implies a storm/danger lying beneath a calm surface. The Reynes broke their calm surface ALWAYS in events of geat importance such as the Blackfyre Rebellion and the War of Ninepenny Kings.

Your suggestion is pretty good on itself though. It would also make for a great insult after the House fell at Tywin's hands.",House Greyjoy? Is Theon affecting all of you?,Nope. Neither of them lists House Reyne's words and that's cause they have not been revealed.,"E sounds the most out of place, presumably referring to dead family members.",Seems to arrogant for them to have their own name in their words. Perhaps The Rain Falls or Red Rain or something...but Red Rain is the name of their valyrian steel sword so it still is kinda arrogant.,"It's not about doubting,it's confirmed ","Weird, could've swore I had seen it somewhere on an unofficial site. I still think D works the best. In my head, it could be that the songwriter was purposefully playing with the phrase for the song: i.e. While it was their family words, it also represented that the Lannisters still had claws, and that they were ""just as long and sharp"". ","E refers to Castamere. The lands of the Reyens get their name from a mere that's closeby. A mere is a large mass of still water. It also fits for two reasons:

1)It is the exact opposite of House Lannister's motto ""Hear me Roar"". While the Lannister words are bold and have an in-your-face attitude, the ""Beneath Still Waters"" denotes a calm looking surface, with a raging storm underneath it.

2)The Reynes were known to have bunkers in Castamere, hence the beneath aprt.

there is a whole theory on why these words are fitting, just search house reyne words in google and hit the second link.","Eh, true.",That could still be somebody else's sword though.,"According to the mod, which I assume is based on canon or at least semi canon sources, Lann the clever was born in 158 while the Reyne founder in 180. Even though the mod has Lann as an unlanded character, the firt Lannister to hold land was his daughter Lanna who was born in 195. I am going to contribute that to an error as we know Lann the Clever took Casterly Rock from House Casterly.

So. The Lannister line predates the Reyne line for 22 years. It is possible though that the Reynes have been in possession of land for a longer time since we do not know if it was Ryon of Castamere or Lann the Clever who first got hold of a piece of land.

So, all in all I think it is appropriate to say that houses Reyne and Lannister flourished at the same time.

EDIT: In the case you were backing up what I was saying, then thanks. xD","I like your way of thinking. 

However the son itself says that it's the Reynes that say the lines 

""And who are you the proud lord said, that I must bow so low? Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know. In a coat of gold or a coat of red a lion still has claws. And mine are long and sharp my lord, as long and sharp as yours.""

How can we be sure of that? Because the next line is this:

""And so he spoke, and so he spoke.That lord of Castamere.""

So it is a pretty fitting motto (as I said I can't decide which of the ones I listed to use)

But it refers to the Reynes thinking they are equal to the Lannisters. Not to the Lannisters still being tough despite Tytos being a wimp.",Where'd you get a mere is a body of water from?,"Their sword, Red Rain, was taken from them by House Drumm I think (I know it was an Ironborn House). It still remained as the Reyne ancestral sword though, despite being stolen and used by another family.","As, I thought it went Lannister then Reyne, i.e. 

Reyne: ""Who are you, that I must bow so low?""

Lannister: "" Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know. In a coat of gold or a coat of red a lion still has claws. And mine are long and sharp my lord, as long and sharp as yours.""

And then the ""and so he spoke"" was just pointing out that he did a lot of talking but it all ended up on empty ears, because they murded the fuck out of his house. 

Butttttt, I think you're right. Anyway, let me know what you pick, I would be interested in doing a similar playthrough. Also, I figured out where I saw ""A lion still has claws"". It's one of the flair options for House Reynes on the GOT subreddit. Haha, I'm not sure why I was so sure I had seen it on the wiki, and not just some silly flair. ","Mere can actually mean ""lake"". Wow learning things on the GoT reddit, neat.","It means large, but sallow body of still water. I don't think I can link wikipedia so if you want search mere(lake)","But House Reyne IS arrogant, that is the whole point. Also, has Red Rain been confirmed to be the sword of house Reyne? I knew it was a theory but not if it was 100% true. (It was house Drumm that took it)",It's not confirmed to be house Reynes sword is what I was saying.,"If I played during the Reyned&Tarbeck Rebellion I could have the words of House Reyne be ""Beneath Still Waters"" (as they had just helped the Lannisters a little while ago and now are suddenly rebelling) and have Roger Reyne's (the then head of the house) words be ""A Lion Still Has Claws"".

But that's not true. At all.

Only Balon justified his wars on the basis of Might Makes Right, and that was because of the unique nature of Ironborn culture. ","> The solution is now finding a mod for everyone else to exclude the necessity of having CB.

That's a default setting in the rules already. ","""Fucking unbalanced piece of shit.""

-Harren Hoare, last words.","It's not one person, it's everyone with a dragon. If you had a dragon, you'd probably conquer whatever you wanted, cus you have a dragon, and no one else does.","Actually, that's only the second war, as his first rebellion was grounded in the idea that Robb used to justify declaring independence rather than declaring for Stannis or Renly, that his ancestors swore loyalty to the Targs, and thus are not obliged to swear fealty to any other dynasty. That is, the idea that a united Westeros is not itself a valid de jure empire, but rather a collection of Kingdoms that have sworn fealty to a particular dynasty, and that those Kingdoms can leave should the dynasty change.

His second war was an I'll conceived revenge rampage for the Starks killing his sons, and had no clear objectives beyond break shit. He said he wanted to conquer the North but fought the war like a raid.","Nah, I'd use it to shore up my defences and turn my provinces into an unassailable fortress country. Then I'd fly to Yi Ti and back for spices.
","I also have to add that part of what Martin does in the series is examin how the whole cassus belli thing is kinda bullshit, in that it's a veneer. It is usually followed, and it serves to at least somewhat keep the peace, mainly by getting people to agree to resist someone acting without cb, or at least not support them. Aegon throws that concept right out of the window as he just says 'I'm taking over because I can, if you disagree try to stop me."" The Ironborn culture preaches might makes right and taking what you want by force, but even they usually restrict that to raiding. Aegon just called the system bullshit and decided he could burn any resistence. 

More subtly, several examples. Daemon Blackfyre and his supporters rebelled because they thought he would be a better king, noy because he had any real right to the throne, and cooked up the argument that since Aegon IV gave him Blackfyre he was signaling a preference that he inherent the throne as cover. It was obvious that they just prefered Daemon or were looking to profit from his victory, but they had to have a legal argument, however flimsy, to provide deniability that it was just a lower grab. Robert and his supporters are mostly well aware that his cb was bs. He had a valid reason to revolt against Aerys, and even to war against Rhaegar (at least if the realm believed or accepted the rape and kidnapping accusation). But why not hand the realm to Viserys or little Aegon with a regent? The idea that the actions of Aerys and Rhaegar deligitmized their entire dynasty rather than only themselves had no basis in anything, and his reasoning for getting the Throne himself was a stretch. Hell, it argued that the Targs were deligitmized but he claimed legitimacy as King by being descended from Targs. The real reason he was going to be King was because he won the war and he had the power, not because he had a legitimate legal reason. And the war itself was quite obviously predicated on the King and prince personally wronging him, the Starks, the Tully's, and the Arryns. It was prosecuted based on the fact that Robert, Ned, and Jon realized that they had 4 of the 7 Kingdoms on their side while another was going to sit out because its LP was still pissed at the Throne. Even Danny is confronted with the idea that her claim doesn't matter, her ability to march into Westeros and take it over does. Her claim is only important insofar as it makes it easier for lords that prefer her rule to declare for her, but honestly if she landed with three dragons and thousands of unsullied and Dothraki and pointed to them as her reason for taking the Throne she'd get the same response. Does show Olenna declare for her because she believes in her claim, or because Cersei blew up her family and Danny   is strong enough to overthrow cersei?

When Garris died, the title passed to Tyler and Shyra's only son, Galbert, who is now Lord Paramount of the North (and of asian appearance lol)

The [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/25w95c/the_oh_my_god_im_new_help_guide_for_beginners/) comment on this thread talks briefly about claims.



What the [CK2 wiki](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Claims) has to say about claims.


__________________________________________________________________________

What's immediately relevant to your situation is that

A.) You yourself will have no claim on the North, whether or not you declare or win a war. Your children with Sansa will all have claims, and her heir - who will likely be your heir, since you're married - will inherit the North.

B.) There are strong claims and weak claims. (99% of) Strong claims are just straight up claims. Weak claims can only be pushed against certain kinds of rulers (females and children and those defending against another claimant) and aren't always inherited by their children.

C.) Most importantly, once Sansa is landed, that is, you've successfully made her a Lady Paramount, she'll be out of your control. That is, she'll move to her own court and start making her own decisions as a landed noble (as opposed to the landless people in your court).","Workd, Thanks! :)",What's the problem with possessed or lunatic?

However, if you have a claim fabricated you can use that to declare war. If you have a claim then you should see a sword icon at the top of the middle of your screen. you click it to cycle through the different claims. When you see the person you want to declare war on just go to their personal interaction screen and press declare war and pick your reason. ","There are many ways to gain land in CK2. The most obvious way is fabricating claims using your master of laws this however has a small chance of success even with the best master of laws and will cost you gold and prestige. 
The other way is inheriting it from family members. Say your Robb, if you marry Margaery Tyrell then her brothers die then she will get high-garden and then her son (who should be of house Stark) Will inherit it as well or you declare war on the reach to press her claims for her if you don't think her brothers will die, however to do this she must be 2nd or 3rd in line to inherit and I think the ruler has to be female/child/infirm. 

Finally you can press the claims of your vassals which is one of the more common tactics at the king/Lord paramount level. However this can be risky as if they are not someone you can trust they may cause trouble for you.

Once in a blue moon somebody tries to kill somebody, either because they don't like the person or because they want their position. But that's it.

At any point there should be factions and people trying to stir the pot.

But on the mod that isn't the case.

> I believe it's like that because the time period is too short, and there are no substantial events happening like IRL history.

It's the usual fantasy fair, technology doesn't advance at a reasonable pace.

There is no big religious strife, as we see in CK2 with the reconquest, the mongols, the pagans.

As far as I'm aware, these guys aren't earning any money from this.

Again, I don't mean to bash you or say you're not entitled to your opinion. Things can always be improved upon.

Not sure if you can search for artifacts as well on the character search like you can traits so it'd make it harder to see who has blackfyre or dark sister on the targs.~~

nvm the game still has a valyrian icon on the portrait and character search works with artifacts","Publish the submod, I agree this is pretty stupid.",I think it would be good if they could have the generic sword icon look like the actual sword they have. Like using the old trait icons on the portrait,My only concern with Valyrian Steel as artifacts...can you lose them permanently when transitioning to a new ruler?,"I think in the books they function more like Traits than Artifacts. 

A Character who wields a Valyrian Steel weapon tends to regard the weapon as part of his/her identity (""never seen without"", etc.). The weapon would be among the first ""traits"" mentioned whenever the character is described or depicted (by GRRM or in-universe characters). You see Valyrian Steel weapons mentioned profusely in-universe in fables and legends. Dark Sister for example, is described as having a personality and a legendary history of its own, almost as if it is a character in its own right. 

Hardly any of the above can be said of other Artifacts. 

If pets (Ravens, Dogs, etc.) are Traits then I don't see why Valyrian Steel weapons should not be. ","I agree.

If your ruler dies in battle or is assassinated there’s still something like a 15-20 percent chance you can lose something.","I see people sharing this opinion about artifact loss on succession, but I really don't understand the thinking. History is full of countless examples of prized possessions being lost through time and nearly all of them were owned by people of means at one point.  

Plus, both vanilla and this mod have events/decisions that focus on reclaiming lost artifacts so they're never really gone indefinitely. Maybe if instead of just losing it outright it was treated as a theft with the potential to immediately investigate and start the search for the item would be a better compromise?","They added this to patch 1.6 for Jade Dragon. Now that the VA Swords are artifacts, it would make sense that they are easier to steal, much to the joy of Ironborn players everywhere and the detriment of everyone else.

In hindsight, I didn't even consider the stealing mechanics of the new system when I was writing my rant to be honest.","I won't argue that the artifacts can be improved over the next patch cycles. Heck, there are plenty of art for the many Valyrian Steel Swords out there that can be used as icons (if the game engine permits it of course).

Having the swords as traits though was a pivotal part of my enjoyment of the game.","Yes. I consider it clunky. And there was nothing wrong with the old system. And my stance on this was always to keep artifacts and Valyrian Steel Swords separate.

Because now we have generic icons on character portraits to mark sword ownership, generic artifact icons and we still need to keep the sword traits for historical ownership meaning that the traits are still hardcoded in the mod. And that's clunky work in my book.

Valyrian Steel Swords are one notch above in importance compared to artifacts. They are items of legend integral to the characters they belong to and they deserve a system of their own and the system they had was a defining feature for the mod that I enjoyed greatly.

Sure, the new system can be improved further now that we have an inside man on Paradox, but I feel that a major feature of the mod was plucked out just because of a vanilla feature. 

I could go even further to say that Artifacts as a mechanic are a gimmick and should have never been added to the mod.",They do? The Swords all look different.,You can still use the decision to see who has the VS swords if you want to find them.,"That would actually be pretty neat if the devs could pull it off.

The artifact system has a lot of room for improvement to mitigate the issues I have mentioned, and deep down I hope to see the system   improved in future patches with stuff like your sugestion.",[deleted],"That would make sense if there was only ever the possibility to own a single Valyrian Steel sword. But there isn't. In an insane Ironborn run, are all twenty of my valyrian steel swords integral parts of my character? Does it make sense to have their bonuses stack, as if I can wield dozens of swords all at once in a fight? No, it doesn't. 
The artifact system allows items to be managed both more elegantly and more effectively. I understand you might regard them.as integral traits to a character, but the fact they have their own histories and legends could equally be used to justify having them as artifacts, as they exist beyond any single character.","I took that one step further with my submod by adding specific stats to each sword (stewardship bonuses to Longclaw, martial penalty for Ice, etc.) and adding AI behavior modifiers to a few of them.

Of course now all of that is moot. Stopped working on my mod a few weeks ago because of the coming new patch and most of my work was thrown to the bin now because of core changes to the mechanics. Again.","Just because they are tracked with the same system doesn't mean they are equally important. The lordship of the Stony Shore and the lordship of the North are handled with the same system, yet they have completely different values.","Which makes perfect sense, look at what happened to Ice.",Realistic dosent always mean good,"It's not only them getting stolen, like if my sword is taken by an iron born, I can kill them and get it back, the problem is when the family ""loses"" them during transition, because as far as I know then they are gone forever, you can't get them back, and if this can happen to Valyrian steel swords and/or Dragon eggs, I guarantee you that in a couple of generations in game, none of the great houses will have their ancestral swords.","I am slightly biased, but I am interested to hear what you dislike about the sword graphics. There are 40+ artifact pictures for the Valyrian swords, each has a unique sword and color scheme. Besides your problems with the new artifact system, what do you think would have helped made them look less ""generic""?","Having them hacked in as traits is infinitely more clunky. We were using a system for something it was entirely not meant for, if you do not consider that clunky then that is on you.

Making it use our own system just for the sake of it is ridiculous, the swords are in no way less an interesting feature now that they are artifacts.

The swords are not even a major feature, they provide stat bonuses and have an icon. They are cool because they are true to the lore and make characters more awesome. Not because they were a tiny as hell icon on the trait bar.

Artifacts are just a superior way of representing items instead of them being traits or modifiers.

You seem to just have an odd hate of the artifact system for no apparent reason. Script wise and gameplay wise they are infinitely superior than traits and modifiers to represent any item held by a character. ","Legendary artifacts are still artifacts, the arc of the covenant is an artifact in vanilla for example. The artifact system's goal is to track objects, so not using it for certain objects is pretty odd.","I didn't say they didn't look different, I said they look pretty banal as they are.","~~That's true but then you have to open up the character search to actually look up the character and where they are etc, with the trait icon you can get two birds stoned at once. Also I liked the reforge your sword and getting to choose an icon. From what I see in the artifact it just glows differently.~~","Thank god, then we're good. I always found that system ridiculous. How the hell do you lose a suit of armor, did someone trip?","In the old Trait system for Valyrian Steel you can have multiple swords, and their bonuses don't stack. So I don't see why you mentioned these. 

I don't see how the Artifact system is more effective. It is a DLC mechanic from a very late DLC. Paradox spent much more time and manpower developing the Traits mechanic in the base game. The Artifacts mechanic is less tractable, less transparent, and less stable than the Traits mechanic. The Artifacts mechanic's main justification for existence (that I can think of) is a storage box of unimportant Traits to solve the problem of Trait crowding. 

I think there are Traits less important that Valyrian Steel weapons which should be banished to the Artifacts box first, namely Pets; and Erudite, Scholar, and Mystic which are already represented by Books, Glass Candles, etc. ",Why would a sword have a stewardship bonus? It's a sword.,"Yes but achieving a sword in the game is extremely annoying and grueling to do, depending on *how* you do it. I think just for gameplay purposes and general sanity it shouldn’t be portrayed like that","> the problem is when the family ""loses"" them during transition, because as far as I know then they are gone forever, you can't get them back

I *think* that if you belong to a house that has a lost ancestral sword, you find the lost once instead of the generic one. Even if it is the generic sword you can reforge it as the ancestral afterwards.  

And if it is stolen, then you can declare a war to reclaim it.",Valyrian Steel Swords are indestructible,"[Open Gimp and display all 20 of the new swords in a grid. Trying naming just a few them from the tip of the tongue, based on the lore you know from the swords](https://imgur.com/QHx96e3)

I personally find it difficult, since they all look very similar.

[Now do the same for 20 of the old sword trait icons. I can tell which sword is which based on familiarity with the icons and the fact the trait icons, despite being small, have very distinct features.](https://i.imgur.com/42qWyh9.png)

I understand that there's a certain degree of aesthetics to be followed for artifacts, but if much like the old icons, the artifact icons focused on the details of the hilt, which is the most recognizable part of the sword, it would make them more recognizable. Even changing the orientation of the sword slightly for each one would mitigate the generic feeling they have right now. But traits have the advantage of being on prime UI real estate, right on the character sheet. Artifacts are tucked away on a menu and takes a bit of clicking to reach them.

Now if Artifact Swords gave their holder a trait, I wouldn't mind them too much, but right now it's either one or the other and that I just don't like.","I understand perfectly what you're saying blackninja and that's why I made it clear that my aim wasn't to convince the you or the AGOT team to roll back the change but merely to express my dislike of the transition (and try to draw out some resistance and valuable feedback from those that didn't like the implementation as well). And I tried my best to present my arguments and concerns in a calm articulate manner, despite the fact my entire case could be summed to a childish ""you changed it, now it sucks"" as often happens in many games when there's player feedback involved.

It is clearly obvious that I'm biased against this change, not even going to deny it, but that mostly because my early learning experience with modding CK2 was centered on understanding how you guys coded the swords and how you made the entire thing work. I even started dabbling in pixel art just to make and more detailed icons for my favorite mod feature. Having the feature plucked out kinda took the wind out of my sails for most of my modding efforts.

And this is hardly the first time a change to the mod left me pulling my hair out. This was however the first time I made a big fuss about it, when in the past I would just suck it up and keep lurking Reddit and the forums, while secretly correcting the things I didn't like with save editing and submods. Changes to the customization of coat of arms for R'hllor religion groups, changes in character looks due to portrait tweaking and how you added character modifiers to keep people having insane stats from having multiple Valyrian Steel Swords at the same time (and even I agree it was sort of necessary for game balance). Those were just a few changes I didn't like at the time but eventually grew accustomed.

That aside, as I said before I'm looking forward to see you and the AGOT Team improve even further how Valyrian Swords work in the game. But I personally just don't want to let go of the old system just yet (at least not until I get the hang on how artifacts work fundamentally so I can start tweaking with them in my own games).","Thus why I argued in my reply that the AGOT devs shouldn't have used the artifact system from vanilla in the first place and kept developing the ""Valyrian Steel Swords as traits"" system to include other key items. Like Melisandre's necklace (so that it was the trait that gave her immortality instead of being a forced character flag) for example. Of course anything related to the show makes a few devs furrow their brows, but whatever.

Also, getting the finger bone of St. Peter on one of my games *might* have made me biased against the whole artifact thing, honestly.","Hmm, I googled it, and it seems they changed the system to stop the stacking some time ago. In 2016 I believe. However, up until that point it was very much a real thing, and still serves as an adequate example of the problems with a trait-based system.

The fact that a mechanics is newer doesn't make it somehow inferior. If the trait system was so much better they wouldn't have had any need, desire or player demand to introduce an artifact system, would they? I don't think it's any less stable - there were some bugs and issues, but they patched them, and overall it's far more intuitive than the trait system is.

I really don't agree with you at all there. It seems ludicrous to say that material objects are inherent traits, whereas genuine character traits should be represented through objects. Valyrian steel swords are tangible, quantifiable objects. The fact that someone is well-read and educated is rather less so, don't you think?","Why do swords give Martial skills when it is already established that Martial represents the ability to lead armies in battle when there's already a stat that describes the advantage the sword gives in hand-to-hand combat (dueling skill)?

Quite frankly I threw that example because I was toying with the idea of transforming the swords into ""stat sticks"" that made characters better in some areas and worse in others. I removed the innate Martial bonus all swords had (that the Devs added as an opinion modifier to nerf multiple sword ownership shenanigans), and gave them a 2 bonus / 2 penalty to a stat based on the story and background of the sword's past owners. Stewardship was the stat I picked for Longclaw, adding an Intrigue penalty to the owner. John's Longclaw gave one of Stewardship and Diplomacy and kept the intrigue penalty. Even if a character owned multiple swords, it would be mean the bonuses and penalties would mitigate the advantage of having multiple swords with my change.

But why did I  do it? Because of flavor. No other reason. I also gave AI_Honor as an hidden stat to a few swords just to make sure their owners acted in a certain way. Dawn became fitting in the hands of NPCs once I jacked its AI modifiers.
","While that's true, this is a double edged valyrian steel sword (hehe), since it's also become easier to obtain one, since you can take them from slain foes.","His concern is not that the swords are indestructible, but that in the old system the swords were always tied for a particular dynasty, which gave any house a proper causus belli to get back their ancestral sword. But apparently there is a chance for the systems behind this chair dance of artifact ownership to fail and make an artifact disappear in limbo.

Quite frankly I haven't had the time to muck with the new code for this patch so I can't tell what safeguards the Devs put in place to ensure any given house always has a claim to their ancestral sword and what happens if by chance the sword ceases to be. 

For example here were a few swords that had the chance of reappearing if the player completed the Fashbinder quest for a sword or by a decision. Like finding Brightroar or reforging Ice from Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper.","As I've already said, if you want to make us new icons go ahead! We would love more detailed an in depth art for the artifact icons.

There is an icon on the portrait of people with the swords.","I am not saying you are wrong for disliking the change, that is your opinion on the matter. What I am saying you are wrong for is your reasoning that it is more clunky, that is objectively not true. Hacking traits to be items when they are not is much more of a clunky method.

Artifacts work pretty much like traits really.

Except they have many advantages in that they are an actual scope with a full range of options unlike traits which we had to cache to make them scopeable but even then the would only scope to the character and not the actual traits.

For example we can make artifacts have flags attached to them so as to assign them specific information as well as change the name and description of them meaning you can now enter a custom description and name for your reforged valyrian sword without having to go into the mod files and do the name before you start playing.

It also means that you can interact with said swords in other means for displaying the history of their owners (albeit that is kinda bugged right now hence there is still the traits on the dead characters) as well as sell them or any other interaction we eventually want to add.

This opens up far more potential cool things to do with them and also vastly simplifies any script work.","But that would either cause a lot of clutter in the already cluttered trait bar, or make it so that only major items are accounted for, which are both pretty poor options.

The artifact systems allows the devs to account for a bunch of in-universe objects without hiding them in flags or cluttering the trait or modifier bar. Books, lesser quality swords and weapons, glass candles, crowns, etc...

Without it, the game considered Jaime Lannister to be fighting with the same quality equipment as whatever random lowborn riverlands commander he's dueling, just because neither own Valyrian steel.

Also, the artifact system allows for a character to own an item without being able to use it, which is pretty cool and makes sense. It also has a built-in feature to prevent stacking equipment bonuses.

> Also, getting the finger bone of St. Peter on one of my games might have made me biased against the whole artifact thing, honestly.

If that's what really has you in arms against the artifact system in general, then I'm sorry, that's pretty ridiculous. That's just the devs accidentally overlooking a vanilla aspect instead of removing it or adapting it to the mod. Judging the mechanic itself for that makes no sense.","> Why do swords give Martial skills when it is already established that Martial represents the ability to lead armies in battle when there's already a stat that describes the advantage the sword gives in hand-to-hand combat 

You can rationalize that by saying that having a commander with a Valyrian steel sword makes them seem more impressive and therefore boosts morale. 

You can't do that with stats like Stewardship though, unless you think Longlaw has multiplication tables chiseled into its hilt.","Indestructible means it cannot be destroyed like that in succession.

The CBs still work perfectly fine. If anything they are now better as artifacts can have flags to indicate dynasty owners of it whereas traits could do no such thing.

There are a lot safe guards.","Multiplication tables that make you worse at court intrigue of course.

In the base game if you control all the holy sites of your pagan religion you can choose to reform it and customize the religion by adding perks. Since the mod doesn't have pagan religions the new feature won't have any effect.

Similarly the crusade mechanics in the base game were changed by allowing different rulers to contribute to a war chest and selecting the designated recipient of the targeted lands for the crusade.

I pressed ducal claims.  Expanded until I could form kingdom of Dragonstone.  Then finished off the crown lands and started expanding through the other three kingdoms simultaneously.  I got a Targ branch in the North and left them alone and Dorne had been taken over by Myr, who were on their way to forming New Valyria, so I left them alone.

One of the more fun games I've played  Its was like playing vanilla with a god general.",because how much different would it be than aegon's conquest besides playing as a different character ,Could change RPing a bit if it's a different character..?,Unfortunately that would require a new map as the ck2 engine does not support dynamic map changes in that way,"After the doom would be an interesting bookmark, especially if you filled in the gaps with new interesting characters.",So if you played in westeros would you be the First Men?,I dont know what you mean? it would include essos and westeros just like the normal map the only diffrence is that in the early bookmarks valyria would be owned by the free-hold and later in the bookmarks it would be ruins instead of wasteland. Because there is already a sub-mod that does that to valyria on the nexus for ck2 i believe,"Yeah, if you have any modding experince and are intrested in helping im gonna start trying to plan out the sub-mod now to get ready for agot updating to horselords","Would love that too! Already asked this myself once, hoping for a bookmark including Gorgossos and the last Valyrian Dragonrider in Qohor. But the info about the dynasties at that time was to sparse for the modders (They already have enough work with the current dates)
","Yea, the south would be first men so pretty much everything south of the neck and then maybe the neck but the north was mostly giants and children of the forest both of which already have models","No, the Andals came about 6000 years ago, and the Valyrian Freehold fell about 600 years ago","The entire Valyrian Peninsula would be different, it would not be blown up into lots of smaller islands it would be one larger landmass, hence a different map needed.","Your best bet would be to create ""The Century of Blood"", with the action commencing immediately after the doom. The Dothraki would be much smaller, and kingdoms such as Essaria, Sarnor, and Shazhazdhan. The much smaller extent would be very interesting to see. 

You can't do anything before 7900 really - it's not possible to show the geographical changes on the same map. The Andal conquest and the migration of the Rhoynar to Dorne happened long before that, so you can't show it.","I'm not experienced in modding, but if i could help you as (bloody) amateur, feel free to ask!","Oh, i thought there were still some of the COTF and First men in the north :/","There's a mod that does this already, I love it. It's not that new either, why couldn't they just contact the author and appropriate it?",But wouldn't it still be a fractured mess AFTER the Doom? Therefore no need to change the map structure at all,It would require minor editing of the valyria region right?,"Because it only does it for the current bookmakrs, it doesn't have anything before the Bleeding Years which is what this guy asks for. It still doesn't solve the whole we would need to versions of the mod part and the immense work in creating from scratch like 5 generations of rulers for every single county",He says fall of valyria but mentions the andal invasion which took place before the fall of valyria,"Some pretty serious editing, actually. But what people are arguing is that, if you do that, you then have to make the Doom of Valyria your end date. In 7900 there's a massive change in physical geography in Essos and you either have to set your submod before it or after it. If you try both then there will be a period where your physical map is wildly inaccurate for the period.",Yeah. this would take place before Valyria was shattered into the all the islands so i guess i would have to change valyria a little bit but the biggest challenge would be designing all  the titles and the internal politics of the free-hold,"To clarify: Crusader Kings II does not support changing the map via bookmarks or anything other than mods. If you had a submod to restore the Valyrian subcontinent to the Pre-Doom phase, it would exist in that form during every bookmark, and there would be no way to make it work differently in different bookmarks. It just isn't possible.",I remember seeing an Alec Trevelyan somewhere in Dorne. Awesome Sean Bean reference right thar.,"If I recall, there's also a few men named Elwood in the Roxton Lord of the Ring line, which, in my mind, is a cut down Elijah Wood. ",If you go into the history of the LP's of the riverlands there are some named after the Muppets.,"""As one of the Maiar, Sauron was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur.[6] At the beginning of Time, he was amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[3] Here he became one of the Maiar of Aulë,[3] and was known as Mairon.[4] However, he was soon ensnared by Melkor and became his greatest and most trusted servant.[1] Thus he came to be known as Gorthaur by the Sindar of Beleriand and Sauron by others.[2]""

For those who didn't get the full reference",nice lol I'm sure there must be a few scattered about the place ,"just checked and while u can't play as Melkor or Mairon, Saron is a playable character",and he has a valyrian steel sword called orphan maker,was wondering if there would be a frodo anywhere in the line of succession :P ,"There in the world of ice and fire book as well, it mentions two named Elmo and Kermit","Sorry, but this is really a stupid post that just sounds like bitching to me.

1: in this game you can win wars by killing the claimant it's based on.

2: if you capture the head white walker, you win. It's always been that way. It's how the game works.

3: bumrush the capital with your doomstacks, what they did in the show, is the go to ai move in this game. Its also what gives the most war score.

They aren't going to create an event where if the walkers bumrush Winterfell while faceless trained Arya is there they auto lose.","You can turn their difficulty up already, which unless you have very good defenses or a dragon or you can organize an attack/war for the dawn before the wall falls, is usually pretty damn tough, so I really dont get this post.",Bitching confirmed.,Never mention the next mod in a post. Just sit back and enjoy the screenshots. ,Turn off Holy Fury and regress your game to the 2.8.3.4 beta in order to play the AGOT mod,"Jesus Christ does this question need to be asked every day?
SEARCH!","Yeah cheers for that. I kindof figured I might have to do something like that, but wasn’t really sure.

Thanks for the response ","Jesus Christ, seems like it would be easier just to scroll past",Haha OK someone answered.  People rather loose their stuff than to just be nice and answer.,With only about 5 posts per day on this sub and this question making up at least one of those posts it'd be easier for you to spend 12 seconds scrolling through the sub than asking this question,Not when every third post is asking the same damn questions.,"I dunno, seems to me that 9 posts out of 10 are just screenshots from people’s games.

A thousand pardons are humbly requested for asking a question about the setup of my game. I didn’t realise there was a limit to what people can ask.

I’ll know better in the future.","Yeah what do you think this is, a forum? Fuck you for making a post game related.",I never get this one anymore. Ive only gotten the Valyrian  Ruins Armor one for the past 10 times.,"One crow, one dog, one eagle. Order shouldn't matter IIRC. ","Crow, dog, eagle - simple plus and minus math problem.","It's easy.
Just see what animals stayed alive (bad english probably).",The new quest is great/the worst.,That’s my recipe for three penis wine. ,"Okay, thanks!","It's a lot more tense, I like it","Well, you have to keep in mind that this was sort of an update for April Fools. It runs, obviously, but they're still polishing everything up for a proper release that we'll probably see in a few weeks. I'd expect the kinks to be ironed out then. Northerners are able to have blonde hair now, but the DNA strings weren't double checked—hence things like the blonde Greatjon.","Wait, valyrian swords/armor aren't artifacts?  Are they not making use of 2.7 or monks and mystics at all?","Northerners can be blonde in the lore, thing is none of the dna got updated for characters who are now all suddenly blonde.

The valyrian swords have been said about many times, once we get the ability to see the history of an artifact they will be made artifacts.

Where would you want the new portraits to be used for...?","Oh, good to know. Crashing like crazy with this new update.","They are, but it is oviously under dev. There are Targaryen Kings crowns, Robert's Greathammer and Forrester Greatsword, from what i've heard.",I mean other than all the other artifacts and societies we added in no not at all,"I understand, modding must be very troublesome and must work hard a lot. I thought was official. 
The new gfxs? Idk, maybe on the westernlands or stormlands, they'd look nice in the new english and german portraits. Idk, what about a shot? if you guys, the owners don't like. It's up to you. Just hope this game get the best of all. By the way, great work at not following the HBO stories. Keep true to George Martin.","I've been having some frequent crashes too. Sometimes I can play for 10-15 years with no problems, and sometimes it crashes within 2-3. I like to play with Dark World Reborn on top of it too though, so that's probably a reason for some of my instability.","Yeah, hard not to blame it on the submod when most of them probably aren't compatible yet (not sure about Dark World Reborn). My games go usually 30 years sometimes more and then I get a CTD at a certain date. Which at first isn't obvious but every time I reload it crashes at the same date.","Yeah, I'm suffering without my GOT mods right now, especially Congenital Overhaul. Dark World adds a lot of shit, it wasn't designed for GOT but it'll run with it. 

30 years? Props, I usually get bored within 10-15. I like playing as Targs and Blackfyres, so it's usually fairly easily to accomplish your goals... even with Daenerys. My last game with Dany fell apart when Young Griff died in battle before they had any heirs, and Jon Snow had died some disease. My longest game was probably as my custom Blackfyre where I formed New Valyria, ruling from Ny Sar. But even then, it was probably 20-25 years tops.","> I usually get bored within 10-15

Wow really? That's hardly enough time for me to get started... If I wasn't crashing at ~30 years my games would go usually to 200+ years.","Yeah. I usually play the Clash of Kings scenario, occasionally Storm of Swords. For some reason I get bored once the chaos starts to settle down. Or I get bored when things come to me too easily. I quit a Dance of Dragons campaign when I won as Rhaenyra within the year.",That's interesting. I'd never even considered that people would be playing such short games. Different strokes I suppose.,"R5: For some bizarre reason every time I start a Redwyne playthrough Joffrey is replaced with a 32 year old named Jarmyn who has no family. The guy also executes one of my kids (held hostage) within 10 days of the game starting. This only happens in my Redwyne playthroughs.
I'd really like to be Lord Paramount of the Reach starting off as Redwyne but this does not seem possible when dear old Jarmyn executes one of my sons while I'm trying to get him married to the Lannisters. Also, my lore intensive mind hurts.
Is this a joke? Is it intentional?",Are you playing on a mac?,https://i.imgur.com/6B7Clf7.jpg,Yeah.,"I get it, my logic isn't spectacular. Instead of just being a cunt about it, please help.","That's a common issue on Mac. I've had it myself. What you gotta do is select a date, then go back to the menu, then return to the selected date. You'll get your missing characters back.","If you're running on steam, you can capture the screen by pressing F12. Also there should be a button called print screen on your key board, it may be shortened to print scrn etc. if you press that, it'll copy the image to your clipboard, and then you just paste it into an image editor like paint, and save it",Thanks!,I'll do that.,You got it,What would be the basis for these?,whats up with these downvotes?,"I think he's talking about the parentage. The second most popular theory as to Jon's parentage is that he's the son of Ned with Ashara Dayne, who Ned was supposedly in love with before he marries Cat. 
As for R+L=D, I have never heard that theory","oh do you mean Jons claim on starfall? and dany's on winterfell? Well based off the dayne family tree http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Dayne 
Edric has no male heir thats close to the family Darkstar is so different hes considerd part of a cadet branch of the family so Jon being the bastard (or trueborn they could have had a secret marrige) would make him heir to starfall 

And dany well albeit she would have a much weaker claim probably being behind Jon, Robb, Bran, Rickon, Sansa, and  Arya she would still get a claim though via lyanna so probably a weak claim would better for dany ",People get sensitive when you suggest something besides R+L=J,"R+L=D was pretty popular a while ago and then it like died out of no where lol but watch the playlist of videos I put in the post  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCsx_OFEYH6un7-8efHOg-UL5WdQ9gLSN 

It has some pretty awesome points to it ","Maybe it's refering to him just loafing around with other boys too much during training, and focusing on the wrong type of ""swordplay.""",Stick 'em with the pointy end.,"Playing devil's advocate, maybe the devs meant for less of a ""daddy issues"" subtext to the event than a ""Greek camaraderie with the other squires"" thing.","He likes to ""stab"" the other kids ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ",Why on earth would it be taken out?,Whats so wrong about handling your dad's powerful sword?,If it makes you feel any better you can assume your kid was always that way but you just never noticed.,"Context: Started as Rhaegar in Bobby's Rebellion and won. I've had a ton of kids and have started training them.

After forcing my youngest son, Aemon, to train, I got this event... Sword fighting with his dad made him gay. 

Possible homophobia aside, this kind of just doesn't make any sense?",Anal swordplay?,"Maybe it should be changed to hedonist? That seems to make sense more to me as a hedonist in the game seems to just be someone that likes pleasures and doesn't adhere to social norms but isn't necessarily gay, like Oberyn and Theon",HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,"I saw a mini mod somewhere that added a send to brothel decision that had a chance to un-gay your kids, perhaps that should just be added to the main mod.",This pretty much^,It should have at least made him a skilled fighter too :(,"It's a negative to forcing your kids to train, it basically randomizes a negative effect from a pool if it fails.

Usually your kid gets maimed, so I guess you're lucky.

Can't really see why it doesn't make sense either, getting sweaty with other men every day is probably a pretty common way to turn someone gay.","Honestly, yeah, a bit inappropriate. ","Holy shiiit, that would just make it worse.","Well, popular modern thinking says being gay isn't a choice, so it's not really something you can become.

But in CK2 homosexual is already a trait that can be learned as a child, so it's consistent with the game's established mechanics. So I can see either side.",Oh boy. Why don't you start wrestling and come back when you turn gay?,"I guess the ""swordplay"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) made him come out of the closet. Fuck if I know, ask Renly.",Who said it was a choice?,"Well the event turns the son gay. Maybe he didn't choose, but he became gay because of the training, which isn't how that works. 

Not that it's a huge deal or anything.","I kinda did the same thing with jon except i had viserion tamed from the beggining. took over all of westeros because for some reason stannis turned on me. but then i made all the lord paramounts starks and gave them all dragon eggs and most of them have dragons. 

now about 30 years after jon died as king his second son Qhorin is king (since eddard my first son died of a sickness) and he and his younger brother Robb had a civil war that made the dance of dragons look like childs play. so much fun!",im glad that i dont use commands then it feels more like game of thrones when one mistake can cost you life,that sounds really cool! what's the console command you speak of?,"Oh god, I was wondering why  couldnt win the war as Jon. I never realized you have to win the Stormlands back. I did something similar but instead of starting affc I started at acok and played as Robb. Won the war and married Dany. She gave me a dragon and then used console to ride it (if GRRM could make it happen, so could I). I became a dragon riding stark and took the Iron throne for Dany, but she died right after i took it because she build New Ghis. Best stark playthrough EVER",Yup everyone has their own preferred playstyle. I just use it in those must have situations. But not always :D,event dragon.14 I believe. ,Yeah I only found out because I console command took control of Stannis to see what was wrong. So in case your liege will not enforce demand I suggest to quickly control him/her to see what the problem is. It was also a bit strange since those were two seperate wars lol,thank you! ,I don't get it?,"Are you using a portrait pack of some kind? If so, which?

I certainly don't have anyone who looks like that in my game, and would very much like to.","Dragon -> Drag-in -> In drag. 

Verion is titled ""Prince,"" but has a very feminine appearance. ","Ikr, she doesn't look like she has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.","Think that's the mediterrean pack, unsure though.",He's had his days now he's a wrinkled old man lmao.,Very good.,"""Prince of Dorne""",It's the Persian one,"ew nevermind  
  
Actually, you know what. He's is pretty hot, who am i to judge? I'd do him.","I know you said you don't have time to read the books, but the World of Ice and Fire is more an encyclopedia than a novel. It's got all of the regions of the world in it's own section, as well as the history of the Targaryen kings, the long night, Valyria, etc. and it details all of the cultures of the world, too. Sounds like something you might want!","I don't understand, what's the appeal if you don't know the lore? Why not play the base game?",Not really.  Just play the game and don't play the affc or wot5k scenarios. ,why don't you just watch the show?,"I might have just the right thing for you. I make [Game of Thrones recap videos](https://youtu.be/V8_EDyHk5UY?list=PLNBXP53gUEb_8kg6DQ23YD3KMlp-Tnelz). If you were to watch Seasons 1 & 2, that would get you pretty well educated about the basics for the the War of the 5 Kings Scenario in the mod, without spoiling where things go after that. ","Do you have any downtime in your day? A commute to work, housework, dishes, making dinner, etc? If so I highly recommend listening to the audiobooks. I listened to all 5, it was a fantastic experience and it made my commute a treat.","Anything you will look at will have spoilers I mean that is the nature of researching a fantasy world. 

If you eventually plan on reading the books or watching the show then do not play any bookmark from after the Greyjoy Rebellion and make sure to have the Dance of Dragons Spoiler Remover game rule turned on.

Then play basically any other bookmark and you should be fine, it will contain spoilers but only for the extended stuff that is not part of the main series of books. So if you play in the Rogue Prince it will spoil details there but that has not impact on a spoiler from A Clash of Kings etc.

In the manual is says what bookmarks spoil what exactly which should help you.

As for actual research the World of Ice and Fire alongside the wiki are your best bets.","It won't be the same if you haven't read or even seen aGoT. Trust me, I speak from experience, you have little to no connections with the characters.","The books and lore are pretty big, but if you read through awoiaf on major events, you'd be able to piece the universe together as if you read the books.",Just read the Wiki on the subjects that you want. And be mindful of spoilers.,I'm guessing you never looked the the in-universe dedication written by the maester did you. The name the book is being written for has been scratched over. Twice. Major spoilers there.,"Unless you can think of a fantasy ck2 mod that's as well made, in depth, and unique, I'm gonna keep playing this one.

Also it's just a really neat universe from what I've learned so far.",I literally just said I don't have the time to do it.,"Oh that's perfect!

Thanks dood","Holy shit I didn't know it had audiobooks!

Ok that's exactly what I'm gonna do before I play the mod again. Thanks!","Yeah, I have, it just slipped my mind. Guess that's sort of a deal breaker, huh?","Though I prefer AGoT and don't play anything else, from what I've seen of the Warhammer mod, it's really good. It's got a bunch of neat traits, magic and story, but doesn't match the AGoT mod and universe IMO. Elder Kings is really good too, but again isn't as good IMO, and I don't think it's updated to the newest version yet.","The mod is based on the books anyways, so if you watch the show it still won't really help. But the way I did it, before I got ahold of the books, was read through a little bit of AWOIAF every day and gradually learn more. I'd recommend you'd just read the following subjects.

The Targaryen kings

The Blackfyre rebellions

The dance of dragons

Roberts rebellion

And if you suddenly don't mind spoilers, just read what happens to the POV characters","you said you didn't have time to read the books.  it's a lot less time to watch the show.  at any rate playing the game takes up many hours anyway, why don't you play Pac-man and save yourself some time?",If you don't have time to watch you damn well dont have enough time to play ck2,No problem. Just note that the books are incredibly long! It took me months to listen to them all. ,"Oh God, I freaking LOVE Elder Kings, and I'm pretty sure a few weeks ago the had a massive, *massive* update. Still not nearly as fleshed out as AGoT, but holy crap.",That's a pretty good list. I just want to add that reading about Aegon the Conqueror specifically will give a ton of good background info without any book/show spoilers.,"Thanks. That's kinda what I've been doing myself. When I learned who the POV people were, I avoided them at all costs.","Did you just insult me?

Why did you just insult me?

I'm just trying to learn a little bit here, man.",Really? I may look into this update. I haven't played in so long because I didn't like switching back and forth between versions of CK2.,"I'm not insulting you, just kind of making a joke, but I will point out that this is a time consuming game, you could easily use half that time to catch up on the lore.  not only that, but the more you know, the better the game is","Yeah they finally updated it to the current ck2 versions, it is quite good","Yeah, I only got it after this update, but there's art for every race, virtually every religion that's ever existed in-universe, a class system (spellsword, nightblade, etc.), the ability to join guilds.

Still a bit buggy and there are quite a few things that_are_written_likethis because they haven't fleshed those out yet, but it's only a matter of time before they're fixed.",Thanks for letting me know!,That feel when you have no artists ,"Ikr. Well for me it's no artist, and the coding capabilities of a mountain man that hasn't been around society since he quit his job as a printer repairman in 2004.

I'd really like to see a Dune mod, but all I've got is creativity and the drive to *help* someone make it, but not actually make it myself.",Oh and your mod is amazing and you should feel amazing for being a dev of it,"Yeah doing a total overhaul as a starting for modding is very hard, but starting small and working up using the ck2 wiki for modding help is a good start",Yes he should.,"Has there ever been a bastard more fit for the Wall? He doesn't even need no education.

Right? Right?","Er, what am I missing here?",His coat of arms is a pyramid with a white beam going in one side and a rainbow coming out the other.,Love this ,The name... Pink Floyd? ,Roger Waters,"Yeah, I didn't get it either. I had to look up what ""Pink Floyd was."" I think it was before my time though.","Yeah, before my time.","You may be surprised to hear this, OP, but not everyone listens to the same bands.

>__George Roger Waters__ (born 6 September 1943) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the [progressive rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock) band [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd) with drummer [Nick Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mason), keyboardist [Richard Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(musician\)) and guitarist, singer and songwriter [Syd Barrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Barrett). Waters initially served as the group's bassist and co-lead vocalist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist and conceptual leader.

>Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the [concept albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album) *[The Dark Side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon)*, *[Wish You Were Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album\))*, *[Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_(Pink_Floyd_album\))*, *[The Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall)* and *[The Final Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Cut_(album\))*. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; as of 2013, they have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million units sold in the United States. Amid creative differences within the group, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their intended use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years had passed before he performed with them again.

>Waters' solo career has included three studio albums: *[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pros_and_Cons_of_Hitch_Hiking)*, *[Radio K.A.O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_K.A.O.S.)* and *[Amused to Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amused_to_Death)*. In 1990, he staged one of the largest and most extravagant rock concerts in history, *[The Wall – Live in Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_%E2%80%93_Live_in_Berlin)*, with an official attendance of 200,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame) in 1996 and the [UK Music Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Music_Hall_of_Fame) in 2005. That same year he released *Ça Ira*, an [opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera) in three acts translated from [Étienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Roda-Gil) and Nadine Roda-Gils' [libretto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libretto) about the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution). Later that year, he reunited with Pink Floyd bandmates Mason, Wright and [David Gilmour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gilmour) for the [Live 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_8) global awareness event; it was the group's first appearance with Waters since 1981. He has toured extensively as a solo act since 1999 and played *The Dark Side of the Moon* in its entirety for his [world tour of 2006–2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon_Live). In 2010, he began [The Wall Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Live_(concert_tour\)) and in 2011 Gilmour and Mason appeared with him during a performance of the double album in London. As of 2013, the tour is the [highest-grossing of all time by a solo artist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_concert_tours).

As it is still a historical game just for the game of thrones world, it has more depth in characters and event chains than any of the vanilla ones. 

Many many many more features which are all listed inside the manual that comes when you install it.

Honestly I do not really get what you want to hear from this question, download it yourself it is free after all. Just play it yourself and read the manual that comes with it to get a more in depth look at all the mechanics etc we have added as listing them here would be far too much.","I've played CK and CK2 from the beginning, GOT isn't merely a mod, it's a total conversion. So many new traits, new religions, new government types, CBs, etc. it feels like a different game on the same engine. 

Pirate conquests, the Ironborn, dragon conquest, warlocks, depending on who you play as it's an entirely different game, whereas the base CK2 game is fairly consistent regardless of if you're Orthodox or Catholic. ","On the other hand, after starting with the mod and going back to regular CK2, there's a few things I do like better about the base game.      

1. Retinues and usage of combat mechanics. Between the ability to customize your army composition, only having one or two combat traits, and having different cultural unit buildings for each faction, you can absolutely feel the difference in combat between different regions in the vanilla game. In GoT, you're much more reliant on going in with a 30 martial commander with inspiring leader or whatever and trying to win duels in battle. It would be much cooler imo if different regions in Westeros had different army comps and building choices. Like in Dorne you might be able to build a harass/swarm army with light infantry and horse archers but the Ironborn would get a heavy infantry centric army.      

2. Religion. Obviously, the medieval world was much more focused on religion than the people of GoT, so it makes sense from a design standpoint to dampen its impact. Nevertheless, some of the most fun aspects in the base game have to deal with crusades, excommunication, pilgrimages, and other religious events that don't transfer over to GoT. Fwiw, it is fun to do stuff like use the ""event red_priest.1"" command to make yourself Rh'llor and try to convert Westeros.   

3. Randomness. The base game is designed by paid professionals who have spent thousands of man-hours putting in little flavor events everywhere. Some playthroughs you get a little demon child that conquers North Africa for the Lombards. In others, the Mongols manage to completely annihilate the Byzantines and are on your doorstep by 1200. It also helps that the world of medieval Europe was much more interconnected than the GoT continents. In the GoT world, after your specific scenario events are over, it's a lot more stable. I have never seen Essos rulers invading Westeros or vice versa. The Summer Islanders stay the Summer Islanders forever. In general, you'll most likely be playing quicker, more compact playthroughs in GoT.","'Cause vanilla don't have dragons :P, seriously, would love to take Balerion against the golden horde and f*ck their (non-attrition doom-stacked) asses back to Mongolia

But really, the GoT lore and events are worth it (if you're a fan). It's amazing how much it expands your knowleged of George's world and characters so completely. I have a friend who has read the books multiple times be dumbfounded how I know so much about the geography and family histories...that's because I've replayed and lived those histories several times over from all sides possible, thanks to u/blackninja9939 (the greatest mod. dev. alive ;) )","Tame Dragons and burn armies and cities. 

Burn nobles in magic rituals to improve your own health, knowledge, and power. 

Valyrian Steel swords. Wildfire. 

Basically just creatively burn things. Embrace your inner pyromaniac. ",I don't see why you would play the mod if you don't know anything about GOT though ,Hodor.,"Honestly if you're not into game of thrones just get the ck2+ mod, it's got most of the cool features the GoT mod has without the complete game overhaul the HIP mod gives.",Hodor.,"havent even notices the manuel lol, but thanks for the notice! 

It took some time to learn CK2, just wanted to know if it would be like starting all over learning the game.. Guess im starting reading that manual then!

In vanilla the major bookmarks are mostly just individual wars with no real events with them, but with our bookmarks when you start up you have events to show what happened in the lore for those events.

Say if you start in Robert's Rebellion and you win then you have to fight in the Tower of Joy. If you play as Robb in ACOK you get choices of who to marry (Jeyne or Freys) and the outcome of that along with events if Theon goes to Winterfell etc. That is just two scenarios out of the many lore based ones we have not including non-bookmark start dates.","Oh yeah, one thing to mention is that the mod is based off the books rather than the show.","Rajahs of India never interested me. Maybe it's bigotry but I never cared to play anything east of zoroastrians in Persia. 

GOT is different. Each religion, each region has its perks and disadvantages. Play a wildling or a pirate and literally everyone else hates you, but you have abilities that nobody else has. ","Ah okay. At first I wasn't really sure what to do in the mod to enjoy it. I found myself just taking the IT as Aegon or something then getting bored. Then I discovered you gotta play it a little differently than vanilla. 

I found that picking a house and then playing for hundreds of years making sure your dynasty is strong is very fun. For example, last playthrough I made a custom Stark ruler and my goal wasn't to conquer so much as just stay independent from the Throne and make sure my family stays prestigious, I'm trying to think of a good way to put it but you can kinda catch my meaning. It's a more idle style of playing but you focus more on having strong children and keeping your own kingdom/house stable. As I did I really enjoyed watching drama unfold in Westeros: for example, the Lannisters and Baratheons rebelled far too many times for the Targa to be okay with it and ended with the Kennings as LPs of the Westerlands and Esteemonte for the Stormlands. Since my sister was married to Baratheon I helped them take back their seat at Storms end. The Targ King wasn't very happy but it was their rightful place. Stuff like that made me enjoy the mod.

Eventually I took over the riverlands through mostly peaceful means. The Tully's went mental and started doing weird shit so they needed to be taken out lest they harm House Frey. 

During the history of the House one Frey stood out among the rest. I can't remember his name but I want to say it was something like Stevron. He was an absolute badass. Strong, formidable fighter, brave (I think) and wielding the valyrian greatsword Two Towers. He fought countless duels and won every single one. Legit badass.","I nearly wiped out the Corbrays in my current Andal Invasion run with a custom house from Maidenpool.

Here's the story: 
I started my way up the Great House Lasser by conquering forcing the vassalisation of the small lords sorrounding the Bay of Crabs. Everything went smoth until whatshisname Corbray declared a war against my ""Tyranny"", I won the war, sacked their capital and took Lady Forlorn as Loot from the Siege. The fuckers send Corbray after Corbray to duel me for the sword. My ruler, Ryon Redhorn being the badass he was left a mountain of dead Corbrays in the spawn of 5-10 years. I managed to save the dynasty by marrying one of my bastards matrilinearly because the last Corbray only had daughters. The suicidal maniacs haven't come for Lady Forlorn in 100 years or so.

The only thing I don't like about me having the sword is that the Valyrian steel reforge event isn't available. Maybe at some point I'll return it if they haven't been wiped out yet. 
","In my most recent game, I played as Jamie Lannister, starting just after the 'deposition' of the Mad King,  Aerys II Targaryen. Jamie did not serve as a member of the Knightsguard through Tywin's political acumen (Console commands), he was granted Lordship of Castamere. Thus his official foray into the Game of Thrones began. However, he was still present and was the eventual remedy to Aerys madness.

The Kingslayer ruled his land justly, he was married to Janna Tyrell, likely the Old Lions or the Queen of Thorn's ploy to lay claim to the others lands. Jamie, the Young Lion cared little for these games and continued to rule almost peacefully. His wife Janna gave him many children over the course of their marriage and it soon turned to love. Riddled with guilt, he broke off his relationship with his twin and devoted himself to his dear wife. Their eldest child, Loven would become the heir of Jamie's titles.

His lover Cersei, married the Usurper, Robert Baratheon bearing three children in quick succession, the first, Steven had suspiciously blonde hair for a Stag. The second died at birth and their daughter Cassana, a beautiful child with a golden mane. In time she gave him another son Adam, a Strong, Brave lad with dark hair.

Jamie, growing bored of governing his lands during peace came across an old man with spins his tales of Valyria, which spurs the Young Lion into heading East Across the Sea in search of fame. Several months go past without any word of Lord of Castamere. Eventually, he returns scarred and more grizzled than before. He did not return empty-handed from his voyage. He told stories to his children of the crossing of the Narrow Sea and of the old Valyrian Tombs, The dragon skulls and the mysterious trials he took with his new Commander Gerion.

Sometime after Lions return, rumours began to circulate of the legitimacy of the Heir to the Iron Throne and Cersei was thrown into the dungeons. She pleaded for the Kingslayer to fight for her in a trial by combat against the Demon of Trident, The King of the Iron Throne, Robert Baratheon.

The battle was quick and decisive, Robert had grown fatter, his swings lacked the strength they once had when he caved in the Silver Prince, Rhaegar's breastplate. The Young Lion roared, as he sunk the Valyrian Blade, Brightroar into the King's chest. Jamie had slain another, the moniker Kingslayer more apt than ever.

Cersei was free from the King's rule and returned to see Tywin's last year on Westeros. Jamie became the warden of the West for the new King Steven ""Baratheon"". Cersei was married to the Hound, Sandor Clegane for his years of loyal service and the two quickly produced the Hounds only pup, Helena Clegane.

Some more time passed and a plot to kill Janna went uncovered and the Lord Paramount of the Westerlands wife died. The King had her poisoned, once again the Lion bared his fangs at another so-called King. He raised his levies and marched across the Westerlands and slaughtered his bastard son, once again slaying another ""King"".

Having had enough of the madness that the Iron Throne spread, he declared the Westerlands their own Kingdom and The Kingdom of the Rock was formed.

His son had come of age and ran away with one of his distant cousins, a young Lannister from Lannisport. King Jamie, granted his brother Tyrion the High Lordship of Castamere, due to his continued hard work and excellent work as Hand of the King. This is where the trouble began, over the years of the greedy, unfit, members of the Lannister Pride had come knocking, requesting gifts and titles, to which the King refused, granting him an almost tyrannical reputation.

The Hyenas came and waged war on the Lion, he continued to lead his army, slaying his own kin and former vassals. The Lion was hard pressed and could only hold back the tides for so long before the once great Army of the Rock had eroded to next to nothing whilst they tore at the Gates of Casterly Rock. Eventually, they forced him to concede, not before Slaying the ageing Moutain that Rides in a duel. The Lion roared for the last time before his Uncle Kevan seized the Throne and sent Jamie to the Wall.

​

**TL;DR -** Jamie kills three kings, before becoming a Tyrant King of the Rock and being deposed by his much older Uncle, Kevan Lannister.",No they are not. Aerion Brightflame died from drinking wildfire. Aegon the fifth died in the fire at Summerhall. Viserys died from molten gold on his head.

It's set fourteen years before the books and show begin, so there are a lot of familiar characters, but the story will diverge long before it reaches the ""present day"".

For your other question, the two War of the Five Kings starts are both named after the books they correspond to. Loosely speaking:

* A Clash of Kings is set immediately after the Season One finale, but has some scripted events that would spoil early events in Season Two.
* A Feast For Crows is set immediately after the Season Four finale, but has some scripted events that would spoil early events in Season Five.","Read the manual, it says what scenarios provide spoiler for which books and which show seasons.","if you poke around, you will find spoilers no matter when you start, because there are things from the past that are in the story...just finish watching, then read the books, because that's what the game is really based on

Whilst theoretically feasible to a degree it would be nigh on impossible to have everything follow canon.

Also why would you want it to? This is Crusader Kings 2 with AGOT flavour not AGOT the simulator. If you want a complete historical reenactment of the events well just read the books again or watch the show up to the point before it starts to deviate too far from the lore to your liking. ","In the case of the Starks, you could start in the Crowned Stag, pollinate around the same year each Stark in canon is born, reload every time Cat has a kid of the wrong gender until you get the same order of the Starks, name them Sansa, Arya, Bran, Rickon, then give them direwolves in the console.","I was mostly just concerned with the major stuff, I suppose. Starks and Dany getting their pets, Robb and Joffrey getting killed at their weddings.

It's mostly to make various ""what if"" scenarios a bit more feasible. If you start too early half the characters won't even be born. If you start to late, they're all already dead and impossible to save or you don't have the time to build stuff up. It's not that it deviates from the lore, it's *when* it deviates from the lore that I'd like to have more control over. It would be a submod or something rather than integrated into the main thing. 

Still, I suppose you're right, and all the ridiculous things like Varys becoming LP of the Stormlands or Robb marrying his aunt is part of the charm. ","I'd probably prefer to just learn to make a submod in that case, it would probably be less effort.",Well you can manually move to start at specific dates so if you know in the history files when certain events take place that you want to happen just make sure you start after them,"Oh, you can too.

If it is true Jon will still be alive (or be resurrected) as he's too important for the story to kill off before the final chapter/episode. Same with Dany. By the end of the series and novels they will probably be some of the only original characters left.

I honestly can't see anyway else than the title can be interpreted.,"Imo in the show Loras Tyrell is in kill able, because he was called the heir to Highgarden, which he isn't. In the show him dying then would be incredibly important, whereas in the books it would be minor. The show wouldn't want to add complications that the book doesn't feature, if the show runners won't add Garlan and Willas, they surely wouldn't go through the trouble of Loras' death.",The others vs the dragons? Winter vs summer?,"Too vague. The entire series is character driven rather than world building. It wouldn't make sense to name the series after a mob of ice zombies and 3 characterless dragons.

Plus why build Jon so much to have him die in such a unimpressive manner? If he had died fighting the ice king in single combat epically then I would believe him dead but this was just too wtf.

Every other major death does something. Eddard Stark death led to Robb declaring war. Robbs death led to Boltons rising in power. Tywin led to Tyrion in Essos and to cersei fucking up.

Everyone can die but those deaths move things along. Jon's does nothing for anyone.","I don't think he's dead but he is still far from unkillable. Jons death could lead to the fall of the wall to the others, and the others sweeping south. I could easily see the books taking a turn towards that. Dany pulls a stannis on a much larger scale and rescues Westeros with her dragons.","If the wall falls then the North is next. I don't see The Bolton rule in the North being ended by White Walkers instead of Starks. Jon is essential to the story imo.

Anyways we'll just have to wait until the last book so there's really no point moving forward with this.","I don't think that's likely, just like I don't think Jon died like I said. I'm just saying grrm could easily take that turn if he wanted Jon dead permanently.",You could try and fabricate a claim on it by using your Chancellor type character on your small council.

I also don't post them on Paradox because I don't agree with their censorship rules for mods that bans posting on forums outside of Paradox and Steam, rules that forbid me from hosting my mods on sites like ModDb and Nexus mods.

If AGOT Team obeyed those rules(Apparently not understanding exemption does not mean they aren't violating the rule, just that they aren't punished for it) you wouldn't have this forum to question my choices when it comes to posting about my mods. If I obeyed them, or the AGOT team enforced them on Paradox's behalf, then you wouldn't know about my mods to begin with.

I was the Lord of Cornfield (duke tier) and at some point I got a claim on Fang Tower (the ones the Cleganes hold in the later starter dates), pressed it and once I conquered it, I gave it to my heir even if I usually don't do that, as I expected I would die quickly.

My character refused to die, however, and after he legitimized a bastard girl and acknowledged a bastard son, his wife started hating him, leaving Ser Tywin as the only trueborn son he had.. until a few years later when they suddenly started having children again, including two sons (Kevan & Steffon). My planned heir, Ser Tywin, ended up dying quickly thereafter, and his young son became one of my vassals... meaning I couldn't educate him and he became shit, so I changed the law to Ultimogeniture as my last ""trueborn"" son, Steffon, proved quite good.

Many years later, Lord Steffon ""the Old"" simply refused to die, so I used to the console command to check his health (9.5).. and noticed he was a secret bastard, whose real father was Ser Tywin of Fang Tower. I was confused. Isn't that supposed to be Steffon's brother ? Yes.. yes he is. Oh, and they share the same mother. In the end, Lord Loren only had two sons of his own, a bastard named Tygett and Ser Tywin. Every single one of his other children were fathered by his firstborn son on his own mother.

Also, why am I only allowed to turn maybe 25% of my POWs into thralls?

But this tooltip doesn't specify, and just says that POWs can be taken as slaves. Also, the decisions in the Intrigue list have my conditions wrong; for instance, in my original linked image, Donal Nate *is* a POW, but the tooltip says he isn't.

I'm starting to think this might be a bug, but I would love to hear if someone knows that I'm just doing something wrong.","An event fires when the Ironborn raid a province, it gives them the option to ake some slaves or not, those are the POWs it speaks of.
For the decision you have to currently be at war with the prisoenr's liege or top liege. eg: I Balon Greyjoy am attacking Tywin Lannister, I take Cersei Lannister prisoner, I can make her a slave by the decision whilst I am still at war with Tywin Lannister. Once the war ends I can no longer take her as a slave even if she is still my prisoner as I am no longer at war with Tywin Lannister.","Well, the scenario you described didn't play out like you described, but I unfortunately didn't take any screenshots.

They were just POWs. I could drown them, but that's it.

It could be that the decision to take thralls only pops up during coastal raids, but I have only done that a handful of times. I've taken two salt wives that way, but no slaves yet.",The raid event only happens during a raid obviously.,"Right, I get that. I assumed when you said this:

Once the war ends I can no longer take her as a slave even if she is still my prisoner as I am no longer at war with Tywin Lannister.

... you were describing an actual declared war. The decisions in the Intrigue menu are not related to raids, right?",There is a decision to take someone as a slave but I believe you must have legal slavery to do that. The Ironborn get a decision to take prisoners as Salt Wives regardless of their laws,Ok its gone (I have still no idea what was the problem),"It is very common in my games that every claim war or mega war some of the dukes revert to me (iron throne).  I believe there are several reasons for this.  
The claim war seem to change the vassal contract if the person starting the war wins (i.e. a duke in the reach successfully grabs another duke title away from the lord paramount of the reach then part of the peace agreement is the double duke is now a vassal of the iron throne.  This pisses off the lord paramount since it is their de joir vassal)  When this happens I just send them back to the lord that they came from.  I don't know if this upsets the lesser lord but it certainly makes my lord paramounts happy which for me is the bigger win.  
During mega wars if the lord paramount doesn't join my war and the lesser lord does then at the conclusion they become my vassal (sometimes, this might be effected by the order of joining the war if the lord paramount joins after the lesser lord).  
Also if you have absolute crown authority I think that take an additional 10 slots away (when compared to medium).  It makes expanding outside Westeros hard on anything higher than medium authority.  Basically every time I or my vassals fight I go back through the list after the war of who belongs to who to keep it under the limit.

When she saw the Usurper's rebel host across the river **they were armored all in ice**, but **she bathed them in dragonfire** and **they melted away like dew** and turned the Trident into a torrent. Some small part of her knew that she was dreaming, but another part exulted. This is how it was meant to be. The other was a nightmare, and I have only now awakened.

Their final DLC is going to be the one that doesn't make enough money to meet the standard that PDX considers enough, I don't think Holy Fury will disappoint in that regard so they should be set to make another DLC I think. But what's important to consider is what will follow Holy Fury? I am sure PDX would love to keep making DLC but there isn't much left in terms of large features that would really draw in some hype. 

The last big thing I can think of is maybe a large rework of cultures. Cultures are almost entirely pointless in the game and basically only serve 3 somewhat insignificant purposes, to determine the names of things, what your retinue is (not so insignificant I suppose) and to decide if your ruler is a foreigner or not. Excluding retinue, off the top of my head I cannot think of any culture in the game besides the Mongol's Genghis Khan decision that allows you to do something that is not available to any other culture through any other means, essentially completely unique. Norse (and the other Scandinavian cultures) can erect rune stones but this is also available to all followers of the Germanic religion so not unique to the culture.","Though by the dd's it seems that they are changing/tweaking/fixing and adding so much stuff that it feels like they want the game to be in it's complete form so they can move on to another project. And considering Imperator is just around the corner plus the clamor for Vic3 it is very plausible that this will be the last.

What I feel disqualifies it is rather that it is *thematically* divergent from ASoIaF. That's the main thing, but on top of that the way it treats its characters is a classic characteristic of bad fan fiction - author favoritism manifesting in the form of 'fixing' unpalatable aspects of canonical characters they like (e.g. the erasure of Tyrion's darker side, the toning down of Tywin, Cersei, Sandor and more, etc.) whilst marginalizing or else exaggerating the character flaws of the ones they don't (oh hi there Stannis), over-infatuation with bland OCs, etc.",No need to be a twat.,"The Godfather books and the movies aren't identical.

Best ways are to start a faction (if the ruler is really awful it shouldn't be too hard to garner support) or join a rebellion against the tyranny of the liege. If you win the rebellion the Iron Throne authority gets lowered. I got lucky with mine since the Iron Throne was being inherited by awful rulers and constantly getting into wars, it was the Cracklaw lords who started a rebellion and they won because the Iron Throne was busy dealing with other wars. The Reach, the North and Dorne refused to help, The Trident and the Westerlands were already independent, the Vale helped but was busy with internal conflicts, I refused to help the Iron Throne, so in the Cracklaw lords actually won the rebellion (and they became independent, but I don't plan on vassalising them yet, I'm focusing on getting the counties around King's Landing). Just avoid King's Landing (both county and duchy) since the Iron Throne ruler always gets intrigue decision to demand it.","It's not dead, it's fun. All the major houses in the game have a huge fortress and if you let the AI do it's thing its like nothing changes. In my game alone, just because I gave House Rosby a huge fortress, I've practically altered the political landscape of Westeros without any other cheats. The Westerlands, The North, Dorne and the Trident have all gone independent. The Iron Born Islands turned into an Essossi Valyrian Triarchy. The Westerlands ended up being ruled by a pirate Lannister. The North is ruled by a Wildling woman, who also rules the Stormlands and the Wall. House Yronwood became the ruling house of Dorne. House Velaryon has three dragon riders alone. House Baratheon became extinct.

No player character would ever be able to join the Kingsguard and the Small Council is literally just the council of the Iron Throne.

There are already decisions to show those characters and the Kingsguard already get their special armour.

If you are going to suggest something be a society you need to think through more than just ""this is a group of people"", in game terms you need content for different ranks, missions, events, powers, interactions with over events and system.

The society also has to be more than like 5 people or a bunch of people who are all unlanded and hence not playable characters.","People who sacrifice to the white walkers among the wildlings

","I could see most of the religions outside of westeros ending up having societies and powers associated to their ranks. 
the warlocks of Qarth 
Red priests of rhllor 
Shadowbinders of  asshai 
Possibly even valyrian wizards (although I don't think there would be any examples in the timeline the game has, but it'd be cool to restore them maybe in the colonise valyria submod or something) 

All these groups have very real powers at least once dragons were awakened and members where set apart from the everyday followers of the faith.

","Everyone seems to tell you about how the faith militant or sparrows could be a good option, but how about the order of green men for old Gods followers.

There is also orders of chivalry that could be good like the order of the green hand in the reach or the brotherhood of winged knights in the vale. If possible you could even add an event to create a knightly order if you have a certain number of cash or prestige and a kingdom title, but I don't know if that's possible. I think valyrian wizards would be cool to add for the valyrian faithful of volantis. What do you think?",The only group that really comes to mind is the faith militant.,Would the Brotherhood without Banners and maybe the Sons of the Harpy work as societies then? Maybe a way to add more depth to certain merc companies. Might be completely wrong cause I haven't read everything about M&M.,"I agree that for the Kingsguard it would not give much experience for the player, but it would perhaps make them easier to organise (both for the king and the devs). This, I think, would also make it easier to create other societies like it for other realms.

","This actually really good, ""The Winter Cult""",Afaik all of these are unplayable which makes creating societies rather pointless.,"But there is absolutely no basis for an order of northerners trying to spread the old gods south or for some group of valyrian wizards.

For the knightly orders, what missions would you have them do though? It would be a very dull society.

Sons of Harpy, whilst they could work there is no point going through and adding all the content for them when they can just be represented through plots, factions and the flavour text in Dany's event chain.

Merc companies...? In what way would that work? 

Just in case you are unclear as you said yourself you have not looked at MnM much, the way a society works is that they are not dynamic. They exist from the game start (they can be hidden and have no members but they always technically exist in game engine terms) and they must have ranks, events and missions all scripted.","Not at all, making societies is far more of a pain as you need all the things I mentioned above.

When Catelyn was trying to get Walder Frey to open his gates to Robb, she appeals to him by reminding him of his past allegiance to House Tully. 

Cersei intentionally distances herself from the Baratheons. If she had maintained the alliance between the Lannisters and Baratheons following Robert's death, it might be different. ","In my mind I thought it was bound by law that when a woman marries a man, she basically becomes a part of the man's house. This is why Catelyn became a Stark after she married Eddard, and why Lysa is called Lysa Arryn and not Lysa Tully.

But I googled it a bit and it seems its different for royalty. A woman cannot become royalty by marrying into the King's house, apparently.","Yeah, as far as the show is concerned, it just seems to be whatever is most beneficial to the two families at the time. 

In the first season of GOT, for example, Robert Baratheon proposed joining the Baratheon and Stark name (he explicitly says ""Let's join our houses""). It's hard to say since it never happened, but it seems like he want to unite the two families into one political entity (fun fact, this is why Sansa was originally betrothed to Joffrey). 

That would have been entirely different from Cercei's marriage to Robert, which was strictly for maintaining an alliance, as before that the houses had been at war with one another.

Until then they are very much killable and I only use them when I am outnumbered severely.,"Right, but it doesn't make sense to have it as part of the surrender conditions for Aegon unless the war is actually about proving Aegon's illegitimacy.

If it's just Dany asserting her right to the throne by conquest, Aegon's standing as a Targaryen is irrelevant so it shouldn't be introduced as a surrender condition for the war.

If the devs were going to do something that recognised Aegon is definitely not a Targaryen (something that is as of ADwD just a fan theory) then it should be a decision that Dany can take once she has the Iron Throne, not automatically enforced by taking the throne.

Just like Dany can take Joffrey's throne without disproving he is a Baratheon.","Possibly, but even if he were, usurping his throne wouldn't prove or disprove anything about his ancestry.",">Isn't Griff a Blackfyre

Nope that's only fan speculation. Or did you mean in game? No.","How does Dany winning the throne mean that Young Griff gets delegitimised? Why would he stop being a Targaryen at that moment? Why would he stop having claims?

It doesn't make sense that winning a war would have those effects unless the war were specifically about him not being a Targaryen and having no claim whatsoever.

If it's just a simple 'the iron throne is mine' style war, it makes no sense for peace terms to include that.
","Usually once I get unyielding it's pretty impossible to lose. Also I think dragons can only get into combat when you deploy them, but even without you still get the combat bonus from having a dragon without the risk. ",I think we're on the same page here. I imagined it being an optional event or decision if Dany defeats Griff for the throne.,"It's not about his actual ancestry, its more making sure he can't attempt to usurp the throne.","TL;DR He has a very shady origin which means any claim made by Dany will most likely be made on the basis of him not really being Aegon Targaryen. And if the claim is made on this basis he will legally quit being a Targaryen the moment Dany fries his ass or imprisons him.

Except it is not a simple ""the Iron Throne is mine"" style war, or rather it won't be when it happens canonically. It will be a ""I don't believe you are really my nephew so GTFO my throne or burn"" type of war.  
Because, legally speaking, Dany has no claim if Aegon is really Aegon. Her claim relies on his being dead. So logically speaking, if Dany wins, she will claim Aegon and all of his children are not really Targaryens, but pretenders. A canon example of this sort of thing is Gaemon Pailhair, who was a pretender claimant to the Iron Throne after the Dance who's mother claimed him to be a bastard of Aegon II, who was a known womanizer. After Gaemon was defeated and the Red Keep retaken (he briefly took it), his mother was tortured to death until she ""confessed"" that he was really the son of a Lyseni merchant.

Or an even better example would be Daemon Blackfyre, who rested his entire claim on the idea that Daeron II was a secret bastard of Aemon the Dragonknight and Queen Consort Naerys. If Daemon had won, Daeron would have legally become the bastard son of Aemon the Dragonknight regardless of real parentage.

Generally speaking, the winning claimant will do everything within their power to delegitimize their rivals, and the shady origin of Young Griff brings his legitimacy into question and gives Dany room to delegitimize him. I am not saying we should add ""bastard"" to him, just set his dynasty back to ""of Essos"" in the proposed event to reflect this.","Still, I almost never beat armies larger than me without either having a massive terrain + crossing bonus even with unyielding. The stupid event chain forces me to liberate all of Essos so my Unsullied are usually all dead by the time I get to Westeros.","Agreed.

The way OP phrased it in later comments however was that Young Griff somehow loses his right to call himself a Targaryen by virtue of losing the throne. Regardless of whether or not Dany suspects him to not be a Targaryen.","But he's a pretender to the throne...

He doesn't stop being a Targaryen because his aunt usurped his throne.",">he will legally quit being a Targaryen the moment Dany fries his ass or imprisons him.

Not without disproving his claim of being Aegon Targaryen, which winning a war doesn't do.",Like I said with unyielding and your dragons you can win nearly any fight if you just let them come to you. The bonuses from both of those and natural defensive bonus makes for pretty safe warring. I only find my self losing troops to attrition or during siege on my Dany playthoughs.,"He can stop being a legal Targaryen. For example, if Daemon Blackfyre won his rebellion, then Daeron and all his descendants would become the bastard line of Aemon the Dragonknight, legally speaking, and would lose the right to bear the Targaryen name. Aegon, if he loses, will be denounced as a pretender. The only way Dany can legally, cleanly, and efficiently label him a pretender is by declaring that he is not a Targaryen (probably making up some story about how he is a Lyseni bastard like what happened to Gaemon Palehair in canon).","But it will. If he and his children are imprisoned by Daenerys then she is in a position to dictate any terms she likes. She doesn't have to prove her suspicions about Aegon's ancestry because she has three dragons and ten thousand unsullied and whatever other forces she takes the throne with. Since the monarch is the law in Westeros, this decree will be officially accepted unless Dany later loses the throne to Aegon or his allies.",Really? I very consistently lose 10k stacks led by my dragons (I usually let Jorah and Barristan tame them so that I can have 3 dragon riders immediately and those two usually die within 5-10 years freeing the dragons up) to combined 50k Lannister/Tyrell stacks. But then again it might just be that after beating the anti-Me coalition I use the console to instantly win my forced liberation wars in Essos so I can go ahead and attack Westeros so my dragons don't have 10-20 years of war to mature.,"If Daemon Blackfyre won he would either legitimise himself as a Targaryen or he would make Blackfyre the ruling dynasty and leave the Targaryens as a cadet branch. Kind of like the Karstarks are to the Starks.

It doesn't make sense that a war for the throne also decides whether that family should even be called a Targaryen in the first place. That's a whole separate issue ","I understand that you think there should be a situation where that can happen.

I'm saying it doesn't make sense to have that tied to winning the war.

It needs to be a separate decision.","Not when the origin of the founder is in question. In Westeros family name matters, and being able to LEGALLY hold the name matters. If Daemon won, he would either keep the Blackfyre name or take the Targaryen name, but regardless of this, his entire claim was made on the basis of Daeron being a bastard of Aemon and thereby not legally allowed to sit the throne. If he had won, he would have definitely made history remember Daeron II as ""Daeron Waters"" and Daeron's heirs would not legally be Targaryens. They would all be ""Waters"". Legally speaking. In the game, post Blackfyre victory, Daemon and every Blackfyre king thereafter literally has this option as a decision which they almost universally take.

Dany would not claim the throne if she believed Young Griff was her nephew. She looks up to Rhaegar (or rather everyone around her has been feeding her tales of him being a hero, so this is reasonable to assume). Because she has no claim if her nephew is alive. Therefore, there are two solutions if she wins:

1.) Just kill him and his heirs and be damned by the Realm as a kinslayer (her dragons are nowhere near large enough to make her invincible yet)

2.) Point out the fact that he has a really shady background, and that his cover story only works in hindsight, and legally make him not a Targaryen. Which people would accept because any Dance of the Dragons will be very bloody and will make the realm even more tired of war and consequently willing to accept more outrageous claims to end the fighting.

I am not suggesting we take Aegon's claim away, just remove him and his heirs from the Targaryen dynasty. I am not sure how it doesn't make sense... You seem to be assuming she will accept him as her nephew and still try to take the throne, I am saying that Dany would not raise arms against a son of Rhaegar is she believed him to be real, and would therefore legally make him not a Targaryen.","It sounds like you're asking for a similar sort of event that Stannis has in regards to Cersei's bastards. If so, that's fine. You could probably almost do that through plots to investigate legitimacy anyway.

But to just have it as an automatic result of Dany beating Aegon in a war for the throne doesn't make sense. Unless you establish that Dany has some reason to suspect Aegon's legitimacy first of course, and even then it would be a decision of whether to expose him as a fake or not.","Something like that. Though I think the AI should automatically lean heavily towards taking the decision to denounce Aegon, I think it should be left up to the human playing Dany to make the final decision.  I think the decision would most logically have to be made before Dany crossed the Narrow Sea, however, likely when she first learns of Aegon, as she has no claim if Aegon is acknowledged as real.","Who is the Disinherited, excommunicated, kinslaying, scarred, former slave, dragon riding Lannister?",Probably Tyrion.,"Murderplot in 3...2...1...

At no point does  Jon break any of his vows by saving the Wildlings. In fact he is fulfilling his vow of protecting the realms of men by saving the Wildlings from the White Walkers.

The rest are a result of more than just inbreeding, which only really has such effects in the immediate short term in animals. After a while, most abnormal effects get bred out. Stillbirths happen because of magic dragon blood, in Daemon's case, bad luck in Viserys case, and being fucking bonkers in Aerys case. Being an abusive SoB who rapes his wife constantly can be bad for the health of the unborn. Inbreeding really has nothing to do with this, and Westeros has first cousin marriages anyway. ","In the pre-Holy Fury version of the mod, I did a 200-year Targaryen campaign. Everything is pretty much normal except the dragon portraits, but I'm not continuing it anytime soon. I went back on it to count the stillbirths. There were 10 monarchs across 11 generations, plus the sitting Prince of Dragonstone. These characters had 2 stillbirths and 1 other death before the age of 15 (when the portraits change to adult portraits), 70 living and/or dead adults and 8 living children. This doesn't include unacknowledged bastards, as I never acknowledge stillborn bastards. They aren't prone to stillbirths.","1.) Most of the most prominent examples are ""immediate"" (within a generation of heavy inbreeding).

2.) How do we know that Maegor's spawn were getting murdered?

3.) Is there any real proof that ""magic dragon blood"" causes stillbirths and not the more likely culprit -- several generations of inbreeding? I do recall a real-world family suffering from just these types of problems that no longer exists -- the Spanish branch of the Habsburg line.

4.) As for Aerys raping his wife, I don't believe he raped his wife during the actual pregnancies, because he was so paranoid about making heirs that he probably wouldn't risk it. 

The rapes *caused* the pregnancies, but the female body can't differentiate between a rape-origin fetus and a consensual fetus, so I fail to see how Aerys raping Rhaella has anything to do with the stillbirths.

I'd also like to point out, the stillbirths played a large role in Aerys losing his mind and becoming a sadistic lunatic who raped his wife. Early in their relationship, their status was amiable and there likely was no rape. Only after several stillbirths did Aerys grow cold to Rhaella.","Okay, interesting. I think they should be much more common (if only to account for canon in general having a high rate of stillbirths), but I digress. Thanks for checking.","> 1.) Most of the most prominent examples are ""immediate"" (within a generation of heavy inbreeding).

These aren't really prominent examples. Just the ones you picked out, tbh.

>2.) How do we know that Maegor's spawn were getting murdered?

She admitted it and even predicted a future death. You can say that was fabricated, and you did before I replied, but none of your retorts apply to Maegor regardless. 

>3.) Is there any real proof that ""magic dragon blood"" causes stillbirths and not the more likely culprit -- several generations of inbreeding? I do recall a real-world family suffering from just these types of problems that no longer exists -- the Spanish branch of the Habsburg line.

The dragon scales and wings kind of give it away. The Targaryens don't have a history of stillbirths regardless, despite you trying to establish one. 

>4.) As for Aerys raping his wife, I don't believe he raped his wife during the actual pregnancies, because he was so paranoid about making heirs that he probably wouldn't risk it.

Aerys constantly abused his wife and she was sickly and depressed their entire marriage. 

>The rapes caused the pregnancies, but the female body can't differentiate between a rape-origin fetus and a consensual fetus, so I fail to see how Aerys raping Rhaella has anything to do with the stillbirths.

Because Rhaella is a person and not a robot? Her psychological state matters a lot when determining the health of her child. This is basic stuff, tbh. That nonsense that Holy Fury adds isn't nonsense. 

>I'd also like to point out, the stillbirths played a large role in Aerys losing his mind and becoming a sadistic lunatic who raped his wife. Early in their relationship, their status was amiable and there likely was no rape. Only after several stillbirths did Aerys grow cold to Rhaella.

No? It has a lot more to do with Duskendale and his cousin dying. He never wanted to be with Rhaella and was never fond of her. ","> 2.) How do we know that Maegor's spawn were getting murdered?

Tyanna of the Tower was 100% murdering the children in the womb ","1.) Well, the fact of the matter is, only 2 Targaryen stillbirths are recorded for un-inbred members of the family, while countless stillbirths are recorded for the inbreeding members of the family.

2.) Under torture. Anything anybody says while being tortured can only be taken with a grain of salt. And, could you please provide an excerpt of the text where she predicts a future death? Not doubting you, just curious.

3.) Perhaps blood is the culprit. In that case, the Targaryens should still have a higher rate of stillbirths than they do in-game. And actually, the Targaryens do have quite a history of stillbirths and weak dynasts. A simple read of the world book should show this.

4.) Do you have any proof that he abused her from the very beginning? All evidence points towards the contrary. He only started abusing her when his paranoia over the stillbirths/dying children led him to delusionally believe that she was cheating on him.

The World of Ice and Fire: ""At first, His Grace comforted Rhaella in her grief, but over time his compassion turned to suspicion. By 270 AC he had decided that the queen was being unfaithful to him.""

Whether or not they both desired the marriage is irrelevant, Aerys started out at least somewhat decent but degraded in his mental state over time.","Do you perhaps have some sort of citation/excerpt from the text (I don't own Fire and Blood or SotD)?

From what I've read in the worldbook, it seems like it might quite be a falsehood. After all, she only confessed under torture, and Westerosi dislike foreigners with foreign gods, especially if said foreigners dabble in the occult.",There are none inbreeding parts of the family? Cause I thought Aegon's wifes were his sisters,"I own the F&B audiobook so I can't just look up the passage but I've read it twice and she didn't just confess, she bragged that the other wives would lose their babies.  

No false confessions here, it was her.","I don’t have the book on hand but here is an excerpt from the asoiaf wiki which seems to have updated everything since Fire and Blood;

In 48 AC Tyanna was seized and taken to the dungeons by two of Maegor's Kingsguard, Ser Owen Bush and Ser Maladon Moore. As the torturers prepared their tools, she confessed her responsibility for the two abominations that were born of Maegor's seed, claiming that she had poisoned the babies in their mothers womb, being queen's Alys Harroway and Jeyne Westerling respectively, and promised that the same fate would befall, Elinor Costayne, one of Maegor's Black Brides, who was with child.[3] She was killed by Maegor's own hand, her heart cut out with the Valyrian steel sword Blackfyre and thrown to his dogs.[2]

Tyanna's promise did indeed come to pass as two moons later Queen Elinor birthed a stillborn monstrosity as well.[3]","The most popular way to track ""level of inbreeding"" IRL is with the ""inbreeding coefficient.""

Simply, the coefficient increases when you marry close relatives, and decreases when you marry out of the family. A real-world example of the usage was in determining that the last Habsburg king of Spain was more inbred than if he had been born to siblings.

Daeron II was the last Targaryen born of incest (unless you count Aerion's kid, Maegor, who was born to cousins) until the birth of Mad Aerys. That is, there were 3 generations of kings who married out of the family (Daeron II, Maekar I, and Aegon V). In addition to this, Daeron II's grandfather, Viserys II, was married to a Rogare of completely different descent, so Daeron's inbreeding coefficient would have been lower than, say, Viserys I, or Aegon III/Viserys II, who were all descendants of multiple generations of sibling/uncle/niece incest.

I am pointing out that characters with a higher inbreeding coefficient are more likely to have stillborns and weak/deformed kids.

It's interesting to note that no Targaryens born of the line of Daeron II (with the exception of Prince Valarr) before Mad Aerys' brood had stillborns.","Okay, thanks for the clarification!",Thanks!,Couldn't you   be a   little more specific?,I had people mouths hair and eyes be across the screen from their faces,You had Holy Fury active.,Ya I know,"You need to disable it on 3.01 or 3.011, and then rollback to the last pre-3.00 version.

Then again, you never really know what to expect with this game so you shouldn't necessarily go into a scenario thinking it'll be super hard or easy.",you are picking some of the easiest characters to play.

The AI almost immediately took it back and restored the Night's Watch.

Honestly, I'd love for the White Walkers to get a difficulty boost. How long does the average game last? 100 or so years? Power them up, and have them spawn 100 years into the playthough. Have them be this huge, difficult end-game event that you have to prepare for.

If I could, I'd make a WW submod to do this - have them spawn a century or so in, with a much larger army. Maybe even write some events where if your Kingdom in Westeros has fallen, you can evacuate your family across the narrow sea and try to rally support there to take back your homeland. 

Unfortunately, I have no clue where to start, and I feel like it would be an immensely complicated thing to do.","On one of my Greyjoy playthroughs, they took over Essos and Westeros. 200 years of darkness ensued, and in the end, I, a black-skinned Greyjoy from the Summer Isles, vanquished the Walkers from the world.

Westeros was filled with black-skinned lords (most Houses died out, and the ones that survived married with the Summer Islanders) and Essos returned into republics but this time run by descendants of slaves (literally all of the nobility died, not a single slaver or his family was alive).

No screenshots, because this was before I knew how.","Took out Westeros, nothing happened in Essos, while palying as Pirate King.  No screenies sadly, as this save ended with me raging over having my only heir castrated.",They took over pretty much all of Westeros and were doing damage in Essos.  I beat the Westeros ones when they had all but 3 or 4 territories on the mainland.  That was one of my favorite playthroughs ever.,"for me, theyre always just standing there in thenns area doing nothing with like 2k soldiers... are they meant to move against me? or are the nightswatch taking care of it without help? i've yet to ever have to bother myself with them",Took the whole of westeros ;) http://imgur.com/a/yZffi,How'd they get to Essos?,They took the North. And didn't stop raiding until I finally pushed them back.,The most I've seen them do in my games is take the most northern part of the North before they were defeated,"I kinda like the way they are now. As it stands the White Walkers are absolutely no threat to a peaceful realm united together which makes absolute sense. The Night's Watch has so much trouble with them in the story because they're undermanned and the Realm is in chaos and rulers like Tywin Lannister would rather play politics with the Wall rather than help out.

Most stories I hear about the White Walkers taking over seem to have a very similar beginning. The Realm was suffering a civil war and the Walkers faced no resistance against the Night's Watch. If they take the Night's Watch you basically have one last chance to stop them before they become too powerful to stop.

It's very similar to how the Wildlings take over, the realm is too distracted to help the North and the Night's Watch fight them off.

The difficulty for the WW is fine I think.",I can't imagine it would be that hard. Increase troop numbers and add an event that gives you claims somewhere across the narrow sea. ,"Yes I'd love it if someone could do this. 

Even if the kingdom is united I don't see everyone jumping in for help. Make it so I the North can help if they choose. No other region. Once the walkers take over the wall give them a new boost so they are a huge threat. Such a threat they'd be very difficult to beat back, maybe even make it nearly impossible unless you had dragons. 

I like the evacuation idea. If it comes to that you usurp a little title somewhere. Essos or summer islands, maybe it can give you a event where you can choose where. Have some surging houses in your court too. It would be like Noah's Arc.","They can spawn at the Five Forts and attack Yi Ti, but in 1.2 they start with -100% warscore every time.",I understand what you're saying about a united realm but I still think there needs to be a difficulty boost because no way in real life would some Dornish lord march his armies north because some murderer serving in the Nights Watch is claiming that the Undead are preparing to head south and kill everyone.,"That's odd, what's the point of them spawning there if they automatically lose?","You'll need to sow dissent to get vassals to hate Robb, then when a rebellion against him succeeds crown authority will be lowered so you can fight wars freely.","I'm AFK at the moment, I'm assuming that's the spymaster?

Should I sow dissent at Kings Landing now, or would he still be better placed in Winterfell?","It's your chancellor, send him to Winterfell to sow dissent. May take a few years, alternatively, start the faction yourself to lower crown authority, vassals are usually pretty eager to join. 

Use any heirs to try to make alliances, they will fight with you even if they're not in the faction. 

Also, if any other High Lords owe you a favour, you can instantly make them join your faction.

Fire the faction, win the war, once crown authority is low, go ahead and use your claims. 

Karhold is pretty weak, would start there. 

Good luck. ","Has Robb won his war of independence? If he has, he should have an empire tier title and you should sow dissent in Winterfell. If not then sow dissent in KL.","Is there a way to get claims on high lordships? I've been wondering a while since taking over county by county seems, lengthy and could cause problems vassal/demense wise","Yeah, sometimes when fabricating a claim you'll get a claim on the entire high lordship that Provence is in, then when you press that claim, you'll be the new high Lord, the downside with this is it usually leaves the previous high Lord as just a Lord and you're vassal, and they're usually really pissed off at you, so if you get a high lordship claim, also wait until you can get the lordship claim, so in one ear you can get both, for example, the high lordship of Karhold, and the Provence of Karhold.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0gb84Y1yoQ&index=2&list=PLvQFRapmLLCM38wVtCvYMcbhs8dIQ0Uhs","If you want an easy start in the AGOT mod, I recommend playing as Robb Stark in the Clash of Kings scenario. You start with a doomstack of 30000 or so men in the Riverlands. Make them head straight for King's Landing and siege it. Ignore the Ironborn for the time being. You should capture Joffrey and get a 100 percent war score. Kill Joffrey and Cersei but spare the rest of the Lannisters. Try and get Tyrion to join your court, he has 20+ stats in everything but Martial IIRC and he'll be glad Cersei's dead. Your small council as an independent North sucks and the only good members are Greatjon as Marshall and Roose as Spymaster. Tyrion will make you rich as your steward. Myrcella is the perfect wife for Robb (Attractive and Genius, 100 base fertility, strong claim for the IT to press.), and Tommen makes a great puppet if you educate him with a loyal bannerman like Greatjon Umber or Wyman Manderly. 

Once you are done with the Lannisters, disband all your armies and raise them again to focus on the Greyjoys. Your doomstack should appear at Winterfell. You will have a -60 to -80 warscore, but that is normal. They won't make it any farther due to attrition. Take the doomstack and clean out all the provinces they occupied and hunt down their shrinking armies. They don't stand a chance. Execute any Ironborn generals you capture immediately. They are broke, they all hate you, they all have high martial and are too risky to keep alive, and they won't give you valuable wards like the Lannisters. Just offer Balon white peace once the last reavers are off of your land. It isn't worth the time invading the Iron Islands because what I describe in the next paragraph is much more important.

Wait a year or so until Myrcella is old enough to marry. Marry her then press her claim. Most of the time, either Stannis or Aegon will be on the IT. Both of them have small armies, and Aegon is truly pathetic as he has no dragon and the Golden Company sometimes disbands after he takes the IT and he is left with 2000 total army levies. If it doesn't, you still have 15-20000 more men than he does. You should win either way. Your son then becomes heir to both the North and the Iron Throne. Just make sure both empires have primogeniture as the succession laws.",pick seduction focus and seduce lyanna,"I'd recommend trying the tutorial in the vanilla game, just to get to know the mechanics and stuff.

Shortly after becoming Lord Paramount of the Storm Lands, Hizdahr zo Loraq was killed and I was able to marry Daenerys so that I could keep the blood of the Dragon pure.

Despite losing the Storm Lands, Stannis was able to defeat the Boltons and declared war on the Iron Throne, who were already involved in a bunch of civil wars in the Crownlands and Westerlands.

Now with the power of the Storm Lands, Dorne, Pentos, Meereen and the Golden Company I was able to smash Tommen and the Lannisters and declared myself Aegon VI of the Iron Throne. Shortly afterwards Dany gave me Rhaegal and I became known as Aegon The Dragontamer whilst wielding Blackfyre.","Marry Dany and you usually get one of her dragons. Even if you don't, you still have a dragon rider commander you can use in battles.","I played Aegon once, and Tommen defeated Stannis and then abdicated to me- literally the easiest game ever ","I just wanted to mention that in the WOTFK start date, I've seen the 'Aegon Lands' event spawning him with not just his own 10k troops but another 10k allied Golden Company troops, usually if he lands on Crackclaw Point. Its probably far easier switching to him TBH. ","I did it, it was pretty easy. I basically got married to Illyrio Mopatis' daughter, got his army to join me + the Golden Company helping me out and I conquered King's Landing.

The hard part was dealing with Tommen's wars after I conquered the throne and killed him like independence and peasant revolts. Also Cersei over at Casterly Rock declared war on me too so that was also great. 

I haven't played in about two weeks.",Cheat. Use the Cash cheat to hire merc ships and siege Dragonstone. Boom you win. Then it's time to assault Kings Landing (wait until The Martells are close by). Usually a lot of the North will join you since they hate the Lannisters. Dany usually won't marry you until you've taken the Throne.,"A lot of the time Tommen is being educated by some random courtier who is out leading an army, which makes him nearly impossible to capture.",I haven't been able to marry her till I take the Iron Throne,Yeah because you are of a different dynasty until you win.,There was an CK2 update that isn't compatible with the mod.

It may be that some submods you are using are incompatible with each other.  Wat submods are you using?,"It's buggy for me as well. In my ""Beneath the Black Flag"" AAR, off screen, after a megawar happened, my conquered lands would sometimes revert to the Iron Throne! I had to use console commands to correct this.","Probably conflicting mods or the like. I think turning off More Decisions might solve it, that one in particular usually conflicts for me and is the source of many bugs/crashes (as much as I love it).","It happens when Euron takes the Seastone Chair. Also, it randomly made them all vassal of the Yi Ti empire once. I've reloaded and things like this have happened multiple times under different circumstances. The constant is that the Iron Throne only ever keeps domain of the West and all the nearby lands become independent.",Nope. I made sure to check,"Similar thing happened to me in ""Beneath the Black Flag,"" and I don't use any submods. After a megawar, I would notice the Reach and Westerlands reverting to the Iron Throne. I corrected it with console commands.","If you use submods, then one of them is not the right version for the main mod.

Guardian gets three options, which are (according to memory)

- do nothing: 95% kid gets brave, 5% kid dies
- forbid it: kid gets wroth or deceitful (I think?)
- ""teach him a lesson"": you push the kid out of the window, Jaime-style. Kid gets a good chance of maiming/dieing","He is playing as a kid, so actually his guardian might choose the ""teach him a lesson"" option, which is pretty likely to cause grievous harm","I was raising one of my rival's kids once and I ""taught him a lesson."" Maiming my rival's kid has never felt so good.","Ahhh yeah I didn't notice that, I always get it as a guardian and decide no harm can come of playing","Looks more like 30.

Exactly 30 titles! Well under 9000.","As someone who generally gets rid of extra titles as fast as possible to keep lords happy, this hurts to look at.",Why,"North Korea mode is cool. Before it got nerfed too damn badly I think I legitimately had a demesne of >1500. Vassals hated me, but who needed vassals? Imprison and banish, take all their lands. Keep them. BEST KOREA","Honestly, I'm surprised someone took the time to count and name the titles lol","While I did gain all of these titles legitimately, I must say I'm not really keeping them legitimately. It's hard to maintain a good army with sooo many titles. And with how many I have, it's around a -200 opinion malus to all landed nobles. I'm just waiting for all of my children to come of age before I start passing out titles like ""And you get a title, and you get a title. You get a title. ALL OF YOU GET TITLES. Which flavor would you like Aerys? Aegon? Maegon? Maerys? Aemon? Maekor? Baelor?"" ",Because why not? I'm gonna divvy them up between my children as they come of age and are married to suitable spouses.,"Yeah I can't even raise troops from vassals atm. The only nice thing is all the hostages I've been taking from them bending the knee. I'm around 22 demesne I think. Plenty to pass around 6 sons. I still want to take lannisport, even though I've nearly killed all of the Lannisters.",Ohh that makes sense. How did you manage to do that? Balerion?,You don't need to raise troops from vassals if you have no vassals. KILL THEM ALLL,"Pretty much. Declare war of conquest. Kill all their armies, then siege the base. Capture whole family including ruler. Kill all male heirs, then kill ruler, and you auto-get all of their lands. Did that to several people. And when people rose up in revolt, same thing. But I've stopped doing that, cuz now I have a -250 malus with all rulers lol. Waiting for sons to come of age, so I can pawn some of these titles off onto them. Good thing is my firstborn will have nearly all of the Crownlands for demesne. 

I have a lot of children from buying slaves, making them lovers then releasing them, making them concubines. 

EDIT: 250: 170 from owning too many duchies, and 80 from too many demesne I think.",Touche. And courtiers receive no malus for too much land and titles,"Wow, just wow. How about you kill everyone and give it off to your sons so that you are no longer in the negatives? Forgot having houses, just make everyone a Targ lol.","Pretty much the plan. But I like to ensure all of my children receive a proper education to better ensure their prosperity upon their receipt of lands to govern, which is still going to be around 7 years for all of them to be grown up. 7-10.

First, each LP (save North and Dorne) will be a Targ. Stepstones, a Targ. Volantis, a Targ. Lys (or Tyrosh) a Targ. New Valyria, a Targ. Empire of Valyria, a Targ. Andalos, a cadet (Goldfyre). Qohor, a Cadet (dunno which). Fuck it, marry a daughter to a Khal, gift their son an egg. He'll make his Dothraki a horde of dragons. Old Ghis, a Targ. Colonize Sothoryos, a Cadet. Summer Isles, a Targ. Qarth, a Targ. Asshai, a Targ. Yi-Ti, a Cadet. 

The Targaryen line will span hundreds, with distinct branches, religions, and potentially even cultures. Everyone gets a dragon. And eventually, when I get bored, what a dance it will be. I'll probably upload that save.","Wow, just wow. Why won't the North or Dorne be Targ? Are you pretty much having the whole world be Targs?","Because North is cool. And so is Dorne lol. And yeah, the whole world will be ran by Targs for the lulz.","Wow, just wow lol",http://m.memegen.com/fuw5bs.jpg ?,Did not know there was a submod for R+L=J. Love it.,EDIT:  Apparently I was wrong.

Your comment gives away more than my question...",That was my first thought too,"They mainly get legitimized in the manner that I presented, right?",Nope they get legitimized by their liege lord or higher rank. ,You can get to the other starts through custom game setup under those three you see.,"The same way you see more scenarios in vanilla, click custom game setup.

4) What would the point in it costing 10 gold be?","3) I mean balance should be better
4) never meant 10 gold, but having 4000 to upgrade town to a city is just too much","There is a simple solution to your problem, its called slavery. you can own an entire empire, and make like 20 gold a month. Tax collecting is for suckers, rampage through your enemies selling everyone into slavery for 15 to 100 or more gold per slave. that is right, not only that, if you capture a slave camp worth, you can sell each group for 400 gold, and if people don't like you for selling their relatives into slavery, then sell them too, soon you will have that 4000 gold to make kings landing stop smelling like horse crap.","Those upgrades are substantial in change (generally much better than 10-12 buildings).  While I would prefer they be spread out among that many buildings, their price isn't outside their usefulness given the prices of other buildings in the game.  ",Uprgrading castles is awesome. I've got a count in essos with more troops than any of the non reach kings of the seven kingdoms from just one county.,"> if people don't like you for selling their relatives into slavery, then sell them too

""I'm trying to play as a pirate lord during ACOK and many problems have arisen.

Firstly, many of the pirate lords are not selectable, as the county they own says that there is no character, however when you launch the game they are there.

Secondly, the pirates have no fucking fleets what-so-ever.

Thirdly, the pirates cannot raid.

Fourthly, the pirates have no invasion CB, which I read they have.

help me pls.""","Lack of religious CBs and other gameplay elements... it would be fine, if the ""will not join religious enemies against the faith"" thing wouldn't still prevent any of my southern allies from joining my war as a northerner. Fuckers.

On a semi-related note, I'd love it if R'hllor was a standalone religion. It's too powerful to also be able to marry the other eastern religions for alliances. It would be nice to have a religious CB of SOME kind as well. Maybe only if you're favoured/chosen by R'hllor, you get essentially a Holy War CB. The opinion and alliance nerfs for R'hllor becoming its own religion would more than balance the powerful CB.

Oh, and also the inability to convert the culture of provinces. I get that you don't want them changing too quickly, wouldn't be consistent with what we know, but doubling or tripling the MTTH for a county conversion would be enough.","Stannis has a pretty easy time defeating Joffrey in the Wot5K scenario. After Renly dies, the Tyrells only join Joffrey against Robb and never against Stannis. Tywin is also fighting only against Robb, so Stannis can just steamroll Joffrey's forces and easily take KL.","The AI making extremely stupid marriage decisions, especially with Littlefinger and Sansa Stark.

","Casterly rock is the equivilant of a dwarf fortress thats ready to take on colossi.

Casterly Rock IS a mountain!","In the 8000 years of history there have only been one real culture conversion, the Andal Invasion in which they brought their faith over and then assimilated with the local people. Hence no culture conversion is enabled","Yep, tywin should be at war with anyone who is fighting the iron throne because Stannis or Renly never seems to lose.  And it ultimately makes it easy for people who play Robb as well.  Once Stannis takes the iron throne very rarely does Tywin or the Tyrells join in his war of conquest against the north. ",It already has been given a buff,"What about the Dothraki destroying the Kingdom of Sarnor? The Ibbenese settlements up north? The Manderlys settling White Harbor? I'm sure there are others. 

I do know what you're saying, but it does seem like the lack of culture conversion is down more to the incredible (and frankly unrealistic) stability the known world has enjoyed over the last 8000 years. Maybe decade-long seasons don't suit protracted conquests, so people prefer to stick to their own realms, I dunno. But had Aegon been a people, instead of a person with a dragon, you can image Valyrian culture would have spread into Westeros. I dunno, it just frustrates me. I feel like slowing it would maintain the flavour and be a bit better balanced.

Still though, absolutely love your work!

It is usually followed, and it serves to at least somewhat keep the peace, mainly by getting people to agree to resist someone acting without cb, or at least not support them. Aegon throws that concept right out of the window as he just says \'I\'m taking over because I can, if you disagree try to stop me."" The Ironborn culture preaches might makes right and taking what you want by force, but even they usually restrict that to raiding. Aegon just called the system bullshit and decided he could burn any resistence. \n\nMore subtly, several examples. Daemon Blackfyre and his supporters rebelled because they thought he would be a better king, noy because he had any real right to the throne, and cooked up the argument that since Aegon IV gave him Blackfyre he was signaling a preference that he inherent the throne as cover. It was obvious that they just prefered Daemon or were looking to profit from his victory, but they had to have a legal argument, however flimsy, to provide deniability that it was just a lower grab. Robert and his supporters are mostly well aware that his cb was bs. He had a valid reason to revolt against Aerys, and even to war against Rhaegar (at least if the realm believed or accepted the rape and kidnapping accusation). But why not hand the realm to Viserys or little Aegon with a regent? The idea that the actions of Aerys and Rhaegar deligitmized their entire dynasty rather than only themselves had no basis in anything, and his reasoning for getting the Throne himself was a stretch. Hell, it argued that the Targs were deligitmized but he claimed legitimacy as King by being descended from Targs. The real reason he was going to be King was because he won the war and he had the power, not because he had a legitimate legal reason. And the war itself was quite obviously predicated on the King and prince personally wronging him, the Starks, the Tully\'s, and the Arryns. It was prosecuted based on the fact that Robert, Ned, and Jon realized that they had 4 of the 7 Kingdoms on their side while another was going to sit out because its LP was still pissed at the Throne. Even Danny is confronted with the idea that her claim doesn\'t matter, her ability to march into Westeros and take it over does. Her claim is only important insofar as it makes it easier for lords that prefer her rule to declare for her, but honestly if she landed with three dragons and thousands of unsullied and Dothraki and pointed to them as her reason for taking the Throne she\'d get the same response. Does show Olenna declare for her because she believes in her claim, or because Cersei blew up her family and Danny   is strong enough to overthrow cersei?

In 1965, he co-founded the [progressive rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock) band [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd) with drummer [Nick Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Mason), keyboardist [Richard Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wright_(musician\\)) and guitarist, singer and songwriter [Syd Barrett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Barrett). Waters initially served as the group's bassist and co-lead vocalist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist and conceptual leader.\n\n>Pink Floyd subsequently achieved international success with the [concept albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album) *[The Dark Side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon)*, *[Wish You Were Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album\\))*, *[Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animals_(Pink_Floyd_album\\))*, *[The Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall)* and *[The Final Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Cut_(album\\))*. By the early 1980s, they had become one of the most critically acclaimed and best-selling acts in the history of popular music; as of 2013, they have sold more than 250 million albums worldwide, including 74.5 million units sold in the United States. Amid creative differences within the group, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their intended use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years had passed before he performed with them again.\n\n>Waters' solo career has included three studio albums: *[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pros_and_Cons_of_Hitch_Hiking)*, *[Radio K.A.O.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_K.A.O.S.)* and *[Amused to Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amused_to_Death)*. In 1990, he staged one of the largest and most extravagant rock concerts in history, *[The Wall\xa0– Live in Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_%E2%80%93_Live_in_Berlin)*, with an official attendance of 200,000. As a member of Pink Floyd, he was inducted into the US [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame) in 1996 and the [UK Music Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Music_Hall_of_Fame) in 2005. That same year he released *Ça Ira*, an [opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera) in three acts translated from [Étienne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Roda-Gil) and Nadine Roda-Gils' [libretto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libretto) about the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution).
