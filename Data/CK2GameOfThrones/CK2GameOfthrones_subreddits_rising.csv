3,e5kc21,How do I change Aegon's dynasty?,"Hey there. In my current playthrough I started at the War of the five Kings bookmark. After a while, Aegon of Essos invaded and fought against Joffrey. Somehow he lost that war. Now a few years later, Joffrey lost a rebellion and a great council was called to determine his successor. Aegon won that council and now is the king.
However, his dynasty still is ""of Essos"". Is there a way for me to change it to Targaryen? It just feels weird to me, to have the Iron Throne ruled by the ""of Essos"" house.",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e5kc21/how_do_i_change_aegons_dynasty/,2019-12-03 20:22:59

12,e5658b,Is there any way to have the outcome of the scenarios more book-like?,"Let me start by saying I absolutely love this mod and appreciate the hard work of the developers.


But is there any way to have the campaign play out more closely to the original story?

First I started a game as House Mallister during Roberts Rebellion and somehow managed to slay Walder Frey right in the beginning. The Rebellion itself ended with Benjen Stark becoming Lord of Winterfell after Neds death and so preventing the Stark children from ever existing.

Then I played as House Velaryon after Aegons Conquest. Aegon died childless, which led to a Martell becoming King of Westeros and the extinction of House Targaryan.


So is there anything I can do to prevent a total different outcome of the story while playing minor houses?",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e5658b/is_there_any_way_to_have_the_outcome_of_the/,2019-12-03 00:47:38
13,e55ib5,Trying to reforge Ice and having some problems.,"I'm King in the North.  The lord of the Westernlands has one valyrian steel sword and the King of the Iron Throne has the other.  Whenever I try to declare war to return artifact on the King of the Iron Throne, the only thing I can retrieve is the winter crown.

Any ideas?  I figured I would wait for the Iron Throne to go into a civil war and then declare war on the Westernlands and see if I could get at least one piece.

Any ideas on to get the other piece?",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e55ib5/trying_to_reforge_ice_and_having_some_problems/,2019-12-03 00:05:16
