Anyway Danaerys invaded right after but she was not a dragon rider so I easily beat her, the problem was that the whore got pregnant again, this time from faegon. This was not necessarily a problem at the beginning because I still had high support and got several naps betrothing my children with Margaery, but eventually the high septon excommunicated me and I was 'paralised' for 20 years because of the risk of some faction firing to put either faegon or his son on the throne, the only good thing that happened during this time was that eventually i beated Bran's crippled ass into submission.",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/bxb0d0/suggestion_if_you_killed_a_member_of_your_family/,2019-06-06 05:56:29

17,4szw8s,People seem to rely way too much on cheats to avoid any negative consequences or having to work for something on here.,"Like your really not playing the game properly if you just cheat to undo anything you don't like or get something you don't have. If you like Game of Thrones then surely you understand that actions have to have consequences, unexpected or not. Feel like people are making the game less fun for themselves.

Anytime someone asks something these days it's ""open console and..."". If people are asking how to do something, usually they want to figure out how to actually go about doing it in-game (e.g. win Robert's War as Rhaegar, get a vassal from another Lord you want on council, heir acting the bollocks).

I've only had this game a month so I still have so much to learn but that's the fun of it. Making mistakes and having things not to go to plan. That's what results in the cool/interesting/hilarious stories people end up posting on here, like Greatjon killing 3 dragons, Stannis becoming Pirate King of the Iron Islands or Jaime Lannister losing trial by combat to a random Frey.

I don't mind console for setting up weird events or like getting a dragon egg to see how that goes but don't rely on console to avoid playing the actual game.

29,226uy1,I have no idea whats happening and need to rescue Sansa (the young wolf),"Ok I'm playing as Robb Stark in clash of kings scenario and unlike history Renly doesn't become king and supports fucking Joffrey. So yea Loras starts invading me. My distraction army gets destroyed and surrounded by Kevans and Tywins army which was like 25k between harrenhall and riverrun. My distraction army was atleast 8k and escapes with 3k left and roose as the only highborn survivor (he pulled a duskendale and the others with him got captured). By the time my 18k army with robb reaches the twins to marry off Roslin the greyjoys attack. So i let Skaggos and white harbor take care of them. Through some freak accident I discover Arya stark and betrothed her to the vale idiot Robert Arryn. Then all of a sudden reach joins my side! So now storm lands, the crown and lannisters attack reach as mace manages to get close to kings landing a couple of times as I deal with grey joys and get south as fast as I can. By the time I make it mace's forces are diminished. I finish of Loras a couple of times and then my 15k gets squashed between Kevans and tywin lannisters army again just like roose as I was trying to reinforce him. All of a sudden tywin and Kevin get killed and I win with 11k men to pull off. Fucking miracle and I have the vale declare for me! Meanwhile up north I capture theon who was heading for winter fell and defeat Victorian and trust me that took a while with balon surrendering to me. Now me and the vale army go  destroying the imps and joffreys army left and right until we capture kings landing. By this time the reach and storm lands bled eachother dry and mace killed loras making renly turn into a vengeful executioner. The vale took most of the fighting to the westerlands so my army was relatively unscathed and I took kings landing with a breeze. Done I win the war right? No I got greedy I wanted the iron throne :( instead of accepting the iron thrones surrender I executed joffrey, Jaime and a couple of others. Forcing the war anew against tommen. I had to retake kings landing back. By this time tyrion made the white harbor and karstarks withdraw and the stormlands gotfraction of their army back, the vale dissolved into a civil war they were gauranteed to lose so I broke the bethrodal and all of a sudden 25k fucking army from dorne finally comes and attacks me! Urgh! Tyrion married tommen to a dornish princess for an alliance so I reload to the part wher my tommen war restarted and dorne hasn't reached me yet. The thing is I could gladly leave the crown lands and defend the north since winter is coming and they don't have a chance there or accept joffreys surrender but I want the family to be complete. I want sansa and at first she she was married to joffrey but after his execution she is married to some minor lord I never heard of in the crown lands. I just occupied his land but still cannot get her back? Am I wasting my time? What should I do to win the war? How come renly didn't rebel? Should I divorce my wife roslin who robb is in love with and vice versa to marry daenerys who has 3 dragons!? Or am I making a huge mistake? Still the main goal for me is Sansa! 

Other tidbits are Ramsay dying from an std, theon escaping, mace returning with an army enough to distract renly. Stannis taking advantage left and right taking over the weakened stormlands, crown lands and vale with his 3k army but its only a small territory to not make a difference, the lords declarent of the vale start declaring for me and allying with me. But their army got depleted during their civil war so I have to help them off a bit, and the wilding army took over the wall as the nights watch asked for help 3 times :p. Now only the cannibals of Skaggos stand in their way.",4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/226uy1/i_have_no_idea_whats_happening_and_need_to_rescue/,2014-04-04 17:52:35

31,4n8gxm,MAKE WESTEROS GREAT AGAIN! Ideas for Trump Sub Mod...,"A few quotes from The Donald: When Dorne sends it's people they are not sending their best. If Cersie Lannister can't satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy Westeros? An extremely credible source has sent me a raven telling me Roberts children are illegitimate. The concept of royal privilege was created by the Targaryens to make other great houses non competitive.  We will no longer surrender Westeros to the false song of ice and fire. I will knock the Faith Militant out so fast it will make your head spin. 

My ideas:
- Include his wife, sons and daughters(Ivanka better be hot and unmarried)
 - Start out with a small loan of a million gold dragons(he needs A LOT of money and prestige at least) 
- An event to build a wall on the Dornish border(YUUGGEE) if he takes the Iron Throne and kick them out.
- Give him the Vale and Sweetrobins titles during a Clash of Kings bookmark. Rename the Eyrie as Trump Tower.(House Arryn is pretty much dead anyway)
-  Donald Trump would have been one of the first to call Joffery out on his parentage, he should have an event where he can support Stannis or declare himself King.(many ideas)
- He should have a rivalry with Cersie, shes a criminal after all. Low Energy Stannis Baratheon, Lyin Baelish and that fat faced Lollys Stokewoth lol

This is just a few ideas out of the top of my head, list yours and perhaps we could make this an actual thing. The parallels between both worlds is remarkable.

36,3zifgc,"Cersei should have the ""slow"" trait","If Cersei, the dumbest major character in the show and books, is not considered ""slow,"" then how thick would a character have to be to be represented by that trait? Keep in mind that ""imbecile"" is a separate, more severe trait that applies to characters that are literally retarded, so I'd consider ""slow"" characters to be about one standard deviation from the norm. By this metric, Cersei certainly should qualify.

The POV chapters of Cersei in the books are often laugh out loud hilarious as the reader is actually privy to her ridiculous logic and delusions. Unlike characters like the Starks who make poor decisions because they have ethical qualms about certain courses of action, Cersei is amoral and her bad decisions are the result of pure stupidity.

In general I think that the devs did a very good job with the traits in this mod, but they were definitely too kind with the intelligence traits (Dany being quick, Tyrion being a genius, and no significant character that I can recall having the slow trait).

38,bqxtiu,[Spoilers],"**It was Never D & D Story to Tell**

&#x200B;

I understand that people are let down by the latest season of GOT. Emotions and theories aside most of the deep and meaningful story lines always were taken from the books. If GRRM ever finishes the books I do believe that fans of the story will be satisfied. Game of Thrones was always a Television show and it gave a Television show ending. 

&#x200B;

Many of us who were fans of the story kept trying to tell those that had not read the books that the books contain much more description and many more elements were left out of the show. It is not a coincidence that the show got worse after they passed the novels. 

Despite this season rushing the Dany story line, I thought they did a good job with what they had. The things that Television and Movies do that novels cannot is provide a Beautiful image of what people have imagined while reading the books. GOT accomplished that. That was one of the best Cinematic experiences I have ever seen on Television to date. As a matter of fact there have been spectacular images throughout the entire series.

&#x200B;

The story of Azor Ahai, the back story of the White Walkers, the children of the forest, what really turned Dany Mad, what Jon and possibly Tyrion and the Targaryen legacy and what that truly entails will be answered in the novels. I believe the fans of the show has misplaced anger. The show was only ever going to give us so much.

Came back executed hizdahr, married Edric storm (the last Baratheon) and won the war against yunkai. Of course since I decided to stay in meereen I had to go conquer all the other slave cities. Victorion arrived in meereen begging me to marry him but I declined. That asshole decided to use the dragon horn and steel viserion from me. Meanwhile the red priest worship me and I convert to the faith of R'hllor and become the chosen one. Edric wasn't fucking me right but I ended up having a son with Daario and a stillborn daughter, although Edric thinks the kids are his.  Anyways, as I'm sacking Lys win a 99% win I enter an inn. The inn happens to be a trap and explodes on me. Instead of dying I get resurrected by the red priest, sweet right?! Except 5 minutes later the same girl that tried killing me in the inn actually succeeds assassinating me. Of course Lys was the last city I needed to conquer before I could invade westeros, which I already prepared for by assassinating Tommen and Myrcella, hoping either Edric or me would get the throne. Instead there was a succession crisis and the corrupt high septic took the throne for himself.

I decided to fuck it and think that if i cant be king of dragonstone i will become king of another stone ""steppstone""  

Pirate bended their knee like alway 

I have many sons and not so many daughter kidnapped strong girl form beyond the wall and kidnap everyone who have good trait, because im god diplomat(100 dip)they didnt hate me and i seduced them so they loved me(I created my own harem full of sexy and genious girl) 

Finally some idiot take a bait and I created kingdom of dragonstone 

After seducing another girl being an pedophile by stealing some random noble daughter  see aegon leave my court with his hot sisters and imprisoned rhager(valyrian name is hard) who that i rescured by send letter to him ""give me my love or i will let my dragon eat you""so she decided that her pathetic brother isnt worthy for her and leave saath(aegon conquered talls man land form talls king because dragon are higher than them),I started planning to take blackwater hill because its would serve me as new capital of ~~british~~maritime valyria empire 

Suddenly I see some oppunity in westeros,Ironborn are being stomped by westerman reachman stromlander and evil tully(they are not content enough to wait for aegon to help them) 

I blazed their so called harrenhall and excuted last hoare(they all die in battle leaving their youngest member sit in harrenhall) 

Suddenly after I wrecked tully help fellow valyrian bro(they are valyrian at all)and going to kick lannister ass for being dishonorable scum

I have 2 choice now 

Choice 1:Restore Valyria

Your goal would be to have your lord gain as much land as possible, or cause as much havoc as you can if you play as a wild dragon.

48,5bdrxa,Fun Scenario I Created For Clash Of Kings,"War of Kings

Renly bends the knee to stannis. Reach and Stormland armies declare for stannis. Tywin forces Joffrey to surrender to Stannis and the Lannisters abandon Kings landing. They trade Sansa and Harrison Karstark for Jaime.

Once Tywin returns to the Rock he declares independence and disinherits all his children, banishing Jaime to the Golden Company. Cersei is forbid from marriage and locked in a maiden vault. I take away Joffrey's negative traits and squire him for the mountain, Daven Lannister, and Tywin. Once he's done I give him humble, midas touched, administrator, and Grey eminence. Once he's done Tywin legitimizes him as a Lannister and makes him his heir.

Joffrey is betrothed to a Blackfyre girl and Daven is married to another Blackfyre I created, and Tyrion is forced to marry a slow dwarf Bittersteel girl. (sometimes they fall in love)

Stannis gets Ice which was left thrusted inside the iron throne and inherits Robb's war for independence and is adamant he return as a LP otherwise they fight to the bitter end.

Theon doesn't pretend to kill the stark boys and returns to the isles for the kingsmoot where either he, Euron, or Victorian will win. If Theon wins I make him invade the reach which helps out Robb a little.

IF and when Aegon arrives. The Lannisters join his cause and if they win Tommen marries Shireen and inherits the stormlands.

Renly and Loras develop a feud with the new high septon and end up excommunicated. And margeary divorces Renly.

Willas marries Brienne....i just think it'd be cute.

Aegon marries Margeary and gains the Tyrrell Alliance.

SweetRobin dies of illness and Harry the heir inherits. Harry is then betrothed to Sansa and sends a token force to help out Robb.

Robb marries Roslin and I edit her a little to make her character better, Harrion Karstark and Jeyne Westerling develop a relationship and marry. Rickard is sent to the wall and Jon returns in his stead and marries Alys Karstark. Jon is given moat Cailan and legitimized.

Daven Lannister gets the castle of Cubeck. Janei lannister is betrothed to Edric Storm. Tyrion gets castamere.

Sometimes Doran will abandon all plots and declare his blood feud against the Lannisters. But usually Dorne will sit out the war.

Arya is found by the Starks and eventually marries Gendry. Given he survives the war.",2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/5bdrxa/fun_scenario_i_created_for_clash_of_kings/,2016-11-06 05:49:57

52,2vw4fv,Best. Robb. Playthrough. Ever!,"Ok, so i started and right away, Tywin dies. The Iron Islands don't declare war, so i can deal with the Lannisters. Then, i use a plot to kill Joffrey. Over 150% Then i use the same with Tommen. Both die. When Renly dies, i marry Margaery. When Mace dies, the Reach goes to Margaery. (Apparently, Loras, Garlan and Willas got greyscale. That sucks, but i got the Reach in my side. Then Myrcella gets the throne, but then i siege King's Landing and capture her. Problem? Daenerys invaded and destroyed my first army of 15k men. So, i try to let Daenerys, Myrcella and Shireen (Stannis died, go figure.) fight so that they won't be a threat. Then, Daenerys dies in childbirth and her daughter is stillborn. Then, Edmure dies in personal combat against the Mountain. So, cause Hoster died before him, guess who got the Riverlands? Me. So, i take my other two armies of 15k. With the Reach by my side, i take King's Landing again and capture Shireen who took it from Myrcella. I give the throne to Shireen but i remain independent. Then, after 7 years, i colonize Oldstones. I decided to give it to my second son, Brandon, but then i see that Margaery just had a bastard. So, i used charinfo to see if Brandon was really mine. Nope. Not one of the four kids is mine. Eddard, Brandon, Lyanna and Lyarra are bastards of Garth Greysteel, Leyton Hightower and Highgarden's septon. I decided to divorce Margaery and console command my ""sons"" to die. So, then i marry Gwyneth Yronwood. This time, my sons are mine. Cregan, Artos, Willam and Dacey are mine and Artos and Dacey got the Genius trait. Then, i decide to sail to the Smoking Sea hoping that Cregan will take over, cause Cregan was 14 already and married to a daughter of Darkstar, who through a claim got Starfall. Then, my vassal in charge of Harrenhal dies. I decide to keep it for myself, then Littlefinger's son Corwyn asks for my protection, cause Yohn Royce took Midlor Point from them and killed Littlefinger in personal combat. So, i say yes. They get Harrenhal. (Somethings never change.) I arrive at the Smoking Sea and with much luck, i get a dragon egg. I go to Volantis, the Citadel, King's Landing, Dragonstone and Harrenhal to try to hatch the egg. The try succeeds and a new dragon called Aetrox is born. So far, Drogon, Viserion and Rhaegal have all made lairs in Dragonstone and have gone wild. After a few years, i try to tame Aetrox and... I succeed. Robb Stark now is a dragon rider. I wait for a few years, so that Aetrox becomes a powerful dragon. With my dragon, i push the Dragon Conquest CB on the Reach and take it from Arlan Fossoway, who then, after i burned Highgarden, swears fealty to me and is confirmed as LP of the Reach. (Margaery died, then the Tarlys took the Reach and then the green apple Fossoways took it.) Then, i do the same to the Westerlands. The Lannister girl (daughter of Tyrion), fights back. But after i siege Crakehall, the Golden Tooth and Lannisport, defeating her armies, she surrenders and keeps her title of LP of the Westerlands. Then, i decide to do the same with the Vale. This time, the daughter of Harry the Heir surrenders without a fight. I then decide to take the Stormlands from Edric Baratheon(former Storm). Same as the Vale. He surrenders and keeps his title. Then, i push Dragon CB on the Iron Islands and Alekyne Florent surrenders and becomes the LP of the Iron Islands. (Don't ask, i'm confused about it too.) Then, i decide to look east. I conquer Lorath, Pentos, Norvos, Tyrosh, Lys, Qohor, Volantis and then Braavos. (I joined Tyrosh in an embargo war against Myr and the truce hasn't ended yet.) Then, i decide to conquer Dorne. Arianne tries to defeat me but i easily crush her. Then, i push Dragon CB in Mantarys, Tolos, Elyria, Meereen, Astapor, Yunkai, New Ghis, Naath and the Summer Islands. I form the Empires of New Valyria, Ghis and the Summer Sea. I make the ruler of Mantarys the new LP of New Valyria, a random guy of the Summer Islands the LP of the Summer Islands and another guy from Naath another LP. Finally, i decide to push Dragon Conquest on the Iron Throne who was currently occupied by Elmar Frey. (After Shireen's death, this guys had the throne, Godry Farring, Colmar Frey and Waltyr Frey before Elmar. So, he surrenders inmediately. I make new LPs in Andalos and in the Rhoyne. The King in the North controls pretty much everything. Actually the map just says The North, Zollo, Rakharo, Asshai and Qarth. I'll deal with the Dothraki first. then i'll tell you more, cause that's where i left it yesterday.",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/2vw4fv/best_robb_playthrough_ever/,2015-02-14 21:12:36

Do you think the words of House Reyne should be:

a) Hear me roar louder.

b) Cats of a different coat.

c) Never bow low.

d) A lion still has claws

If you ever wanted to play as a character in GRRM‚Äôs universe then this place is perfect for you!  If you enjoy CK2 and like telling your story that way, then this is a perfect extension and opportunity to do so!

We launched a about a month ago, and are developing into a very strong community with a very interesting, player-driven plot!  We are looking for players to join in on the fun and help develop the plot!  Currently, the realm is on the eve of war after the death of Queen Daenery's and disputes over who her heir should be.  A Grand Council is called to determine this, but nearly ends in bloodshed with no resolution.  In the aftermath, a King has arisen in the Iron Islands and another in the Westerlands.  The North is on the brink of a civil war and the Reach and Stormlands are facing their own internal conflicts.  What happens next is up to the players but one thing is for certain;  When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.  There is no middle ground.

There are plenty of characters and major houses available, so if you are interested please hop on over to our IRC and community sub to get acquainted and have any questions answered!

You can find us over at /r/IronThroneRP and at our [IRC Chatroom](http://irc.lc/darkmyst/IronThroneRP/IronThroneRP_@@@) Thanks everyone!

Has anybody here had a castellan's Improve Holding action succeed on a baron-level vassal in one of your counties?",5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/2eglx1/can_one_improve_the_holdings_of_baronlevel_vassals/,2014-08-24 22:23:41

114,7hxb6t,I don't like Valyrian Steel Swords as Artifacts,"As per the topic title, subjectively speaking, I don't like that Valyrian Steel Swords now use the artifact system. There, I said it. Maybe it's an unpopular opinion, but I must make my stance on this clear.

This change feels clunky and takes away from the exclusivity of the swords as a key feature of the mod. The fact the swords were treated as traits gave them a frame of exclusivity that the artifact system does not capture in full capacity, specially with the generic sword icons it now uses.

A Valyrian Steel Sword trait was something that immediately caught our attention the moment we saw it in a character sheet, as every ancestral sword was something that captured the spirit and legacy of the House that holds it. The fact the Devs grandfathered the old traits into a system that keeps track of the ancestral holders of Valyrian Steel Swords only solidifies for me the chunkiness of this change in its entirety.

However, as much as I dislike this change I won't ask the Devs to go back on their vision for Valyrian Steel Swords (nor do I feel they should take my feedback into account). Instead I'm going to revert this changes back to their former state in form of a submod, for my own use, as the way current things are now detracts from my personal enjoyment of this mod (which included tracking the holders of each sword and see how their House fares over the years).

Also, they were a lot easier to add to a character when doing console shenanigans.

That's all I wanted to say.

Edit2: Guess that settles it. Got a long weekend coming up but I'll see if I can strip the artifacts with a submod and share the product with whoever is interested afterwards.

Edit: This sub honestly amazes me sometimes. No, I did not say that the people of Ashai are the same as the real world people of India. And to whoever posted about the mods taking stuff from the vanilla...have you seen a cannon world map of ASOIAF? 

I was commenting on the fact that India and Ashai have the exact same geographical shape. I found this interesting because it ran with the themes of the rest of the world (though I just hadnt noticed it for like 3 years) like Slavers Bay being congruent with the shape of Greece, Westeros being a twisted version of Great Britain geologically, the ruins of Valyria mirroring the Leg of Italy, and the head of Sothoryos being the head of Africa. GRRM rarely takes any true self inspiration in creating his world map.

Proceed to win the war as Robert.

My plan worked, but with one key difference. Daenerys was born as a guy.

I know for CK2 standards that isn't anything to remarkable. I mean, there's a statistical chance she would be.

I mean, there are the obvious ones. Father of Dragons and such. But I'm going farther than that in my imagination.

Asha, instead of Euron, trying to marry a Targaryen, for example.

Daario is still a guy because I'm imagining he is bi for this situation enough. He's flamboyant enough. It can vaguely work in my mind.

Drogo realistically isn't, but I like to imagine he is and that Guynaerys is just a bottom (Power Bottom post ""Father of Dragons"") Wearing assless chaps in Pentos to impress him. ""You have a man's body now, brother.""

136,2dyqzn,A Stark fans wet dream (affc spoiler),"I don't even know how this happened but I love it. I started as Jon and accepted to be legitimized by Stannis so I become heir to Winterfell. I didn't marry Val and instead married Dany (thank God she lost the widowed trait). If you read my previous post here I did something similar but instead of splitting my hosts and sending one to Casterly Rock I kept him like two provinces behind the other host. As I was making my long march South I saw Stannis drew out the Lannisters and the Iron Throne army south to the Stormlands. When I checked I noticed Doran Martell has joines Aegon's war on Stannis. I used that to my advantage and rushed to King's Landing. I captured Tommen and got 100% warscore but Stannis couldn't enforce demands because a lot of his provinces were occupied so I had to take my 20k northmen down for a cleanup. 

After that was done Stannis ended the war. I guess Tommen became his prisoner because when his picture updated he was blinded :(. I was happy about how things turned out but boy I didn't expect what was going to happen next. 

After I won the war I also got an event which Stannis reforges Ice and gives it back so now I have VS swords :D

A few months passed and the event pops up that... Stannis died?? I wanted to see how that came to pass and it stated he was slain by Ser Loras the knight of flowers (he was lord commander of the kingsguard which makes it even more fucked up). Why would you follow in Jaime's foot steps Loras, why??? 

Well like two months later Dany gives me a dragon (Viserion). I was so happy but knew better than to try and tame it since I would risk my life. Then I had no choice... Viseryion kept burning Winterfell so it gave me barely any money and people were getting pissed off at me. I would make Dreadfort our new home but I was sort of roleplaying and Winterfell was the ancestral home to the Starks. Yea forgot to mention I executed all the Boltons and took Ramsay's bastard daughter as a prisoner. Anyways, Winterfell turning to rubble is really bad new for me so I try to tame the dragon. Didn't work no matter how much times I removed the maimed trait. So I got the idea to.... Console kill it.  Well now that is done I can live in peace in the ashes of Winterhell (Hot Pie knew all along!). Dany was actually giving me quite a lot of children and my heir was named Eddard who was a gluttonous craven but his brother Brandon was quick and attractive. 

Years later Brandon (my son) became skilled fighter and so did Eddard. During those years I pressed some claims (Owen claim on Craster's keep. I was bored so why not lol) he was immediately imprisoned and became the master at arms to the new lord of Craster's keep. Dany decided to give me another dragon. This time it's Rhaegal! Ok Viserys was a bitch but Rhaegar was kind of badass so I decided to tame the beast again. I tried everything to improve my chances (dragon pit, summer hall, dragon stone etc) and many reloads to previous save were had but to no avail ;_; 
I just went fuck it and used an event that tames the dragon in console command (yeah I know vanilla without cheats is more fun). 

I had a few daughters which all had pretty high diplomacy and intrigue. I wanted to see if I could declare bloody vengeance against the Freys but I had that CB but also... Dragon conquest? WTF AWESOME!! Ok I admit I don't really deserve it. 

I declared war on the Westernlands Tommen was the LP btw. He was fighting with Shireen Baratheon the 'delicate stag' who was queen of the iron throne. She didn't have grey scale which was kind of cool. I beat down Tommen badly so now the North has expanded! I'm like Aegon the conqueror reborn! Also I never knew the Summer Isles existed I only noticed it when zooming out. I have 30 hrs in this mod. I declared the conquest on them but they surrendered. I married Eddard to the heir to Dorne (although kind of unnecessary since I will take it with my dragon anyway). I haven't done anything yet but my plan is to take the Reach.

The said King Wallace Lannister invaded and conquered New Ghis. Things are going well for me ( I was planning to take the throne) but suddenly the unthinkable happens: The Aztec Empire invades Westeros..........

Guess what? The Leader of the Aztecs is Rickon Stark's grandson! They had like 150k men and took over the Iron Island first then invaded the Reach. I had 70k but the King was busy fighting the Dothraki so I had to make do, I've beaten bigger armies before and this would've been easy since they split their army in smaller ones. 

I take them on but guess what? THEY HAVE 20 DRAGONS WITH THEM. So after trying, failing and refusing to give in I turned to cheats, one year in game later Im King of the Iron Throne, Dragonrider, and my dungeon is filled with the Lords Paramount of all the 7 kingdoms.

Hello everyone!

I am a mod over at **r/IronThroneRP** a long running game set in the ASOIAF/Game of Thrones universe which is currently in the first few months of our second edition of the game!  We are a collaborative writing group focused on telling a story in a alternate scenario set seventy years after the books and have already ran a very successful campaign which lasted nearly a year! If you are interested in telling your own story through CK2 games, then you will find our game a nice transition as giving your own spin on the world is something everyone in our community loves to do! Our game has a focus on world building and storytelling but has mechanics in place to make things interesting and slightly *unpredictable* in aspects such as warfare, wealth, skills and espionage!  In addition we have a ‚ÄúCommon Man‚Äù character which acts as one of our game regulators, world-builders and primary use of game mechanics.   If you are interested in the ASOIAF universe and want to play a game with like-minded people then this community will be great for you!

We are several months into our second edition of the game, and so far the actions has been aplenty.  The king was recently murdered by an unknown assailant leading to a period of strife and high tensions in light of an unpredicable regency that would follow.  There has been murders and tension aplenty already and it only looks to continue as forces in the South, North and to the East all look to move.   The limit to character creation is really your imagination and what you are willing to create with other players.  There are lots of major and minor positions open, and a link to open houses can be found [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D_AvJyi_c5KCMnVE7WOGzhIHSHvDvrZoe_Ny318NJWk/edit?usp=sheets_home) but you are free to create a family member from a claimed house if you wish!

If you are interested, please check out our [**Welcome Thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/comments/3gymjz/welcome_to_iron_throne_rp/) which should give you all the details you need!  Our game envisions to put the power of storytelling into the hands of the players and to promote a fun and healthy community which can build off of each other.  If you are interested in creating a character, or wish to check out more information on our game please check out our community sub at **/r/ITRPCommunity**.   Also if you have any questions at all or are interested in joining feel free to pop in by our [**chatroom!**](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.darkmyst.org/ironthronerp)  We would love to meet you!

Thanks everyone, hope you are having a good day! :)

151,32s029,Iron Throne RP,"#/r/IronThroneRP

Hey everyone!  I‚Äôm a mod over at [Iron Throne RP](http://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP) a text-based roleplay based in the Song of Ice and Fire universe!  If you ever wanted to play as a character in GRRM‚Äôs universe then this place is perfect for you!  I came from this place from CK2 games, in which I loved explaining my story to others!  If you enjoy the roleplaying aspect of the games, then you will fit right in!

We launched almost 6 months ago, and are developing into a [very strong community](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/) with a [very interesting, player-driven plot!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/comments/2qbr0v/welcome_to_iron_throne_rp/)  We are looking for players to join in on the fun and help develop the plot!  So far, the realm is on the eve of war after the death of Queen Daenerys and disputes over who her heir should be.  A Grand Council is called to determine succession, but ends in bloodshed and with no resolution.  In the aftermath, a King has arisen in the Iron Islands and another has risen and fallen in the Westerlands.  The North is on the brink of a civil war, a King has appeared in the Reach, all in while Dorne, the Vale and the Stormlands face their own internal and external conflicts.  Now, the former king has abdicated his throne as another takes his place as a rebellion of the faith appears imminent.  A full scale war could blow up at any time.  What happens next is up to the players but one thing is for certain;  When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.  There is no middle ground.  If you enjoy GOT/ASOIAF you will love this place!

There are plenty of characters and major houses available, so if you are interested please hop on over to our IRC and community sub to get acquainted and have any questions answered!  We like dynamic characters so the limit in character creation is your imagination!  Check out [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/comments/2npu0q/character_creation/) to create a character and click [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/comments/2pc92r/npcs_and_abandoned_pcs/) or [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ITRPCommunity/comments/2pcfwl/classifieds/) to get a feel for what types of characters are available!

To get started and learn more about us, check out our [Welcome Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IronThroneRP/comments/2qbr0v/welcome_to_iron_throne_rp/).  Our subreddit can be found over at /r/IronThroneRP and /r/ITRPcommunity.

167,4uunhg,1.2. Wildling issues,"Used submods: More Decisions, Colonize Valyria, More Bookmarks, Challenge to Duel.

Starting as the Magnar of Thenn in the Conquest of Dorne bookmark, I allowed thousands of wildlings across the Wall. I've beaten the Targaryens, I've beaten the Northmen, Winterfell is mine, come and see.

I created High Lordships and gave them to loyal Thenns. When they die without a strong heir, I can't recreate those duchies because I have no demesne in them. I'm slowly but surely climbing towards my vassal limit, come and see. When I played as a pirate, such titles were inherited by me, not destroyed... I suggest using the same here. Note: when a pirate has a Valyrian blade and loses the duchy on succession, the sword also disappears like fart on the wind. Maybe that's a bug.

I conquered the Wall, gave it's baronies to good Thenn, and made a Merchant Republic out of the duchy with Moletown as capital, come and see. From time to time, a dumb AI baron vassal educates his kid with local culture and religion (Heritage focus), and without a warning a barony is given back to the Night's Watch. I think this should not happen. 

My current character's half-brother also seems to have inherited a patrician house there, but he's back in my court, landless courtier, has feudal govt. type, but if I land him he becomes a republic for some reason, come and see.

Wildling Revolts: Half of them have bugged names on announcement, and their leaders have wierd names like [appropriate Wildling/Thenn/Hornfoot/Frozen Shore name] of [completely inappropriate holding from half a world away, as far as Yunkai - no Thenn sailed there, even with a vassal republic at my disposal], come and see. Also, what are the requirements for those revolts? They keep happening even in Thenn religion, 0% revolt risk counties beyond-the-Wall.

Repaying loans to the Iron Bank is completely bugged, come and see. Whenever a vassal of mine dies and I inherit, I get the event to pay back their debt of 62 gold, even when they had no debt at all. Hell, when my character dies, his heir gets the event, and I definitely had no debt.

Wildlings, Hornfoot and Frozen Shore have their own culture group, Free Folk. WHY? Everyone above the Neck is First Men in origins, except the Manderlies but even they assimilated. Northmen, Crannogmen, Mountain Clansmen of the North and the Vale, Clawmen, Former Southrons and the F*cking Thenn can be the same culture group, but not the rest of people living North of the Neck? Even if they are First Men in the books? As the example of the Thenn shows, they can still use the mod's wildling mechanisms if they are in the culture group they belong. And their haters would still hate them because of Wildling -50, just not Foreigner -10.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/4uunhg/12_wildling_issues/,2016-07-27 17:40:51
168,4pw3lu,[Spoilers All] Keeping The Starks Out Of The North,"[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/o5XRn)

So from Robert's Rebellion start as Rhaegar.

A little back story. Ser Barristan did me the great favor of killing The Mad King. Chased the main Stormlander force all over southern Crownlands. Beat them three times, forcing Robert out of command and back to Storm's End. Really helped when Jon Arryn died of natural causes early in the rebellion and the new LP of the Vale had no appetite for the war. Robert was captured after a siege. Sent him to the wall. Revoked the Stormlands from Renly and gave it to Connington.

Let Holster bend the knee.

Eddard refused imprisonment so a second war but the Riverlands and the Vale both threw in with the crown so pretty easy. Imprisoned the whole Stark clan.

Now Lyanna died in childbirth. I legitimized our child. So in my playthrough R+L=D. I revoked the North from Eddard and gave it to our son Daeron. 

Here's where I screwed up. After sacking the North and imprisoning the Starks I let Catelyn go. So I've got Eddard still in prison, with exile and execute and ransom and release as options. And I've got Eddard and Catelyn's oldest son in prison, Torghen.

Incredibly Holster and Edmund died in quick succession in the Riverlands and the eldest Stark child, Torghen, who I've got in prison, suddenly becomes Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. Meanwhile, even though my son Daeron has the North the Starks are the succession line. To make matters worse I assume Moat Cailin and Winterfell will likely fall into the Riverlands realm when Eddard dies and Torghen inherits. 

I can easily do away with Eddard and Torghen but since she's been out of prison Catelyn has had two other sons with Eddard who are out of my control and who sit in line for both the North and the Riverlands.

I've been plotting a long time to kill Torghen's younger siblings to no avail.

So, some advice. If I want to keep the Starks at bay as a major threat do y'all think I should just revoke the Riverlands and take the hit for executing both Ned and his eldest son? That will leave the remaining Starks with just Winterfell and Riverrun and Moat Cailin. And then I'll just hope that my son, Daeron, the LP of the North, survives to adulthood and produces an heir. Is there maybe a better option to keep the Starks from kingdom level titles?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/4pw3lu/spoilers_all_keeping_the_starks_out_of_the_north/,2016-06-26 08:08:29

You either need to play as one of the regular guys, or cheat your arse off to get started.

War starts, I was on King Aery's side, raised my banners 3k men and marched through the Stormlands. I was essentially just sieging the counties as much as I can. it actually went to 39%, and I think Tywin joins a side after 40%. Then something happened and it started declining. and when it was a lost cause I decided to turn against the crown and go for the rebells through the intrigue tab. Scumbag Randyll pretty much.

After the rebels won, civil war broke out right after having the Reach and Dorne claiming to be king. Once that was won, I asked to be the new LP of the Reach, (Thanks Bobby B.)

I had two kids during the war, Same and his Sister. Sam had the quick trait so I wanted to marry him to a chick with quick as well (didnt turn out that great). Sam surprised me he was a Brilliant Strategist and a level 2 fighter. He had a Martial of 23 by the end of it with Brightbane. I matrilenially married my daughter to prince Viserys (wierd I know, so 2 of my grandchild has white hair. (I plan to marry them off to keep the white hair and incestially marry Sam's heir to their 2nd cousins so Tarly will have Fair Haired lineage.

236,4z464y,Problem with Season 6 Submod,"I installed the files properly (I think), because the book mark popped up and i started a game (with Jon Snow) with no issue. But once I couldn't arrange a marriage, appoint council members, and then when I started to let the days start coming by I got a bunch of events with no texts and no buttons to dismiss them. 

Has anyone had this problem? Did I do something wrong? How do I fix this? Thanks in advance.

237,4ys05w,Does anyone know the event code for hatching a dragon egg?,"So I ran into a little problem while playing as Rhaegar. I got the dragon egg from Summerhall but the decision to hatch it is greyed out. I SHOULD be able to hatch the dragon, I'm not at war, holding a tourney or any other activity that stops you from hatching the egg. AND I have all the dragon lore locations (Kingslanding, Dragonstone, Field of Fire etc.) but the decision is still greyed out. Maybe some files or something went missing between my last save and this one I don't know. I am not running any submods that mess with the dragon egg hatching events (I do have the dragon tamers submod but I left it off during this save). I'm running More Decisions, Congenital Overhaul, More Bookmarks (I started during the Year of the False Spring) and my building submod, all of which as far as I know don't mess up the dragon egg hatching events. 

So I've decided to cheat if necessary in order to hatch a dragon. So if anyone knows the event code for hatching a egg could you post below? Thanks :)",3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/4ys05w/does_anyone_know_the_event_code_for_hatching_a/,2016-08-21 03:56:18

239,4sj1cq,Declared war as an emperor and all kings became independent.,"Ok, so my first time with the mod.  I'm not a regular reader or  show watcher, just a CK2 fan.

I created a kingdom in the Stepstones and took the islands around Sothros, declaring an empire shortly after.  About twenty years of raiding later, I had enough coin to pick off the first of the Summer Isles... except the moment I declared war on them my two vassal kings became independent.  While they did join me in the war (where they were useless, thanks AI) they remained independent even at peace once the war was over.  

Is this something that's common?  Or is there some decision or game mechanic I'm not familiar with?

Also I don't know if Jon should be given chaste or lustful since he is kind of both. Rhaegar Targaryen should have genius instead of quick since Rhaegar's intelligence awed the maesters. Also there should be an event that grants characters like Arya the trait fair since Arya is said to look like Lyanna and Lyanna was beautiful. Also Arya and Lyanna should both have quick since Arya says she is great at sums and running of a household (since Arya is Lyanna incarante Lyanna should have the trait as well). ,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/4m7unh/missing_traits_and_traits_that_need_fixing/,2016-06-02 19:58:44

1) Wrote a description for the trait in A Game of Thrones/ common/ traits

2) Made the corresponding localisation file

3) Made a skinchanger icon and placed it on A Game of Thrones\gfx\ traits. I've tried with .dds and .tga

4) Created a .gfx file in A Game of Thrones\interface\traits which ended up like this:

    spriteType = {

     texturefile = ""gfx/traits/skinchanger (I've tried also with skinchanger.dds and skinchanger.tga)

     norefcount = yes
     effectFile = ""gfx/FX/buttonstate.lua""

Except my goal this play-through was to keep the north independent from the soon to be iron throne led by Aegon the conqueror. This is the history of Aegon's conquest,  during Aegon's Conquest of Westeros he had many massive battles. The first of which was against the King of the Stormlands who had constantly declined Aegon's request of the king's daughter to marry his brother but not only did the Storm King did he insult Aegon. He sent back the corpse of the messenger this sent a rage into the dragon's heart and they say this is what kindled the flame of the dragon's conquest. After quickly decimating the stormland's host. Aegon quickly moved onto the reach, King Loren of the rock joined King Mern IX of the Reach in defense of their ancestral home and both of their hosts met up at hammerhal. Their army was 50,000 men strong. As they saw aegon's armies approach they thought the day had already been won for they saw they out numbered Aegon 5 to 1 but then right as the battle began Aegon unleashed the might of all three of his dragons 10,000 men were instantly burned alive.

While Loren came out with severe burns then after aegon conquered the reach and the Westerlands he moved onto the iron isles and roasted the black king, in his black castle, with his black armies.

274,2w3s8i,My wolrd in 8377..,"So I played as the harlaws, after raiding and getting a lot of money I got enough to hire mercinaries to wipe out the exhausted greyjoys to become king of the iron islands, hatched a dragon, basically conquered half of westeros + the iron throne. After the conquest of the Harlaws there happened a lot, a LOT, a LOT of wars. Most of those were ones that I tried to get rid of lannisters and plotters. Unfortunately, after a line of incest (I enabled marry_anyone) my dynasty took up the faith of the seven, so no more drowned god.

Here are the lord paramounts in 8377:

Iron Throne: Kenned Harlaw (Me)
Stormlands: A Frey
Riverlands: Another Harlaw
Dorne: Farwynds (and apparently they had wars with the Martells who are in charge of Lonely Night lol)
Vale: Some random bastard (literally)
North: Starks
Westerlands: Lannisters
Reach: Tyrells
Iron Islands: Some Stonetree woman after rebelling against my brother, now I am trying to put him in charge.


Fun facts/events: The lord paramount of the north is Owen Stark, Rickon's son (he died as a blinded cripple).
Brandon Stark died in battle against Jojen Reed (after ACOK)
Joffrey's and Sansa's children brought me tons of trouble, and their grandchild is in charge of the Westerlands now. 

Other crazy shit involved Volmarks getting the westerlands before the lannisters wiping out the entire family and the freys having lords in each one of the 7 (or 8?) kingdoms.

289,3eopel,"(No spoilers) The Tale Of Luthor Varner, The Blind Weasel.","Hey everyone! This is part two of my blind warrior playthrough.
 Here is a link to part 1: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/3e33kk/the_tale_of_luthor_varner_the_blind_weasel/


sorry for all the deletes and reposts, a new rule was enacted that I was ignorant of and failed to follow on my first post. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

March 2, 8291; a raven arrives with news from Highgarden. Since the last time Luthor was in the capital Lord Randyll Tarly has been outed as a dishonorable wretch who uses murder to obtain his goals. This only served to enforce luthor‚Äôs idea that he should be Lord Tyrell‚Äôs master at arms. It did make him worry though, that the next friendly duel between them might not be as friendly as the last time they met. As time wore on and Luthor marched to Highgarden, his wife Olenna gave birth to a daughter. With him away, she named the girl Estalia after Luthor‚Äôs grandmother.


On October 21, 8291 Luthor arrived at Highgarden and immediately sought out Tarly for a duel. Unless he was in service to his lord, Luthor intended to make his stay in Highgarden as short as possible. He made his intentions to replace Tarly as master at arms very clear to everyone of import in the capital, and as such Tarly was obliged to accept the challenge.
Yet again the duel was met at midday and the two men started off circling each other warily. Luthor made the first move and attacked lightning quick, forcing Tarly off balance. The man responded well however, and quickly regained his footing and hammered the pummel of his sword into Luthor‚Äôs face. Without stopping to wince, Luthor spun away from Tarly so he could reengage with a better advantage. As the two men circled once more, Luthor felt warm, sticky blood travelling down his neck and underneath his armor. Tarly had cut him across the neck! Luthor was shocked. He did not even feel the blade score his flesh. The blood flow was steady but minimal. The wound was not fatal, but it made Luthor reevaluate his ability to combat Heartsbane without a weapon of similar quality.


After quick consideration, Luthor lowered to one knee and surrendered, hoping that Tarly would avoid murdering him with so many witnesses around. Randyll lowered his weapon and gave Luthor a hand up as he accepted the surrender.


‚ÄúLord Randyll, your weapon is a truly magnificent tool. I truly would love to own a weapon of such quality and fame someday.‚Äù


Tarly said nothing in return, and strode away from Luthor. It became apparent to Luthor that without a valyrian sword, it was unlikely that he would succeed against Tarly. As it was now, he had lost twice to the man, and the ability to replace him as Lord Tyrell‚Äôs master at arms seemed like a dwindling possibility. Luthor returned home, but this time he did so with less enthusiasm as he had the last.


A month after his return, Luthor was invited to join another tournament, this time hosted by Lord Olyvar of Longtable. He was excited to wash away his recent defeat with a few victories of his own. As Olyvar‚Äôs herald announced Luthor‚Äôs first tilt was to be against Ser Canther, a courtier in Roseford. Luthor had met the man many times and knew he was a knight in name only. The man was a poor fighter and spent more time with his plots and plans than he did with a sword. As they took up places in the lists, Luthor brushed his hand against his neck and felt the sting of his recent wound. It had yet to heal, and Luthor surmised that wounds by Valyrian steel lasted longer than those of regular steel. Luthor reached down and took his lance, and prepared for the signal to ride.


Luthor‚Äôs horse Fulweather reared as he kicked it into a gallop when the signal flag fell. His horse thundered across the ground as he moved ever closer to his opponent. Ser Canther missed his thrust completely as he was lifted from the saddle by Luthor‚Äôs attack. The victory for Luthor was a hollow one. He took no enjoyment in unfair competition and received no sense of pride or glory unhorsing a man who barely understood combat. Luthor was equally disappointed when his next opponent was announced. Ser Russell Hutcheson, a nephew to Luthor‚Äôs father in law. The man was skilled in diplomacy but not much else. Russell held on tightly as Luthor attempted to unhorse him three times. Luthor was slightly less sour after this victory because Russell at least had the strength to withstand three separate lance strikes. Still though, he was unsatisfied with this combat also.


Luthor‚Äôs next opponent was Lord Desmond Caswell of Bitterbridge; yet another knight in name only. Luthor was beginning to feel that no matter how many opponents he beat to win this tournament; it would not feel like a victory to him. He realized then that he enjoyed the excitement of combating men like Randyll Tarly. He took a great deal of pleasure in the rush of uncertainty that came with fighting equally skilled men. Just thinking about his recent duel was enough to get Luthor‚Äôs blood rushing faster. He waited with eagerness for the flag to drop, and then pushed Felweather into a charge.


When Luthor came to, he was lying face up in a multicolored tent. He sat up on the cot he was placed on and looked around. Waldon, Luthor‚Äôs father in law and master at arms, was seated near the entrance to the tent. He rose as he heard the shuffle of Luthor rising to stand.


‚ÄúYou underestimated him didn‚Äôt you, my lord?‚Äù


‚ÄúI did. I don‚Äôt feel injured, has a maester been by?‚Äù


‚ÄúAye, said nothing was broken. You just had the wind knocked out of you. I could see the disappointment on your face all day today. Thought you were being matched up against lesser men, did you?‚Äù


‚ÄúYes, Waldon, I did. I would appreciate it if you did not lecture me at present. I am in no mood to suffer further wounds today.‚Äù


‚ÄúVery well my lord. You have finished an honorable second. I have your purse here and the horses are stabled and ready outside.‚Äù


‚ÄúYou may keep the purse, Waldon. I will consider it payment for my arrogance. Let us return home at haste; I miss my wife.‚Äù


After Luthor had returned home, days rolled by and he spent most of them with his children. His wounds from his last duel with Tarly had still not yet closed completely, but when Lorent Caswell of Bitterbridge invited him to a tournament, Luthor felt obligated to compete yet again.


He was determined not to prejudge his opponents this time. He would view each person as a challenge and of equal measure to his own skills. His first opponent was Ser Willam Wythers, a knight who was currently in training to become a maester. Luthor found this to be strange given the man‚Äôs talent for swordplay. The two men shook hands in a warrior‚Äôs grip before mounting and riding to their places on opposite sides of the arena. Lord Lorent shouted for the match to begin and both men rode hard towards the other. As Willam and Luthor closed the gap, Luthor pushed his lance forward and tilted his body slightly. Willam barely hit Luthor with a glancing blow whereas Luthor struck the learned knight with full force. The scholarly knight flew from the saddle and landed on the ground unharmed but out of breath.


Luthor dismounted and helped the man regain his footing. As Willam regained his footing he leaned in very close to Luthor and spoke into his ear.


‚ÄúYour brother is in trouble. Someone at the Citadel is plotting to have him killed. I don‚Äôt know many details. We will speak again soon. ‚Äú


Willam proceeded to push Luthor away from him and began yelling that he had only lost because his opponent was lucky.


With this new information, Luthor‚Äôs mind was racing. He moved mindlessly back towards his horse and rode from the arena. He knew he did not have enough information for any true speculation, but he was still unable to focus on anything but the information he had just received. Someone called out to him and informed him he was due to ride again immediately.


Luthor approached the arena again, albeit hesitantly. He did not know the man he sat across the lists from. He didn‚Äôt bother to ask. He was operating mechanically and was still very distracted. Unbeknownst to him, Willam sat in the stands watching him with a smile on his face.


Even without total presence of mind, as Lord Lorent shouted for the battle to commence, Luthor rode hard and knocked his opponent from the saddle. The man was unharmed, and Luthor rode back to his place in the lists and waited for his next enemy.
‚ÄúLord Willas Tyrell and Lord Luthor Varner.‚Äù Said the herald.


The information shook Luthor back to the task at hand. His mind was refocused and he prepared himself to face his liege‚Äôs son. He wondered if unhorsing Willas would help or harm his chances of becoming the master at arms of Lord Mace. In either case, Luthor was not prepared to lose on purpose.


The two men kicked their horses into a gallop. When they met, Willas struck only a glancing blow, but Luthor shattered his lance on Willas‚Äô armor. The man clung to his saddle well and prevented himself from being unhorsed. They prepared to ride once more. Yet again Luthor struck his opponent with full force and this time Willas flew from the saddle. Luthor dismounted and moved to check on his opponent. Willas was unharmed and Luthor helped the man to his feet.


‚ÄúA fine blow Lord luthor.‚Äù Said Willas.


‚ÄúThank you my lord. I am honored to have tilted against you.‚Äù Luthor responded.
The two men shook hands and left the arena. Luthor waited near the stands for his next call to arms, and during his down time more lancers were called to compete. Luthor was taken aback slightly when he heard Randyll Tarly‚Äôs name called to the lists. He was to oppose Ser Leo Tyrell. Luthor was unfamiliar with the man, but hoped for a good showing. His hopes were not long held as he heard Tarly had unhorsed the Tyrell man on his first pass.
‚ÄúLord Randyll Tarly and Lord Luthor Varner.‚Äù Shouted the herald.


Luthor was excited now. His blood began to flow much more quickly and he could feel the adrenaline surging through his body as he mounted Fulweather. The two men stared intently across the arena at each other, waiting for the signal to ride. When the signal came both men rode with determination.


Luthor felt a sense of elation as he struck Tarly and avoided his enemy‚Äôs lance. His elation elevated to accomplishment when he realized he had unhorsed the man in one strike. Tarly was unharmed, and returned to his horse and rode from the arena without a word. Lord Lorent announced that Luthor was the victor of the tournament and paid the man fifty gold in winnings.


On his return trip home, Luthor and Ser Waldon rode together, and Luthor told his friend about the plot against his brother at the citadel. Waldon seemed unconvinced and suggested that it may have been a tactic used by Willam to unnerve him and force Luthor to lose in future matches. Luthor was not so sure, and intended to look into the matter once the two men returned home. Just before the two men crossed back into their home province some armed men approached them from the trees.


‚ÄúI count six men, three ahead and three behind.‚Äù Waldon informed Luthor.


‚ÄúI‚Äôll take the three behind us.‚Äù Luthor responded.


The two men drew their swords and dismounted. Luthor stood perfectly still; his eyes closed. He listened for his would-be killers‚Äô footsteps. He could hear the breaking of twigs and the shuffle of grass. He heard rushed footsteps coming at him from the front. As the man approached Luthor heard the sound of the wind parting before the edge of the man‚Äôs sword. Luthor reacted instantly by side stepping and grabbing the man‚Äôs arm as it slashed down harmlessly on Luthor‚Äôs right. He speared the man through the chest with his own blade. He focused his hearing once more and heard the other two men approaching quickly. They intended to attack simultaneously. Luthor reacted quickly; as the man approaching on his right slashed his weapon downward, Luthor moved the body of the dead man he still held between himself and the incoming attack. The sword slashed down and buried itself in the dead man‚Äôs flesh. Luthor kicked the body loose from his own blade and it toppled backward, falling onto his second attacker. Luthor swung just in time to block the third attacker. As their swords locked together, Luther kicked out at the man‚Äôs knee. He heard a howl of pain come from the man just before Luthor ran him through with his sword.


‚ÄúWaldon, are you okay?‚Äù Luthor called out. Stopping all movement so that he could hear what was happening behind him.


‚ÄúMy three are dead.‚Äù Said Waldon.


‚ÄúI have kept one alive, so you may question him.‚Äù Luthor said.


Luthor could hear Waldon wipe the blood from his weapon on the clothes of the dead, and he did the same. Waldon disarmed the last enemy, and questioned him at length. After nearly half an hour, the man revealed that Ser Willam Wythers was behind the plot to have Luthor killed. In anger, Luthor killed the man. Waldon avoided making any judgmental comments. He could see his lord was in anguish and did not comprehend why someone would stoop to such low methods of operation.


‚ÄúWe are going to figure this out, Waldon. When everything is said and done, I will see Willam brought to justice.‚Äù

I got a new SSD and decided to move all my games to the new SSD. I installed CK2 with Steam on the new SSD and it works fine.

324,3fa081,[No Spoilers] How does the Valyrian Steel quest work?,"It's not about the riddle but rather about the mechanics. How am I supossed to answer the riddle properly when the only way to see the other options (wolves, crows, dogs) is to click over one of the eagles, even when they're not part of the answer?.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: Ok, I think I got it.

For the people who don't understand the quest:

THE RIDDLE: It's different every time but at the end of the day its just simple maths. Just read the riddle carefully and subtract the dead animals. For example..

""Near a tree by a river there`s a hole in the ground,
7 direwolves fight 5 dogs while 2 eagles fly around and around.
6 direwolves died while killing the 5 dogs in the veil of the night
While one eagle was killed by a crow in a terrible fight""

TRANSLATION: 1 direwolf, 1 eagle, 1 crow.


THE PILLARS: This is the tricky part, and what brought me a lot of problems. 
The rotative pillar mechanism used in this quest is based in Skyrim's puzzles. Seen in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCtdVIRhBJU

If you are used to think from CK2's ""event perspective"" [if you click it, you select it], you need to start thinking from Skyrim's ""puzzle perspective"". As SCirish843 said in the comments: ""The pillars are 4 sided, whichever animals are left with(1 of each) you'll just click the same pillar until it rotates all the way around until you find the animal you want.""

Before moving on to the next event by choosing the ""rotate lever"" dialog option, you need to configurate the pillars matching the results of the riddle. 

At first you see 3 eagles, don't mind them. Click on those eagles over and over again until you have the desired configuration, matching numbers and animals according to riddle. Then rotate the lever.",11,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/3fa081/no_spoilers_how_does_the_valyrian_steel_quest_work/,2015-07-31 15:17:55

328,33ikki,new littlefinger playthrough,"So I started a new campaign with petyr in the ffc bookmark and by far this is my best campaign ever. 

I married lady sansa and made seduction my focus. While i waited till the wars where over and I would get the riverlands I decided to fuck with the king a little. I seduced tommens wife margarey and had 3 kids with her (king never knew so my bastard child was the next king.). after this I thought why not fuck with the queen mother so i impregnated cersei.

After this I got most of the riverlands took me a year to get it all . Then I declared war to give lady sansa the north and won. even with all my lovers she was also one of my lovers and always had a 100 opinion of me. Around this time tommens sister came of age and impregnated her to :).

now a megawar started when dany invaded the iron throne. after a bloody war she died in a dungeon and a random dothraki tamed Rhaegal, so I married her to a courtier of mine and landed them. She was very usefull. then little finger died and my son eddard baelish took over.

I waged war with the westerlands for a piece of trident land and won and at the same time my mother sansa died of depression and I inherited the north. (still playing this game with eddard)

After this i declared a war of independence and won with a bit of luck. my char also inherited the attractive trait and I married a genius girl so my new heir is a genius. after a few peacefull years (and fucking my father's bastard daughters) the dothraki bitch died. Rhaegal nested in harrenhall and after a gift of 20 gold he had 50 opinion of me. I saved in case i needed to reload but I didn't have to, on my first try I tamed Rhaegal yeah me right? .

So now i was independent formed the kingdom of the trident and had a dragon on my side. when the iron throne was at war with the westerlands and the reach i declared war on the vale who surrendered without a fight. right after i declared war on the kingdom of the iron isles and won after easy battle. 

My kingdom continues to grow with the north, riverlands, the vale and the iron isles in my kingdom. after 2 more years the iron throne lost and the lp of the westerlands became king. they where so weakened by the years of war so i declared on him with 130k troops and my dragons. My troops weren't needed since the iron throne surrendered. only dorne remains independend and will soon be mine.

made the iron throne my prim title and breeding baelish's to made into my lp's wondering what to do next :) since i got so much in only my second generation (my char alone has 7k prestige from all the wars i won :D )

333,3lfoj8,[No Spoilers] Pollinate 3: Gods and Men and Lesbian Quarter-Dragon Summer Islanders,"Dear god. What have I wrought upon this world? What eldritch abominations have Rhaeynra's descendants brought upon the face of this unsuspecting populace? What kind of gods would allow such horrifying overlords to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting populace? 

Gods who console the hell out of the pollinate and cuckoo cheats, that's who! :D Mwehehehehe.

For those who never read these, let me get the background out of the way for what for what I'm doing. I started in the Dance of Dragons scenario as Rhaeynra. This is a completely cheatsy game because it's more of an unspeakable breeding experiment in Westeros and Essos than it is an actual game. Through trial and error I worked to find everything that could pollinate everything. Here's the trick: if it's female (either a human female or a dragon female), ANYTHING with a character id...male, female, giant, dragon, human, RUIN, white walker, winter wasteland, ETC, can impregnate it. I have used this liberally through several generations of Targaryen (and other dynasties) and taken over virtually every piece of land in the world and put in charge the horrible bastard progeny I produced with them. More details in the first two parts. You think that run someone did with the Andal incest family was messed up? You haven't seen anything yet. I have created so many bastards from so many Targaryens and random courtiers with each other and everything the world is basically full of probably a thousand people related to everyone else somehow. My Targ dynasty alone has nearly a thousand members! I hope I can have a photo fest of some of the best of the worst next post. Here's to get you caught up:

http://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/2mzmwc/pollinate_a_targaryen_adenture/
http://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/2oztk3/pollinate_2_electric_dragon_boogaloo/

Now, that you're already in the know or are read up to being in the know, let's get me to the present. I am a fifth generation ruler and have taken my place the first time as a male (I only played female rulers previously to maximize pollinating myself and others)-- Moredeon Targaryen, King of the Iron Throne, God-Emperor of Leng, and the ruler of pretty much everything at this point. There are so many claimants to my throne I generally have to fight a host war every month or so.

Technically, given my lineage was actually true up to this point, I'm like an eighth actual dragon (Rhaeynra had sex with the Dragon Cannibal way back when I started), an eighth yi-ti (Rhaeynra also had sex with a random Yi-Ti courtier woman and had a daughter I played who married the half-dragon son), a quarter high valyrian, and half Lysene , because I impregnated my mother with a Lysene woman named Moredea (see what I did there with the name? har har) and cuckoo'd it so my dumbass Leng father (who's actually secretly a Targ bastard himself) thought I was his. And my child isn't even Targ at all--it's a cuckoo'd quarter-northerner (Umber), quarter east-valyrian, half-lysene boy. He came from my secretly half-sister wife, who was half Umber half lysene (her mother was secretly impregnated by Moredea as well, so that's where our siblingship comes from), and I impregnated HER secretly with Moredea again (even though Moredea's been dead a long time she can still impregnate people with the pollinate command), so my son is a secret bastard and that crazy mix I mentioned above without a hint of Targ blood in there. I named him Moredeon as well, because even my own characters are too stupid to understand irony.

This, of course, is probably the MOST stable line I have. My master of laws is a quarter-dragon quarter high-valyrian half Summer islander lesbian Targaryen. Rhaeynra's brothers and sisters had their own lines which spiralled out of control when I pollinated them with random characters across the globe and I gave their progeny all kinds of lordships. All sorts of different cultures and religions. I have an Ironborn woman holding dothraki lands and she is of the Many-Faced God culture because she's a bastard of one of the Faceless Men.

My Lord Paramounts are pretty much relegated to one county now because I figured out the easiest way to control everyone was pretty much stick the lord paramounts in some tiny useless piece of land and have me rule over everything else as single counties directly, destroying all kingdom titles across Essos. That being said, the Tullys, Starks, Lannisters, Arryns, Tyrells are all still alive. (because I've forced their marriages and children with all sorts of weird cultures and stuff) I believe a Velyaron has taken over the Dorne paramouncy. Hell, I ressurected the Gardeners, Durrendons, Fishers, Teagues, Strongs, and Hoares by impregnating random courtiers with dead house members and gave THOSE bastards one county land and accepting their request to be legitimized. (I legitimize ANYONE who asks whether they're my family or another family. No exceptions. You want to be one of my thousand family members, no problem!). I have two Targ bastards who are actually the children of the Grey King! 

I don't just control the babies these people have, I control who they marry and try to have them yearly spit out babies with the pollinate command to make sure each lord has at least 8 children.

Aegon the Conqueror sired quite a few bastards. My favorite is a fatass high valyrian bastard who never requested legitimacy Aegon had with a fat Jogos Nghai girl. He was lovely. I gave him Longtable. :D

I have several lords who are directly descended from dragons. Just change their culture and religion and they can breed just like everyone else and hold land! One is a legitimized full dragon (child of Syrax and a random UNKNOWN dragon), and two are half-dragon, half-ruin (Silverwing and Vhagar I believe are the mothers). The lucky ruin that got to do the nasty with them was the Ruin of Basilisk Point (took a LOT of tries).

I have bastards who are literally the children of themselves. If a female pollinates herself her children she'll have a girl or boy with her identical character ID (and if a girl, will have the SAME face--probably different hair though).

I'm having a lot of fun integrating the Qartheen into everyone. I have a TON of Qartheen bastards (many of whom are lords) across the world with Qartheen looks because it's so creepy (second in line is of course the children-of-the-corn lysene looks). Qartheen seem to have facial features similar to Stone Dornish so you always have a great chance of getting a fat balding chalk-white freak.

It is SO long to load the game and there's such lag because there's SO MANY FREAKING PEOPLE. But I'm playing this stupid game until the game completely shuts down, because that's what mad scientist breeding experiments are for. The end of the world...because the world refuses to load.

So that's about it for now. If anyone has any questions about what's going on in a certain part of the world or what I've discovered throughout this madness, feel free to ask.

338,384o8t,GoT: A Dream Of Wolves,"(Be gentle, first post on reddit, came here becamse i use this subbreddit for a lot of my ingame help) 

The bow string snapped and with it the white arrow flew striking the target in the throat, the target flew back from the force of the arrow. The young teen Faramir stood in the courtyard of ruined Oldstones with his bow at his side, looking down the good fifty metres to his fallen target. A wide smiled crossed his face and a sense of accomplishment ran through his very veins. ""He has a long way to go"" Came the voice of his father, Denathor Dunedain. ""He reminds me of you when you were his age"" was the reply from his older grand-father placing a hand on his son, his eyes still tracing his grand-sons form. The tree's blew gently in the wind, the ruins creaked around them, the sun shined down upon there long brown hair and the puddles under there feet seeped through there leather shoes. 

Young Faramir ran to his father, quick and with footing like a jaguar, but behind him, his brother Boromir was faster, more agile and slightly older, at the age of 17 he was a spitting image of his father and his father before him, he was the heir to the small mostly unknown house of Dunedain, a recently landed family given the ruins of Oldstones for their duty to House Stark during Roberts Rebellion. Trystan, Denathors father and the brothers grand-father fought side by side with Ned Starks father, Denathor fought beside Ned Stark and now Boromir, a squire to a Manderly. 

House Dunedain had for hundreds of years sent most of there sons to the wall, the first son saved from this tradition carried on the family, and so the family had always remained small, the girls married into other low families of The Vale, The Riverlands and The North. But this had changed with the formal rise to being Landed Nobles. Denathor was given the ruins of Oldstones, not much of a start of a great family but they  didn't need anything else, infact it was well known to Ned Stark and his close friends that Denathor requested the ruins. House Dunedain had lead a small force of Rangers. The Dunedain Rangers for many of years, although not a big force they trained in Ambushes, Archery and Foraging, there bows made from the famous Ironwood Trees and such became close friends with House Forrestor, which supplied them with weapons in return for food and other resources they gathered on there travels around the North, protecting the villages from Wildling Raids, joining the Nights Watch on some of their expeditions. 

The night gathers quickly and the camp was built over a space of 2 hours. The groups of friends could be seen where small groups of Rangers would form up there tents next to each other, most importantly you could see that Trystan, Denathor, Boromir and Faramir were in a central tent, they had no castlelan, they had no Spymaster or Maester, just the three of them with there semi-warm beef stew ""Well it tastes like Beef"" Faramir spoke up, the other three laughed and continued with the food, they spoke for half hour until Trystan turned to his son. ""I believe there's something you wish to say"" The tent went quiet, nothing was said for a second but it felt like minutes to Denathors children. ""Yes, yes of course."" He started, turning to his boys who had both looked at him with the same intrigue that there father gave him. ""We have betrothed you both"" There father said almost silently, Boromir was the first to pipe up and speak. ""The frey girl?"" Denathor turned to his older son and nodded ""It's a better match than we expected, she's his... 17th daughter or something like that, but in return we received free passage over the bridge for any command of 50 troops at any time."" Denathor smiled slightly, knowing that it wasn't the best return he had wanted, but he expected no less from there very unknown House. Denathor then turned to his younger son, Faramir. ""Talia Forrester"" Faramir looked up wide-eyed, He had met this girl once on there last expedition to Ironrath for their yearly supply of bows and arrows.  Faramir danced wildly in his head, she was his childhood love, well she was to him. She was a goddess to him. ""Oh.. And what did you get in return"" He said as courtly as he could, Trystan turned to his Grand-son. ""fifty more years of bows, you are to go to Ironrath and become Rodrik Forrestors ward."" Trystan informed him, Faramir didn't look concerned, it was well known that wardship felt much like being imprisoned, he had heard this much from Theon Greyjoy. Faramir had spared with Theon at the feast of Robert Winterfell, Jaime had laughed at them both and offered to fight both, until Tyrion Lannister came and distracted him, Tyrion seemed to take a great interest in the little dunedain, but it was a look that he didn't want to see again. He felt like a toy.

An owl landed outside the tent with a message, which Denathor took and read. ""Lord Paramount Eddard Stark has been arrested"" was all that everyone really heard from Denathor's reading of the small scroll, Denathor looked to his two sons and his father and headed for the outside of the tent. ""Grab your gear and get ready to ride."" Denathor ordered, his father grabbed his arm. ""We are Rangers, we do not have to do anything, we just protect the local farmers."" Trystan advised, but his hand was pushed from his sons shoulder. ""Eddard made us the men we are today, we ride to Winterfell tonight, this cannot wait."" Denathor retaliated, his hand already grabbing the reins of the horse and mounting it within moments. Faramir and his brother readied themselves and the party of Rangers headed to Winterfell, a cold and slow journey but they arrived at Winterfell before sunset. 

The family entered the halls of winterfell, Robb Stark introduced himself to them and they sat for food. ""Any friend of my fathers is always welcome at Winterfell"" Was Robb's words, they sat for hours talking until the subject of there father really approached any meaning, Robb Stark was young and wanting a fight, he drew his sword and held it infront of him. ""I say we march and take back our Father, as my father had done before."" Robb Stark proudly called out, Theon Greyjoy joined in the small rally, but there castelan had calmed them down and Catelyn had calmed her son Robb. ""We need to get my father back, we need to bring him home, we cannot let this boy-king bite the head of the wolf!"" Robb nearly angry at this point. ""We will go."" Denathor nearly whispered, his father taking his arm again ""I advise agai-"" he started, but he was cut off by Boromir. ""We'll sneak in, bring you're father back, we are Rangers and used to hiding, we can slip in un-noticed and get him out."" Denathor turned to his son and nodded with respect, he then turned to Faramir and put his hand on his head ""Stay with Robb Stark until we bring back his father, he is a good man."" Robb thought for a moment and then nodded to the Rangers. ""You must not be caught, wear nothing that would relate you to House Dunedain or to do with the North and her allies. ""

It didn't take long for 30 man company to get to Kings Landing, much less than you would expect, but they knew how to travel fast, taking boats where preferable and riding hard using multiple horses on the way. Sneaking in was easy for these men, used to scaling the mountains in the night. They waited for the night to finish, each ranger sleeping in the streets or taverns, even brothels according to how much money they had lining there pockets, which wasn't ever much. They slept in waiting for Ned Stark to be brought to the Sept of Baelor to await trial. There arrows sharp and there swords close to hand. They would easily take Ned Stark away before he got to the sept, they would 'random' Ned Stark back to the Starks and deal with the fall out afterwards.

The snow dropped to the floor, settling on the grass and leaves on the floor. A young wolf ran through, black crows rotating around the small young direwolf. Golden Cloaked Lions surrounding them more, attacking in unison. A shadow of a man in a cage staring at the young wolf. The lions surround the Crows and kill them one by one, the lions approach the young wolf and take it. In the distance a black-charred castle where they were all headed too. Screams and shouts could be heard. Faramir jumped up, sweating all over and staring at the stone wall before him, the straw sticking to his body and the clothes around him spread across the floor, Faramir must have thrown them all off. ""What...was that."" He said to himself, quickly writing down the dream and attaching it to his Owl. His father needed to hear of this, this must have been something important. ""With haste"" He told the owl, which knew where he was headed. The owl flew to Kings Landing.

Boromir was in place, ready to swing down and strike at the guards bringing Eddard Stark to the Sept, Denathor was in the crowd with the rest of the men, dressed in rags ready to join if needed. Trystan was far off with his bow and arrows, aimed at the king. The plan was simple. Boromir would strike at the group with Eddard Stark and pull him through the crowds. Denathor and his men in the crowds would ready themselves in the crowds ambushing the Gold Cloaks as they get through the crowd, Trystan would take a few failed shots at King Joffrey to force most of the soldiers to retreat with the king. The plan was not to kill Joffrey, but to assist with the escape. Boromir was ready with the rope, he drew his bow and readied a shot but it was already to late, someone had spotted him and pointed out to the nearest guard, the Gold cloaks were atop the building behind him, Eddard Stark already on the sept. Denathor's panicked face could be seen from the high tower that his father was hiding in with his bow and arrow, it was too late for this plan, they would all sit and watch as Eddard Stark was thrown down, his head on the block. Denathor and Trystan swore to themselves under there breath, wanting to jump forward and fight, but it would mean the death of all of them and possible war. 

An owl flew down, landing on the ledge before Trystan, who quickly read the writing. Golden Lions, Young Wolves, Crows?"" He asked himself, knowing it wasn't the time for this he looked up to watch as the blade came crashing down on Eddards head, striking it from his body. A small detachment of gold cloaks pulled a young man to the sept, Boromir was thrown to the chopping block ""Ah, a Ranger from the North apparently!"" Joffrey called out, Sansa in all her crying recognised the young man ""Boromir??"" She nearly called out, the Gold Cloaks had already taken Boromirs hands, both of them. ""He didn't last long hiding his identity when we took his right hand!"" The gold cloaks boasted. ""Hear to save your honourable Eddard Stark are we, House Dunedain, I have never even heard of you. But I will wipe out every member of your family for this treason!"" The boy-king exclaimed, laughing as the young man bled over the sept, crying in pain. He had looked up to see his father, jumping up from the crowd with his word drawn. ""BOROMIIIIR!"" He shouted, the Rangers in unison attacked forward, time went quick and slow at the same time, ""Kill them all! TAKE ALL THERE HEADS"" Shouted Joffrey, who had already began retreating, not knowing the numbers he was facing. Trystan would get revenge, he pulled his bow up and began to aim it at Joffrey, ""Young Wolf..."" echoed through his head, ""Crow"" shouted louder afterwards, his eyes widened, he could see Yoren, recognizing him from there numerous missions with the Nights Watch. He knew what he had to do, he watched as the gold cloaks approached the Crow, one recognizing Arya Stark from when she approached him and his friend at the gate of Kings Landing, they refused her entry not days before. ""That's her, get her!"" They shouted.  The crowds had left and Yoren engaged two of the Gold cloaks, the others started to surround him. ""Crows and Wolves, Golden Lions.""

A knife touched Trystans throat. ""A man is not the only one tracking the young wolf."" a strange voice spoke, Trystan saw only the shadow left on the ledge infront of him, the shadow of a man. ""I'm not here for her!"" Trystan exclaimed quickly, the man turned him around and stared him in the eyes. ""Then let us go."" The man said again, the two of them leaving the tower and heading to the bottom of the tower. Denathor held Boromir in his arms, Boromir had died from his wounds, laying at the bottom of the sept with Eddard Starks body. ""Son, SON WE MUST GO. We can still save Arya Stark"" Trystan commanded, throwing the letter before his eyes, the shadow man read also ""I have had the same vision... but of a different purpose.""

The trio headed in the direction Yoren, Arya and the Gold Cloaks had escaped and assisted there escape, they knew they had to kill the Gold Cloaks that had seen Arya. ""If they believe she died, there wont be any trouble on your way to the wall Yoren."" But this conversation was short lived, as they engaged in a fight with Gold Cloaks, ""Run, RUN!"" Trystan shouted at them, Yoren, Arya and Denathor, Trystan fighting the following Gold Cloaks, cutting them all down with the assistance of the Shadow man. The fighting was over for the both of them, but they heard  the shouts of mounted soldiers catching up quickly to the fleeing party, the duo ran as fast as they could. ""Just who are you?"" Trystan asked, dodging people as they ran through the crowd. ""A man is Jaqen H'ghar."" he replied as they ran. It took awhile to catch up with there companions but when they did, they noticed that the three of them were already disarmed, Arya Stark to be the only one spared that was clear, Trystan watched, shaking in his boots. ""We can't save them.."" Trystan gave up, his sword hand dropping. ""I can save them, for a price."" Jaqen answered, looking to the old man. ""What? A price? I have no gold!"" Trystan nearly shouted, trying not to gain much attention ""Your life..."" Jaqen replied with his normal unmoving face. ""Your... from the House of Black and White."" and with that Jaqen looked confused, ""You know of this... Just as I had seen.""

In my other saved game, I managed to depose King Joffrey and install House Rosby as King of the Iron Throne with the help of the Iron Bank event (they approached House Rosby because Joffrey was bankrupt). You can get powerful by simply controlling the Crownlands, King's Landing is under your mercy.

354,3al7gf,Current Game so far.,"The year was 8299, Westeros was at war once again. Controversy over the boy King Jofferys parentage had led to Lord Stannis declaring his claim on the Iron Throne, while in the North the newly crowned King Robb Stark was mustering his forces in a bid to declare his independence from the corrupt Iron Throne, as well as enact vengeance upon anyone with golden hair and green eyes.

But the real important news did not come from Westeros, but from the Stepstones, more specifically Bloodstone, for it's lord was none other than Lord Laenor Targaryen, brother of Aerys the Mad King and Uncle of the Mother of Dragons.

Lord Laenor Targaryen had been exiled from Westeros many years ago when the Mad King had overheard him warn Prince Rhaegar against pursuing Lady Lynna Stark and in a fit of paranoia had exiled his younger Brother, who had crossed the Dothraki plains and disappeared, thought dead. Until 8299, that is.

Lord Laenor had known all about his families overthrow during the war of the usurper, he had even predicted it, knowing Rhaegar would not stop in his pursuit of Lady Stark. But he was enraged by Lord Eddard Starks letter to him telling of how his niece and nephew were murdered in the Red Keep, along with Lady Martell. 'The Wandering Dragon' as he would come to be known as for his constant travelling, never staying in one place more than once, was a good friend to Lord Stark; although not as close as Lord Stark and the Usurper. They would keep in contact for many years, although in secret so the Usurper wouldn't find out and track Laenor down.

But as much he burned with hatred for the Baretheons, and later the Lannisters, he was just one man, without a army or even a title to his name. So he would spend nearly two decades wandering as far as Asshai and Sothoryos, long silver beard growing longer as the years passed, until he looked like nothing more than a begger.

But he was no begger, he was the blood of the Dragon. 

He finally started to head west again, with no goal in mind but to simply see the flowing blue rivers of the Riverlands, to bite into the sweet apples of the Reach, and to just take in the sights, smells, and sounds of his birthplace. He was no King, he did not want to rule a Kingdom, even if it meant revenge.

But all that changed when in 8299, having just acquired a small island in the Stepstones called bloodstone and resigned himself to a life of peace and quiet (he had already visited Westeros but decided he better not overstay his welcome) he got a letter from an old friend from Qarth, it seemed that his niece Daenerys Targaryen had hatched three dragons, the first in more than 150 years, and a plan began to form in his head.

Laenor first sent word to Dany, revealing that he was alive. She begged him to join her in Slaver's bay, where she had begun a campaign to liberate the Slaver Cities, but he refused, stating that he did not have the men or resources to help her, but if her campaign failed she could find safety in his court. Laenor knew that Daenerys was still grief stricken over Khal Drogo's death, but once she got over that he planned to marry her, and with her Dragons he would take back Westeros, not for power or glory but to bring peace to the war torn land and maybe then and then alone could he die peacefully.

He still dreamed that he was never exiled from Westeros and the war never came to be. If he had been in the Red Keep when Lord Stark and his Son rode to the capital demanding Rhaegar show himself, perhaps things would have gone differently. So part of him wanted to lay rest to the ghosts of his past, as well as bring peace.

Over the next few years Lord Laenor built up his power in the Stepstones, and it was mid 8303 when he received word that his niece had been captured in battle by the Good Master of Meereen, ending her wars in Slavers Bay. Laenor immediately broke her out of prison and smuggled her to Bloodstone, where she married him and gave him Rhaegal, her second strongest dragon who he tamed instantly.

At this point Lord Stannis Baretheon had lost his war to Joffery, as well as his head, which was lopped off by Jaime Lannister (who had managed to escape from King Robb's prison). But before Lord Stannis' head hit the ground, as Laenor's spies later told him, King Robb Stark marched into Kings Landing and did the same to the boy King and his escaped prisoner, as well as every Lannister he could lay his hands upon. This changed Lord Laenor's plans drastically, for soon after these events took place, a faction rose in rebellion to place Laenor on the Throne. It appeared that the only Lannister who was captured by Robb Stark and spared was none other than Myrcella Lannister, some say he spared her out mercy, others said love, but whatever the case news had spread of Lord Laenors survival and the people decided that they wanted the Wandering Dragon on the throne instead of an inbred girl.

She, or more likely the Regent Petr Littlefinger, refused, and war broke out. It would last only half a year, and by the end of it Kings Landing was nothing more than a smoking ruin, corpses piled high in the streets from desperate and bloody fighting. Amoung the dead several Kingsguard members, including Sandor the Hound, brother of the man who killed Laenor's young nephew and niece all those years ago. His death was at the hands of Oberyn Martell as well, Doran Martell would always be grateful to Laenor for allowing his forces to lead the assault on Kings Landing after this.

So, on September the 17th, 8304, Laenor was crowned King of the Rhoyner, Andals, and First Men, and Protector of the Realm.",1,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/3al7gf/current_game_so_far/,2015-06-21 11:53:03

Who is there to hopefully conqueror either the Iron Throne or any Chosen Title i can target it with (Most Likely One of the Step-stones or One of the Iron Isles or Harrenhal) What i need help with is creating the event that successfully creates this landless courtier who is then made a blackfyre and depending on the start date or just creating multiple event that have set ages to help match canon (For example at ACOK having the Blackfyre Aged Realistically to be Maelys the Monstrous's Son/Daughter, I hope that there is a featurette of code to make the courtier aged correctly or i can create multiple versions that have set age spans to help fit the Age Timing(like during 8300 it cant be the 16 year old son/daughter Maelys who died 260AC (8260) I need to be within the 40-50 Region of Age) I hope I'm not asking for too much But I'm Just asking for this because simply: Why go through the trouble of creating characters with the Designer and then using the CC to create all of this when i can spend a few days creating an event that does it all in one fell swoop and hopefully avoided issues.

357,1m48bc,Hey guys I finally did it.,"I started as Tywin Lannister in the Clash of Kings scenario and my personal gole was to become king not to be relevant of the king. To be the king as tywin. So first of all I crushed Robb Stark in the Riverlands and then defeated Stannis in the Big Battle of Storms End. It was like 34000 Lannisters vs 28000 Baratheons. Meanwhile Aegon Targaryen landed in Kingslanding and killed Joffrey in personal combat. He got king and also killed Tommen. He gave the Stormlands (or better the rest of this destroyed everything) to Jon Conningten. Ofc I founded the Myrcella for the Iron Throne fraction and pressed the claim. Ofc Aegon declined and called for war. I gave him this war. I and the Tyrells (we arent Allies but somehow they really like me even after i defeated them in the war against the North (they declared for Robb). So Lannister and Tyrells fought together vs Aegon, The splitters of the Stormlands (without Tarth, they declared for me)  and Dorn and the Vale. Well it was quite easy i took like 600000 man in 3 armys and sieged kings landing rushing it. I captured aegon exuted him and crowned Mycella queen. At the same moment I started a plot with my son Tyrion to kill her. He was Hand of the King and Cupbearer. He poisend her. So now im the King i gave the Stormlands to Kevan and the Westerlands to Tyrion. So now I will start the war vs the rest of the North and the Iron Islands( NORTH and riverlands are vassals of the Iron Islands xD) wish me luck. 
And some funny facts: Loras Tyrell got slained by Gregor Clegane and Robb Stark died in personal combat vs Asha Greyjoy xD
HEAR ME ROAR

Edit: Ok now Lancel inhabit the Stormlands from Kevan but has no son. I also defeated the Greyjoy in the war for the riverlands. Now i have to wait until i start next war. 

I gave the Riverlands too Rymann Frey :).
Also Danearys Targaryen came to my court (i married her to one of the sons of Kevan) and now she is my master of arms means that I have dragons to defend my kingdom vs the Ironborn xD.

Edit 2: ok now i died at age of 75 and tyrion inhabit all. But the big problem is that now i have no real person to rule the westerlands. So i gave it to lancel little brother whillem. Some days later Lancel of the Stormlands declared war for the Westerlands... I also crushed the greyjoys again and i have now all Riverlanders under my controll (Freys are so easy to controll). 
Also Robert Arryn died and his great cosouin hired it but he also died and know the Arryns are gone and Hardying inhabit it...
The North trys to break free Ryswells,Flints,Manderleys,Boltons,Karstarks,and Reeds are fighting vs the Iron Islands for indepandance and to become my vassals again. (well not really but i will make them to my vassals=

I've been trying to drop ~~the hottest mixtape of 2015~~ a new AAR for quite some time, but **THIS SHIT MOD KEEPS CRASHING.**  I also really haven't had time to do too many playthroughs, so the crashes basically erased all of my game time. Even reloading autosaves doesn't buy me enough time before the game re-crashes. **I suspect that it's all because God's mad at me for calling him a dick.**

Highlights from my aborted **Tywin Lannister** runthrough include killing **Yohn Royce** in single combat as **Tywin** and killing **Fashbinder** (who was holding **Brightroar**) with **Tyrion**. Also, after the war ended- CAN MY **HOUSEMATE** BE **FUCKING** HIS **GIRLFRIEND** ANY **LOUDER**?

Anyway, I've decided that we're taking a break from established characters, and I'm going to do a customized character runthrough.

This of course, on the condition that I don't have to roleplay because **I'm not a fucking nerd.**

So naturally, the character will be based on yours truly. 

Here's the traits in case you're curious or want to see if you can **out-tinker the tinkerer.**

*Ambitious*

*Authoritative*

*Brilliant Commander*

*Cynical*

*Deceitful*

*A Dog*

*Drunkard*

*Fashionable*

*Gregarious*

*Hedonist*

*Lunatic*

*Lustful*

*Proud*

*Rude*

*Ruthless*

*Slothful*

*Stubborn*

*Wroth* (no shit)

*+1 to Health*

*+1 to Fertility*

I've granted **you** the **power** to pick the bookmark and the person I'm replacing. Personally, I've been thinking about **AFFC Drakesgrave.** Don't suggest **republics,** primarily because they lack **conviction,** but also because **I don't own The Republic.** Comment now or **walk out the Moon Door.** It's no biggie. **TINKERGOD OUT.**

378,bqgt3u,5 INTRIGUANT CURIOSITIES ABOUT GAME OF THRONES YOU DID NOT KNOW,"1 -The ""horse-heart"" 
The horse-heart that Daenerys ate for Khal Drogo in the series was actually a 1.5 kg mass of a candy resembling the jelly-gum bullets.

2 - George RR Martin prefers sex to violence
The series contains many sex scenes and the author behind the novel of Game of Thrones made it clear to the press about his position when he was asked why there is so much sex scene in his books.  Martin soon replied, ""I can describe an ax entering a human skull in great explicit detail and no one will blink twice for it. I provide a similar, as detailed, description of a penis entering a vagina, and I receive letters  it's crazy.In the last analysis, in the history of the world, penises entering vaginas give a lot of people a lot of pleasure: axes that go into people's heads as well  , not so much. ""

3 - Dragons were inspired by geese and cats
To create the dragons, some curious inspirations had to have been made.  The dragons were inspired by geese and cats, exactly by the team having analyzed the way of life of the animals so that the personality of the flying giants was created.  According to effects supervisor Sven Martin of Pixomondo, the special effects company that created the versions for the three dragons Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion of Daenerys: ""We look at large animals like the goose when they are on the ground, as they  they play with their wings even though they can not fly. ""

4 - There are only three people who know the end of Game of Thrones
Fearing his death or something serious to happen and looking to the future and continuity of the series, George R.R. Martin revealed the end of his work acclaimed by the public for only two people.  In addition to him, the other two lucky guys who know the end of the story are his TV series producers, D. B. Weiss and David Benioff.  How lucky these guys are.

5 - 12 - Author George Martin writes books on a DOS computer
If you think that the author of the books that gave rise to the HBO saga currently writes your work in Word, Notepad, drive or any electronic writing device, forget it.  Martin develops his work in DOS operating system, a black background with white letters.  The author revealed that he writes the pages of the Chronicles of Ice and Fire on a computer running the operating system of the 1980s and 1990s, using WordStar 4.0 software.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/bqgt3u/5_intriguant_curiosities_about_game_of_thrones/,2019-05-19 17:13:30

388,46gc82,I think Dragon conquest is a bit overpowered,"I started a game as Aegon at the beginning of the conquest bookmark. I easily conquered all 7 Kingdoms. Some time later I conquered the Stepstones. Then Myr, Lys, Tyrosh, and Pentos before Aegon died of old age in his 70s. His heir Rhaegar continued in the conquest of Essos, and managed to conquer Braavos, Norvos, the Dothraki sea, Slaver's bay, Qarth, and a few small and insignificant rulers. This allowed me to create the Empire of New Valyria, and now I have two empires. Basically everything east of Yi Ti, aside from the ruins, on mainland Essos was under Targaryen rule. Rhaegar became known as the ""Conquerer"" as well, and again died of old age. On his death Rhaegar's daughter got the Empire of New Valyria, and my grandson (my heir through a grand council) got the Iron Throne. Once she died that empire passed onto her son, me. I then conquered Yi Ti, thus giving me control over 75% of the map, and I plan to finish my conquest. 


So basically within three generations I managed to conquer a continent and a half through dragon conquest. Totally not overpowered. /s",19,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/46gc82/i_think_dragon_conquest_is_a_bit_overpowered/,2016-02-18 22:01:25

We launched not too long ago, and are developing into a very strong community with a very interesting, player-driven plot!  We are looking for players to join in on the fun and help develop the plot!  So far, the realm is on the eve of war after the death of Queen Daenery's and disputes over who her heir should be.  A Grand Council is called to determine this, but nearly ends in bloodshed with no resolution.  In the aftermath, a King has arisen in the Iron Islands and another has risen and fallen in the Westerlands.  The North is on the brink of a civil war and the Reach and Stormlands are facing their own internal conflicts.  A full scale war could blow up at any time.  What happens next is up to the players but one thing is for certain;  When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die.  There is no middle ground.

There are plenty of characters and major houses available, so if you are interested please hop on over to our IRC and community sub to get acquainted and have any questions answered!

You can find us over at /r/IronThroneRP or /r/ITRPcommunity and at our [IRC Chatroom](http://irc.lc/darkmyst/IronThroneRP/IronThroneRP_@@@) Thanks everyone!

396,26slcs,it is going to take a while but I will try.,"So I chose a completely random county up in the north during the bleeding years. I started out as the Foresters of Wolfswood. I was under the Highlordship of Deepswoods. Fabricated claims in the tiniest counties just so I can raise up an army more than 200.... yeah 200. Anyway i gave my only daugther away to the Highlord of Brimswood and seriously without him I would have never won all of my 10 wars.

So What I am trying to do which I think you should all try, is to take everything without becoming the King of the North and leave them to their rightful rulers the Starks (let them keep Winterfell the county). I want to be able to control the North without controlling the North, if he fights back, I will depose him. The Starks can be your little puppet. This in turn will just be so crazy dealing with a gazillion vassals though but that is part of the challenge since I cant own more than 2 High Lordships.

I feel like having a king for a pet is more satisfying than killing them and taking over the throne. Also leave Bear Islands to the Mormonts...

I will add screen shots once I have more than 20 counties",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/26slcs/it_is_going_to_take_a_while_but_i_will_try/,2014-05-29 19:44:50

1.) Maegor the Cruel had a number of stillborn monstrosities.

2.) Prince Daemon had a stillborn monstrosity in both his daughter with Rhaenyra, and his bastard by Mysaria.

3.) King Viserys I had a stillborn child, Baelon (though he admittedly did end up having 5 other healthy children).

4.) King Aerys II (i.e. Mad Aerys) was inbred and wed to his sister, and had some ~5 miscarriages/weak/frail children that died within a year of birth.

These characters all share the trait of being extremely inbred.

What I find interesting, however, is that after Daeron II, and before Jaehaerys II, there is ~50 year period with only 2 stillbirths (Prince Valarr and Kiera of Tyrosh's kids).",14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/ar48se/do_inbred_characters_have_a_higher_chance_of/,2019-02-16 05:23:16

425,7i2fyv,Kingdom Titles lost on start,"I put up a post concerning this before. Every time I start up a new game every Kingdom Title in the game disappears. For example, with ACOK, Joffery has the LP of the Crownlands instead of the Iron Throne and Robb loses KITN and the North is separated into High Lordships. I thought it was because I was running 1.4.1 and installed 1.5 with no change.

 I then uninstalled everything related to the mod and reinstalled it. Nothing changed with 1.5, so I uninstalled 1.5, updated to 2.8.1 and, got 1.6 with no change to the loss of Kingdom titles.

I check 1.4.1, 1.5, and 1.6 with and without submods to see if they were responsible, but that wasn't the answer. I even checked the base game, but the Kingdom titles were there.

I honestly don't know what to do next. I absolutely love this mod and want to play it again. My last course of action is to uninstall CK2 as a whole to see if that works.",8,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/7i2fyv/kingdom_titles_lost_on_start/,2017-12-07 03:12:46

438,4h1e07,Are wars supposed to be this easy?,"I've recently tried the following bookmarks:

* War of Conquest (as Aegon)
* Robert's Rebellion (as Robert)
* Blackfyre Rebellion (as Daemon Blackfyre)
* A Clash of Kings (as Robb Stark)

In every one, the war has been easy. I expect the War of Conquest is supposed to be easy, but here's how the others went:

* Robert's Rebellion: Gathered my levies and those of my vassals together, easily won a few skirmishes, parked my army on King's Landing, won the siege, captured Aerys, the end.

* Blackfyre Rebellion: Army already started as a single stack. Immediately parked it on King's Landing, somehow failed to capture Daeron despite winning all the sieges (even after capturing the Red Keep, it still said he was 'reigning in the Red Keep'), but still got to a > 90% war score just from the sieges and from the few times an army tried in vain to attack mine. After that winning was just a matter of picking a nearby province at random to siege until my warscore reached 100%.

* A Clash of Kings: Again, army starts as a single stack. Parked it on Harrenhal until I triggered Arya's return, then parked it on King's Landing until Joffrey was captured, giving me a 100% war score.

Every time it's the same. The AI wanders around pointlessly sieging useless provinces for little gain whilst I immediately go for the big targets and easily win. The few times they do come into direct conflict with my army, they fail to combine enough of their own armies first, and so long as I appropriately assign high marshal generals to my army I win against even somewhat larger forces without significant losses.

1.1.2 is the only version I've played in earnest, so I don't know if this is specific to this version, and I've never played vanilla CK2 except for one playthrough of the tutorial, so I don't know if this affects vanilla.

452,4vr922,Just an idea for a new starting Scenario.,"So in the long time that I've been playing this mod it's come to my attention that I seem to have done most of what is to do in the current given starting dates, of course everyone can always come up with some new goal but I thought, maybe a new starting date would be a nice addition.




I actually have a few suggestions and want to know what the rest of the community thinks. Personally, I'd be very interested to play three specific times in Westeros history. The first being the coming of the first men, it could be something like Aegon's conquest, only it's the king of the first men invading and Westeros is populated by the children.




The second idea would be for the Long Night, to have the walkers come down south and have to be pushed back to the lands of always winter, either playing as the night's king or the westerosi trying to fight back against him and his walkers.




Lastly I would like to see the Andal Invasion, where Andalos (Which I believe is made up of Pentos and the southern part of Braavos.) declares war on the different sections of Westeros and invade from Essos across the narrow sea.

474,3i489e,"Repeated ""Upset By Succession Law Change"" From Vassals","Hey, I am new to this mod and just started playing it. I am playing in the Bleeding Years starting point as the Starks. I had to change my game back to 2.3.6. My son married the daughter of the Stormlands and she became Queen there. Shortly after my vassals all rebelled trying to depose me because they were upset over succession law change. I haven't changed any succession laws. Due to the timing I don't think it has anything to do with the marriage. I put down the rebellion but all my vassals still hate me as the penalty continues to apply over and over. Most of them have a -600 penalty. Additionally, it will sometimes prevent me from changing succession laws even though I haven't touched them.

Is it just a compatibility issue between 2.3.4 (The Mod) and the 2.3.6 (The closest version steam will allow me to get to)? Or is it a hardwired thing in the game?",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/3i489e/repeated_upset_by_succession_law_change_from/,2015-08-24 00:29:21
