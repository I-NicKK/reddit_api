2,e5kc21,How do I change Aegon's dynasty?,"Hey there. In my current playthrough I started at the War of the five Kings bookmark. After a while, Aegon of Essos invaded and fought against Joffrey. Somehow he lost that war. Now a few years later, Joffrey lost a rebellion and a great council was called to determine his successor. Aegon won that council and now is the king.
However, his dynasty still is ""of Essos"". Is there a way for me to change it to Targaryen? It just feels weird to me, to have the Iron Throne ruled by the ""of Essos"" house.",3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e5kc21/how_do_i_change_aegons_dynasty/,2019-12-03 20:22:59

But is there any way to have the campaign play out more closely to the original story?

First I started a game as House Mallister during Roberts Rebellion and somehow managed to slay Walder Frey right in the beginning. The Rebellion itself ended with Benjen Stark becoming Lord of Winterfell after Neds death and so preventing the Stark children from ever existing.

Then I played as House Velaryon after Aegons Conquest. Aegon died childless, which led to a Martell becoming King of Westeros and the extinction of House Targaryan.


So is there anything I can do to prevent a total different outcome of the story while playing minor houses?",3,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e5658b/is_there_any_way_to_have_the_outcome_of_the/,2019-12-03 00:47:38

30,e3xg0q,My biggest wish to keep the game interesting,"Hi all!  

I have too many hours to count on this game and have tried out all starting dates with different characters. I love playing as historical characters and to play the gane of thrones. Recently however, my playthroughs havent been too great. I keep trying to find interesting characters but there is always one limiting factor: The inabillity to start a game without automatically generated wives and children. Now this option does exist in vanilla ck2 but somehow its not possible on agot. Don't get me wrong, all historical characters featuring in stories should be there, however there are loads of ""unknown"" characters where one starts with an insignificant count but he already has 3 children. This effectively slows you down a generation in getting the right claims through marriage. Also, due to the maester mechanics, you dont want to start out the game with 3 children because they are mostly in the same age range and share the maester benefits instead of just your heir. Please, if an update is made, include this option so that im not left with a wasted generation.",2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e3xg0q/my_biggest_wish_to_keep_the_game_interesting/,2019-11-30 17:49:58

I like the idea of more control over education, and adding some flavour with societies and such. YouTubers just seem to be playing a much more fleshed out experience (I've been watching Roll 1d2's epic campaigns). 

So far I'm looking at getting:

- Way of Life
- The Republic
- Conclave

And have been lightly considering Old Gods, Reapers Due, maybe Holy Fury if it's worth it. I'm still not convinced about Conclave, while I think I'd enjoy the favour system, and some have said it is good with the GoT mod, I don't like the idea of my council having to approve everything.

So,

Is Conclave worth it?

How about Reapers Due? Do I really want to spend money just do my character can get sick?

Is Holy Fury a hard pass?

56,e2mab0,Pretty bad late game lag.,"I know CK2 has some pretty bad optimization and that the mod will naturally have such issues but I built a new pc and spent a decent bit on a CPU to get a good one so these kinds of things wouldn't be an issue. I went from an old i5 4460 to a Ryzen 7 3700x which is about a 57% increase in single core processing power... and late game still has nasty lag. The first of every month the game freezes for 5 seconds and lags and the third speed... is this just a lack of optimization or a case of a game not running well with AMD? Or maybe my CPU is garbage or defective? Is late game lag normal even on a strong gaming pc?

Every game runs at 60FPS (probably a lot more but I dont really care to have a counter), it's a shame that my absolute favourite game and mod run pretty poorly still. I likely would have skimped out on parts and gotten a mid tier pc if I'd know this was still going to be an issue.",3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e2mab0/pretty_bad_late_game_lag/,2019-11-27 23:32:22

I’m thinking of playing them with a similar agenda to the one that has been posited in the theories that say they have been working towards undermining Targs/ killing off dragons.

If dragons are still around in the bookmark I play in, I’m thinking of allowing myself to kill off a dragon every 5 years or so as long as I meet a certain criteria. 

So far I’m thinking my criteria should be that I have 300-500 gold (depending on the age of the dragon) that I will “spend”, and that I need to have a higher intrigue score than both the current King (if a Targ or dragon rider) and a higher intrigue score than the rider of the dragon I kill.  Any other criteria you think would be fair/fitting for the agenda? I’m thinking of maybe adding in some kind of dice roll mechanic so even if I do match the criteria it only has a 10% chance or so of working.

90,e0weaq,"Dragonseeds, anyone?","After a bit of a hiatus, I've been diving back into the mod this past week.  As is often the case, I typically spend a day or two hunting through ASOIAF lore looking for inspiration and unique playthrough possibilities.  I personally enjoy starts that are *mostly* lore adherent, but perhaps have a twist or two that isn't too much of a logical stretch.  I think it's fun to play minor characters that are tied to the larger ones we know, as this allows one to be both a spectator and participant at will in the Game of Thrones.  

Like most of us, I've played through Dance of Dragons and the surrounding bookmarks countless times as a myriad of characters.  However, I didn't really consider the Dragonseeds as anything other than dragon warfare fodder until now.  With a bit of setting up, landing one or more of these characters from the start can really offer some fresh, open play options akin to Daemon's Rogue Prince run.

[Hugh Hammer](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hugh_Hammer) - Arguably the most ambitious of the Dragonseeds, this burly blacksmith managed the feat of taming the late King Jaehaerys' own dragon, Vermithor The Bronze Fury.  Riding one of the strongest dragons in existence, Hugh is an army of one.  Lore-wise, he would attempt to crown himself king at one point, so it's not much of a stretch to accelerate his ambitions for our purposes. Shortly after taming Vermithor, let's imagine Hugh flees to the Stepstones.  Give him one of the islands and let the ""right of might"" rule.  Give Hugh the crown he desires by conquering the other pitiful islands and declaring the Kingdom of the Stepstones.  You can play either side of the Dance, or shun politics altogether and pillage as a pirate instead (or both!).  As a bonus, he has a pretty kickass sigil for House Hammer.

[Ulf The White](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ulf_White) - Ulf isn't very fleshed out in the lore, mostly being a parallel to Hugh as a dragonrider who wants more than he has been given.  But, he too has a cool sigil, so it's fun to pick a plot for him.  Since he's ""White"" at least in name, perhaps Ulf tries a more traditional route to power.  Give him a speck of land somewhere in the Reach, with ultimate designs on the kingdom itself (in lore, he desired Highgarden instead of the prize of Bitterbrige he received).  He may be an up-jumped nobody, but on the back of Silverwing even the most fabled houses of the Reach must pay him some degree of respect.  Again, you can play whichever side of the Dance (and inevitable following conflicts) as you wish, all while working the inter-machinations of alliances and marriages within the Reach itself.  Don't rest until Highgarden is yours. 

[Nettles](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nettles) - This is my current and longest playthrough of the Dragonseeds thus far.  It is also the most fun I've had with this game in a long time!  Nettles is an *even more* obscure character, with no notable family or lineage to speak of-- she doesn't even have her own sigil.  But what she doesn't have in credentials, she makes up for in pure guile and ambition.  She managed to tame one of the wildest dragons in existence, Sheepstealer, with a ploy that would impress Lann the Clever.  Let's take her ingenious nature a step further and give her one of the four counties of The Sisters.  I chose Sunderland because the family seems to be the newer, dominant Andal presence on the island, while the other three appear to harken more to the days of the First Men.  Nettles quickly picks up on the ancient Sisterman lore and starts a thorough propaganda campaign of independence, claiming herself to be the Lady of the Waves reborn.  After an exciting war against Lady Jeyne of the Vale, it's easy enough to conquer another high lordship to form the Kingdom of The Sisters and reclaim the Old Ways of the small islands.  By this time, the Dance has likely shaken out between the Targs and you can swear fealty directly to the Iron Throne or gain an alliance like I did (Rhaenyra had another male bastard, who I betrothed).  Alternatively, you can just try to stick it out on your own, as The Sisters are a fun challenge to defend in any war.  Being Lady of the Waves, you get some fun pirate antics here too.  Bonus:  you've got some juicy soap opera drama with Daemon Targaryen as your lover. 

As with any Dance playthrough, any of these options will leave you with plenty of follow up wars once the initial conflict is resolved. There are a lot of variables and should be plenty of action to go around for at least a generation or two.  I hope this can give a few of you some inspiration for starting your next game!",0,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e0weaq/dragonseeds_anyone/,2019-11-24 12:27:10

So backstory for my game. Started as Euron during the AFFC bookmark and beat the Reach easily. One of the provinces I got was the Arbor, which I gave to my eldest bastard, Quellon. I gave him Ryamsport (the city) first though, so he became a merchant republic and then I consoled my way into playing as him.

AI Euron went onto take Crakehall, Casterly Rock, and Seagard as well, giving the Ironborn most of Westeros' western shore. In the interim however, neither of us were helping the north and now, more or less everyone in Westeros is out of troops. The Iron Throne has 8k left after their most recent war with us. Dorne is down to 4k, Daenrys is dead, and Euron doesn't give a fuck. 

So my question is, when the war is over and the white walkers win, what will happen to the trade-posts I built in the reach. Those are basically all my trade-posts, so...

Also can the white walkers get to the Arbor? Or the Iron Islands?",8,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/e0sscm/if_the_white_walkers_win_what_happens_to_trade/,2019-11-24 06:04:28

220,dvfgkk,My guide to get the best out of Chronicles (in the mod),"So if you are like me and you are a big fan of the concept of Chronicles (from Charlemagne dlc) and you, like me, give it importance whilst playing the game then I am happy to announce that I have finally cracked the code.
The main problem that people encounter with chronicles in the mod is how it stops working for a long number of in-game years and then starts working again only to eventually stop working once more.

So the first thing that I noticed in the base game is how when nothing much happens the game creates random events like “peasants spotted blood raining in such and such province” or “a dragon has been spotted in such and such province” etc things that in general have nothing to do with the game, so I realized that they were put there on purpose in order for Chronicles to continue. So I came to the correct conclusion that if nothing happens during an in game year then Chronicles gets cut off and stops working. The weird thing is these random events that have been programmed in order for Chronicles to continue do not show up in the Game of Thrones mod (weirdly enough they do in the Witcher). 
Hence I figured out that in order for chronicles to continue and not cut off one has to create an event in the game or do certain things that will be recorded yearly. 
So one has to make sure that an event is recorded each year, however not all events are recorded so I have made a list of things that do get recorded, I may have missed some things out but these are the main things, some of them can be even acquired using the Console command.

Here goes: 

-Marriage 

-Birth

-Death (of yourself or family)

-War declarations

-Mercenaries leave due to lack of payment

-Revolts (through imprisonments)

-Religious conversions

-Get nickname 

-Hold a grand tournament

-As king, appoint hand of king 

-Getting appointed to council

-Become regent 

-Battlefield victory 

-Battlefield duel 

-Colonise a ruin

-Fulfill exalted amongst men ambition 

-Purchase dragon egg: Event dragon.1

-Join faceless men: event faceless.10

-Get dragon 🐉 

-Tame dragon

-Attempt to hatch egg 

-Starting and ending blood feuds 

-Reform your religion 

-Switch to heir than switch back 

-Lover affair scandal comes to light 

-Dragons meet in battle 

And probably more.

221,dveat2,How to win the Throne as (fake) Aegon?,"Hello,

Just tried playing as (fake) Aegon in the AFFC start yesterday. At the third try I managed to conquer the Stormlands. However, I had absolutely no chance against the Iron Throne. The Westerlands and the Vale and like two dozen smaller lords would declare for the Throne, while only Dorne would declare for me. They outmatched us like 3-1 or 4-1, so there was literally no way to win the war.

Did anyone manage to win the Throne as Aegon? If yes, how? I would be very happy to hear about some tips and advice.

Rhaegar's Wiki Description: The beautiful Rhaegar had deep purple or indigo colored eyes. He had long, elegant fingers, and was taller than his younger brother, Viserys, would be in his adulthood. Rhaegar's hair was similar to the silver-blond of Viserys and their sister, Daenerys.

304,drt0un,**The Reign of the Dragons:** *A Genealogical tale of House Targaryen following the Conquest by Aegon Targaryen*,"**Book 1**

Every man, woman and child in Westeros knows of the conquest of Aegon Targaryen and his sisters, Visenya and Rhaenys.

Rightfully so, for Aegon and his sisters had forged a unified realm from the squabbling rivalries that had existed for millennia before. Yet it was the following years after the conquest that truly made the Seven Kingdoms into one unified land.

After the surrender of Torhen Stark and the North, Aegon and his sisters returned to the new town of King’s Landing, forging the Iron Throne of the blades of Aegon’s defeated enemies. Of the once independent realms in Westeros, only one now remained with unbent knees: Dorne.

It is said that many within Aegon’s court urged him to finish the conquest and take the last kingdom as he had all others. Visenya and Rhaenys encouraged him to do so as well, yet King Aegon was slow to move, an unlikely lethargy taking over as he instead chose to settle into his rule and allow peace to reign. Aegon, having won his kingdom, chose now to rule it for the first time, instead of waging another war in the blazing sands of Dorne.

In the year 1 A.C., the Queen Rhaenys announced to the court that she was pregnant with the king’s heir. All the court and realm waited in nervous anticipation as her belly grew, culminating with the birth of Aegon’s first child, a daughter named Maega. Alas, the child was born weak and ill formed and lived less than an hour before she took her last breath. King Aegon and Queen Rhaenys were devastated by the loss, though it is said that Queen Visenya did not share their feelings.

To make matters worse, many septons and septas, as well as others of the Faith, were quick to declare this to be divine justice from the gods to punish the incestuous relations that the Targaryens followed. Some fools were even seen to be celebrating in the streets upon the news. Alas, they would not celebrate for long.

When King Aegon heard of the condemnations of some of the faith, he rose in a black fury. Taking to the skies upon his dragon, Balerion the Black Dread, he rained fire down upon the unsuspecting guilty parties, destroying several septs that harbored priests who had dared to voice their joy at the terrible news. In the process, he nearly invoked a rebellion by the Faith Militant, who rose momentarily with their swords until a strict order from the High Septon brought them back to heel. The High Septon instead chose to go directly to King’s Landing, bringing healing oils and ointments for the queen and words of wisdom for the king. Under his careful words and actions, he reunited the realm that had threatened to fracture beyond recovery, whilst restoring sense and calm to the furious king.

In the weeks that followed, a new declaration came forth from King’s Landing. It was true that the princess had died, her small body already consigned to the fires of the Black Dread, but she had not died because of the incestuous relationship between Aegon and his sister. Rather, the High Septon proclaimed, it was because the gods had demanded her life as payment for the success of Aegon’s conquest. To win such a kingdom with the blessing of the gods, the gods had demanded a divine sacrifice and so the first child of the Conqueror had always been held in their hands. Now, the High Septon declared, the Princess Maega was being cared for in the presence of the gods, seated in the halls of the righteous where she would reign as a queen in the afterlife. Having appeased followers of the Faith, the High Septon then left King’s Landing a month later, his departure marked by a magnificent feast where King Aegon and his sisters reaffirmed their support for the Faith.  

And this was not all. During the feast, the Queen Rhaenys rose after King Aegon pledged to support his Holiness and declared that she was pregnant once again. The king would have an heir, she said, and this time the child would be male. As the court cheered and celebrated, there was only one who did not join the revelry, Queen Visenya. 

When the High Septon began on his journey back to Oldtown the next day, it was noticeably followed by several wagons filled to the brim with treasures, including a fabulous royal standard of House Targaryen with ruby dragons upon a black onyx background.

In the second month of 2 A.C., Queen Rhaenys gave birth again. This time, it was to a ruddy and robust boy named Aenys. Strong and filled with vigor, he was the embodiment of the king and grew up as the ideal heir to the Conqueror. Queen Rhaenys doted fiercely upon her son, spending almost every moment with her beloved child, while King Aegon showered his son with presents and toys. The realm rejoiced, none more perhaps than the High Septon, whose words had been vindicated and thereby strengthened. It is said that upon receiving news of Prince Aenys’ birth, the High Septon sent the child his own personal Seven Pointed Star, along with a vial of holy oil with which the prince was to be anointed. 

The excitement did not end here. A few months later, Queen Visenya declared that she was with child, proclaiming that she would also bear her husband a son and her nephew a brother. Celebrations rang out in the capital once more, though few with keen gazes saw that this was turning more into a rivalry between the sisters Visenya and Rhaenys rather than a joyous expansion of the ancient Valyrian house. 

In the second month of 3 A.C., almost a full year since the birth of Crown Prince Aenys, Queen Visenya gave birth to not a son but a daughter. Bright eyed, the girl was named Aella, and though Queen Visenya rejoiced, some said that a face of disappointment flew over her when she heard the goodwives declare the child a girl. But King Aegon did not care; he delighted in the birth of a healthy girl, seeing in her a queen to match Aenys as king. Ever after, the two children were placed in quarters together, even as babes.

Meanwhile, the realm began to forget the wars of conquest and grew, slowly more and more prosperous. King’s Landing slowly grew larger and greater, though nothing in comparison to the great cities of Lannisport and White Harbor, much less Oldtown. The king took part in his first royal tour during this time, a small one which took him to Duskendale, Claw Isle and Driftmark. There, he wined and dined with the lords while his sisters kept court at the capital.

In late 6 A.C., Queen Visenya gave birth once again, this time to the son she had so desperately desired. Yet the boy was dead before he left the womb and the halls of the Aegonfort were filled with the screams of the grieving mother who so desired a son. The boy was named Viserys and consigned to the fires of Vhagar and Balerion before joining his sister Maega in Dragonstone.

It is said that this drew a line between the sisters Rhaenys and Visenya, who rejected any attempts by Rhaenys to comfort her. This separation lasted for the better part of the next year and all noticed that neither sister would be in the same room as the other. It was not until Valaena Velaryon, mother the the siblings, came that they were reconciled.

The conquest of Dorne, meanwhile, remained a pressing thought in the minds of many. Some argued that with the future of the realm secured, now was the time to strike Dorne and join it to the fold. Foremost of the voices was Orys Baratheon, rumored bastard brother of the king and queens. With lands directly bordering the Martells, several minor skirmishes had erupted across the Dornish Marches and Orys was eager to bring the kingdom to heel.

Yet the Conqueror made no effort to invade Dorne. He ordered his lords to settle and take no hostile action against Dorne. Prince Nymor ruled in Dorne, having inherited the kingdom from his mother Meria, and he had wisely sent letters of friendship to the king. Aegon, busy keeping his kingdom stable and his children happy, decided to let Dorne remain independent.

In 12 A.C., Valaena Velaryon died at Dragonstone. The mother of the king and queens died, ostensibly of a heart attack, whilst tending to her grandchildren. Little Princess Aella had played a trick, according to the nurses, which proved a little too much for the aged dowager. Her body was consigned to the flames by Meraxes and interred next to her husband.

Two years later, Queen Visenya gave birth to her third child, another boy, strong and vigorous. Named Maegor, he was the apple of his mother’s eye, and beloved by his older siblings as well. Both royal children delighted in the babe, especially Aenys, whose acts of kindness and compassion to his younger brother did much to redeem him before Queen Visenya. Ever after, Prince Aenys found favor with his aunt Visenya, thereby doing much to rid the low simmering rivalry that had persisted between Rhaenys and Visenya for over a decade. Indeed, as Prince Maegor grew, his greatest teacher and defender was ever Prince Aenys, whilst in Maegor, Aenys found a lifelong supporter and devout follower.

Just months later, Queen Rhaenys also gave birth to a third child, a daughter named Daena. Now, both queens had given birth to three children and both had two living, a boy and a girl. As Aenys and Aella had been matched, King Aegon betrothed his two youngest children to one another. The realm celebrated the newest royal arrivals and, for perhaps the first time in many years, all of House Targaryen rejoiced earnestly with and among one another.

The matches, as it would later be seen, proved to be excellent decisions. Aenys and Aella doted on one another, whilst Maegor and Daena were devoted to each other as well. And while it is true that Maegor was said to have developed some of the madness that later embraced many of House Targaryen, Daena could drive his bouts of lunacy away like none other, not even Aenys or Aella. No rivalry developed among the children either, and Aenys and Aella were ever the guardians and protectors of their younger siblings. It is said that Crown Prince Aenys even went so far as to stand up to his imposing father when the king sought to punish Maegor one day for a minor mistake. 

The Seven Kingdoms prospered and House Targaryen grew like a brilliant oak tree.

Little more remains to be said about the reign of King Aegon but this. In the year 35 A.C., Queen Visenya died in King’s Landing at the age of 64. King Aegon and Queen Rhaenys were devastated by the loss of their sister and it is said that the stress from losing Visenya hastened the death of the Dragon when he passed away less than two years later in 37 A.C.

He was 64 years old upon his death and left behind his two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, of whom six were alive. The reign of the Dragon was over and the reign of the sons of the Dragon began.",1,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/drt0un/the_reign_of_the_dragons_a_genealogical_tale_of/,2019-11-05 05:53:14

I really wish that I could just keep playing as a High Lord, but I guess that's not an option. 

My father was actually the one elected, but after he died I became King. I guess I might have had the majority of votes? But I'm not sure. I wasn't really watching the votes when my father died. I currently have an infant son but he is not of age.
 
I'm not very versed with changing laws, but it looks like I cannot change succession laws in the North, because it inherits all its laws from the Iron Throne? Yet I still see the occasional faction asking for ""Primogeniture Succession in the North.""

Few questions:

* Any easy way out, maybe abdicate and just keep playing as a High Lord?
* Any way to change the succession laws? Either by encouraging factions in the North or changing the laws myself? Maybe I have to declare independence from the IT?
* Did I just not notice that I had the most votes when my father died?

361,dp432x,Reformed Valyrian,"So I reformed Valyrian, but what to pick?  Well some of it seems to be buggy.  I'm probably doing this to organize my thoughts on the matter, but I would love feedback and others' experiences.

Cosmopolitan or Peaceful? 

Cosmopolitan seems to be bugged or Peaceful or both are.  Cosmopolitan replaces ""Valyrian +5"" with ""Religious Tolerance +5"" not combine like you'd think.  Peaceful is basically Jainism and adds ""Liege is Naathi Religion +15"" in addition to changing ""Valyrian +5"" to ""Peaceful Religion +5"".  +20 to all vassals.

Cosmopolitan lets you marry into the Faith of the Seven and that's about it.  You can still marry Targaryens though.  Looting is disabled for Peaceful and I assume this means gold during sieges as if those were a thing.  Unless your goal is to put a Targaryen on every throne in Westeros, Peaceful seems to win here.  Maybe I'm missing something.

Valyrian Blood
Adds dark magic to the abilities you already know and love.  Just crazy OP, this is like 3.5 doctrines in one.

Faith of the Seven or Meritocracy
Faith of the Seven again seems bugged.  It replaces ""Peaceful Religion +5"" or ""Valyrian +5"" with ""Faith of the Seven +5"".  Other than that it lets you marry your Westerosi vassals (giving your niece money to go burn Casterly Rock is a lot of fun you should try it).  Plus you can still be a knight and hold tournaments where you get a chance to imprison murderers and rapists. Paramout Knight honorary title is here as well.  I assume a lot of Westerosi/Faith of the Seven flavor is here.  You have to have 18 Learning to eat your babies otherwise...

Picking your heir with constant coin flip events.  Seems OP to me.  At this stage in the game there's not much left to do, so maybe merging all the bloodlines would be a better end game goal.  That's twice we're passing on marrying our Lords Paramount to quickly get them to leave factions, so if the Reach and Westerlands both have ambitious Kings or something, it could get really *dracarys*y quickly.  I'm not very good at killing off first borns yet, so a better player may not need this.  I just need more practice but we should be able to go crazy with our divine polygamy.

Leadership
I'm really confused here.  There seems to be no holy wars and no excommunication.  

Autonomous you can't even divorce your wife, and I don't see any upsides to this.  Your Stormsingers will pay taxes to their liege instead of the high priest? It replaces part of the Peaceful bonus with +1 Martial.  

Autocephalous and Hierocratic are basically the same as there are no other independent nations of Valyrians.  I can't see any difference at all, at least.

Hierocratic or Temporal?  Hierocratic you must request divorce but your heir can be any religion;  Temporal the heir to the Iron Throne must be Reformed Valyrian.  Temporal gives +1 piety a month and allows you to divorce your wife.  It seems a toss up because you have dark divorce.  

Temporal or God-King?  I honestly can't find a difference.  I'd imagine there's flavor events.  My name is listed as High God even with Temporal.

Hi, so I'm currently a member of the Old Way society. Normally, when you get to to the hero rank as a member, it triggers a chance to build your legend. When legend hits a 100, it triggers a quest that ends in what happened in picture 2, giving you a unique bloodline.

467,dkp0bf,20 uniterrupted generations of strong/genius lords with no console commands,"I started off as Harren the Black and reformed the Drowned God faith. I chose Meritocracy, which allowed me to choose my heir. In order to do this though, I had to go around and loot infidel temples to get myself to 50 moral authority, so I chose to raid dragonstone while Aegon was busy with Volantis. Basically, I redid what I did in this video:

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5lCK9XVc7k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5lCK9XVc7k) 

After I was done there, I had about 20 salt wives and got my first strong/genius heir. 

From there, I went ahead and rinse and repeated this strategy over and over again. I haven't expanded at all from my starting area, but I've spent the money I got from looting on upgrading my demense and building cities, castles, and seahalls throughout the riverlands, not to mention spreading my faith.

I have over 80k levies from just the riverlands and the iron isles. This game was amazing.

Last note, due to my raiding, the rest of the seven kingdoms are in absolute chaos. I started off with dragonstone, wiping out house Targareyn, so they got replaced by Valareyon, who I then raided to extinction, so they got replaced by Baratheon, who got conquered by the Stormland.

The Stormlands I raided third, but because I already mentioned them... I raided Storm's End, taking the daughter of Agrella as a salt wife (she actually gave me a useable heir with strong/genius traits. She was strong btw). I toppled house Durrandon who only had two members at that time, and they were replaced by House Connigton. They fell without my help and were replaced by House Rainwood, who fell with my help and were replaced by... House Quoherys somehow.

I raided the Reach second, collapsing house Gardener, who were replaced by the florents. I sacked Highgarden, taking the Florent Queen as my salt wife, leaving a child on the throne. House Redwyne rebelled taking the throne, and the Florents and the Redwynes have been fighting ever since, for about 18 generations. The best part is that the fighting is near constant. Every time one of them puts together an army big enough to win, I come in and crush it before raiding both the Arbor and Highgarden, kidnapping a princess from both sides and leaving.

And so forth. The map hasn't changed much really. The only person that benefited from this would be the Rock arguably, because they got land from the Reach, but they only have 30k soldiers so it's fine.",1,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CK2GameOfthrones/comments/dkp0bf/20_uniterrupted_generations_of_stronggenius_lords/,2019-10-21 00:06:39

In spite of the tragedies, Rhaegar's rule is marked by peace, stability and prosperity. Oldstones and Summerhall are rebuilding, everybody's happy.
