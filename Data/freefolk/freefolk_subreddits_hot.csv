45,e5clqr,"Sansa, Sweetie, I'm So Sorry (An Ode To The Disserviced Red Wolf)","**TL;DR: this is a long post. it's basically apologizing to Sansa for all the ways they failed her as a character,making her victory a non-victory and her memory a depressing one.**

&#x200B;

Sansa Stark, Lady Of Winterfell...**sweetie, I'm so sorry.**

You were given a journey leading to Season 4 that was meant to have you in the Eyrie learning how to truly play the game, from the Master that was Littlefinger. After having endured such horror and abuse at the hands of the Elite Royalty, you were saved by a man you would one day learn was bad news, but who did give you mercy where you could not find it elsewhere. You were to be named Alayne Stone, little finger's bastard daughter, and have a front row seat to how such a MASTER Manipulator played the Game Of Thrones. Form there you would absorb this knowledge, tempered by your own inner kindness, the thing they couldn't beat out of you.

But they took that away from you, and I'm so sorry.

**I'm sorry** that instead of staying in the Eyrie, you were shipped off to Winterfell where you were forced into another character's storyline because the show runners couldn't find any interest in your true path. **I'm sorry** that you were forced to suffer sexual and physical abuse at the hands of Ramsey Bolton, whose father helped kill your mother and brother. **I'm sorry** that you had to absorb the brunt of his sadism instead of any political savvy that you were meant for.

**I'm sorry** that you were written to be so mistrustful of everyone around you (however understandable) that you kept your later correspondence with LF from Jon Snow, your brother, who you had pleaded to help you take back Winterfell for your family. **I'm sorry** that you were made to not tell Jon about the POSSIBILITY of the Vale knights, even though it made sense that you didn't want to give him hope for something you weren't sure of, something that rested on LF's obsession with you, not the Vale's loyalty to Tully Blood (AHEM). **I'm sorry** that your experiences made you certain that Rickon couldn't be saved from the Sadist that was Ramsay and somehow people made it to mean you didn't truly care about him, or Jon, who nearly died before the Vale knights came.

**I'm sorry** that you were written to be envious of Jon Snow and snarky with him in a way that made all the survival skills you learned in politics from the South COMPLETELY POINTLESS. **I'm sorry** that your *correct* assertion that Jon had to be smarter than Robb And Ned was accompanied by your loss of decorum when it came to the meeting where he announced he'd meet with Daenerys. 

**I'm sorry** that you were written to actively get into a fight with Arya (check the scripts y'all), to the point where you sent Brienne away so you wouldn't share her with Arya, where you easily fall for Baelish's BS about Arya plotting to kill or overthrow you, and where you were legitimately planning on killing Arya for treason before you knocked on Bran's door to be sure (in a deleted scene). **I'm sorry** that the script showed Arya's accusation (of you placating the lords so they could give YOU the crown if Jon didn't make it back) to be true, something that you and her both knew without saying it out loud.

**I'm sorry** that for all the fuckery LF put you through, you needed to have Bran show you how untrustworthy he was. **I'm sorry** that the show made you the SLOWEST OF ALL LEARNERS when you deserved to have learned so much faster than you used to, because that's GROWTH.

**I'm sorry** that in Season 8, you were made to forget everything you ever learned about surviving rulers you feared by openly being petty, passive aggressive and hostile to a woman with three dragons and more armies than you that came to help fight the Dead with you. **I'm sorry** that it turns out the writers were at least consistent with you letting the Lords have a problem with Jon and not defending him so they could possibly unite under you just in case. **I'm sorry** that you were made to disregard all the pros of living under a Queen with more men, food, and resources than you to help you destroy your biggest enemy Cersei (and the NK). 

~~And while we're at it, Arya, sweetie I'm so sorry they fucked you up in the same way, making both Stark sisters mean girls in the boyfriend's family that shun the GF just because.~~

Sansa, **I'm sorry** that you weren't properly written to exercise your GoT Manipulation skills in the talk with Daenerys, trying half heartedly for a few minutes before dropping the act and losing whatever advantage you could have gotten by winning her trust and infiltrating the system.

**I'm sorry** that you were made to trust Jaime over Brine's word (who loves him) but mistrust Daenerys despite your brother who fought and nearly died for you.

**I'm sorry** that the script decided to delete the scene where you and Tyrion pulled out the daggers you were given and actively risked your lives trying to fight whatever wights you could. **I'm sorry** they preferred to have you just sit there in silence and try to prod Tyrion's loyalty to you versus Daenerys at the completely wrong time. **I'm sorry** that the heroism you showed in favor of Missandei was determined NOT GOOD ENOUGH for the final draft.

**I'm sorry** that even after a fight with Death they decided you hadn't changed one bit from the experience that Dany and her people helped save you from. **I'm sorry** that you and Arya were completely devolved into characters that would say shit like ""Arya's the one who killed the Night King!"" and ""She's not one of us!"" without ever trying to ask Jon what made him trust her, or what even happened in Dragonstone to begin with.

**I'm sorry** that the writers completely washed away your wit by having you tell Tyrion the secret, knowing (according to DnD) that he would tell Varys and things would go from there. **I'm sorry** that you were made to knowingly cause chaosh to overthrow a woman on her way to kill your most obvious enemy Cersei, who was even less likely to give you your independence than Dany. 

**I'm sorry** that once again, you were made to kind of forget that Bran could fill in blanks that you would need to get the full story on anything. **I'm even more sorry** that they didn't let you realize that killing a Queen with one or two dragons would mean doom for the whole of Westerns. Maybe at a later time at least?

**I'm sorry** that you were actually written to ask Tyrion, ""WhY hEr?"" like you were some jealous bratty child version of Cersei, scared of a younger, more beautiful queen taking all you held dear. It was the most insulting thing to your character in Season 8 no doubt.  

**I'm sorry** that you were completely absent from Episode 5 and only came in Episode 6 to play badass with Grey Worm like you had any ground to stand on. I'm sorry you and bran kind of forgot that there must always be a stark in winter fell. 

~~I'm sorry that they made Arya's sole point of being there to sass Yara Greyjoy, whose gangster was completely disrespected but i've already spoken about that.~~

**I'm sorry** that you were written to not share Jon's identity, the thing that could have changed his fate, and instead focused on having Bran let you have the North because the Northerners would have rather had you than the last true born male heir to Ned Stark on the seat of highest power.

**I'm sorry** that you and Jon had incomplete closure, no discussion, no argument, no unpacking of all the shit you'd been through since Season 6, as siblings who I thought were trying to be closer. **I'm sorry** that you were made to ask for forgiveness before apologizing. 

Most of all, **I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,** that in the final scene, which was supposed to be your moment of triumph, you were sat in a chair, with a pretty white dress and a crown (the thing you mocked jon about possibly getting in S7), surrounded by the ""bloody wind vanes"" known as your new subjects, cheering you on with their swords and chants...all alone. Your sister gone. Your brother gone. Your other brother, not even your brother. The biggest moment of your life, the defining moment that was the end of your story on this show, the culmination of all that you had endured...and no one was there. None of your family, none of the people that mattered. The pack was broken, and you're own your own, surrounding by Lords and Ladies whose loyalties have proven so faulty and fickle that you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life.

*That was supposed to be your happy ending.*

You were rewritten, reworked, shredded, broken, and put back together wrong. You were disrespected, assassinated, shrunken down to the worst parts of you while being inflated to be smarter and better than everyone else, because while you were being inflated, they punctured and deflated the people around you, thereby making your rise an empty hollow shell, and you as Queen a HUSK of what it should have been. 

In conclusion, **You deserved better than this.** You deserved to be the morally grey politically sound good hearted Lady of Winterfell who knew how to work her way around other players of the game, no matter what, because your will to survive was bigger than foolish pride. They took all that away from you, to the point where even Sansa Fans felt disappointed (maybe not all, but they do exist).

The majority of the GoT Fandom will write you off as a sincerely awful character from the start, and S8 just proved it for them. But you weren't an awful character, not always. You were better than that. Your potential was wrenched from your arc, and all that's left is a depressing whiff of what should have been.

So Sansa, Sweetie, ***I Really Am So Sorry That They Did This To You.***

60,e5fpue,Just rewatched The Long Night battle and I’ll never not be bitter about what could have been,"I’m still bitter about Season 7 and 8. Yes it’s extremely sad to give that much of a shit about a TV show but I still do as, for me, when I started watching this show I knew it was going to be something different. It subverted expectations organically through consequence, not just to fool the audience. 

I was just watching the battle on YT and scene where the dragons join the battle and you’ve got Jaime, Tormund, Sam, Sansa and Arya watching in awe as the dragons try to destroy the army of the dead outside Winterfell. It made me sad because we didn’t even get a scene with Arya, Daenerys and the dragons plus it was a little bit underwhelming how the dragons were used in the battle and even how they moved (seemed to move really quickly and more cgi’d than in the past)

We didn’t see one conversation at the battle meeting about the White Walkers or get a scene with the Valyrian steel swords Vs White Walkers, no Melisandre and the red priests against the Night King. Jaime Lannister should have been protecting Bran after what he did to him. Bran should have done something with his powers instead of just watching the battle, the NK should have had a decent motivation preferably involving the Starks of the past. Sam should have died, Ghost and Nymeria should have been involved, I actually thought Arya was going to kill the dragon with that weapon she asked to be specially made for her to clear the way for Jon. Battle tactics were dreadful coming from men who’d fought the dead already and knew their weaknesses. I could go on and on and on about S7&8 but I’ve  probably bored you enough. 

Anyway rant over. Apologies, it’s just every time GoT pops into my head I can’t believe how badly they fucked up the greatest TV show of all time.",4,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/e5fpue/just_rewatched_the_long_night_battle_and_ill/,2019-12-03 14:18:17

82,e5mil6,Normal Actions,"When you say that is normal you mean that action usually happens and if it doesn't happen that is a rare occurrence.

So when we are talking about the events which have been happened in the world we are talking about some normal events which are caused by some specific actions.

For example when you when you aim somebody with a gun and you shoot him in the head it is normal for him to die and if he survives it is a miracle which is an abnormal case.

all I want to say is when you choose a dictator it is normal to commit genocide so you shouldn't blame him for what he has done you should blame yourself because of choosing a dictator as your leader.

So when a dictator kills lots of people just to save his throne that is a normal action and he shouldn't be blamed as a virus isn't blamed for people's death and also you are blamed because of your choice as those people are blamed because of not taking care of their hygiene situation.

In the end you might say that I'm wrong or crazy but if you look at this issue again you would see that I have a point and you can't expect a wolf to treat a sheep with kindness.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/e5mil6/normal_actions/,2019-12-03 22:50:48

I rarely posted in this group while GOT was on, but I did read it constantly (i.e. obsessively). On a serious note, I am wondering if anyone is actually having a hard time IRL with the way this show ended? I am honestly surprised by the extent to which it has impacted me. Whenever I have down time and start to think about it, I legitimately feel like someone punched me in the gut. I feel sad a lot and am currently crying as I write this post (after watching the ending clip from TWOW). I never thought that something fictional could impact me this way, and after several months, I am starting to feel concerned that this is somewhat abnormal. I do not know. It would be so much easier if I could not think of some storyline that was abandoned or character development that was ruined or plot hole that makes no fucking sense every single fucking time I think about it. Sigh... Does anyone else feel the same way? Please do not be mean. I am still mourning lol.",6,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/e5axy6/on_a_serious_note/,2019-12-03 06:35:55

I'm not trying to brigade this sub. I love the community we have here, and I fully agree that D and D royally screwed the GOT franchise with S8. However, this is r/freefolk. We do not kneel. And right now, we are kneeling. We are kneeling under the weight of repetitive content and re-used ideas. I do not care if I get downvoted or banned for this, do what you will. But take an example from people like Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington, and try and move on. Sure, bash D and D all you want, but get some fresh OC in there too. We do not kneel. Make Bobby B proud.

181,e4qnlc,"""WhY sHoUlD tHe NoRtH fIgHt A sOuThReN wAr?"" because it's their war too.","I noticed a bit of a phenomenon after Jon bent the knee. People were suddenly furious that Jon had pledged himself to go help Dany fight for ""a fucking chair"" when he should have been fighting for Northern Independence. The northerners themselves seemed to think that whatever happened in the South was none of their concern as they had declared themselves independent. From the lady of Winterfell to The Faceless Assassin, the general idea was that the North didn't need to help Dany do anything in regards to Cersei Lannister because they had cut themselves off from the Iron Throne and that was clearly that.

Allow me to remind you all of a scene. A scene in Season 7, the earlier episodes. A Scene where Jon Snow received a raven containing a letter from Cersei Lannister commanding him to come south and bend the knee, or suffer the fate of all traitors. Jon had more pressing matters on his mind (like the DEAD) but Sansa, who had NOT seen the dead, said to him, ""You've been so focused on the Enemy to the North that you've forgotten about the enemy to the south."" She warned him how Cersei was dangerous, that anyone who has ever gotten in her way has somehow managed to die. And she knew that Cersei hated her for what she thought was Joffery's murder. Even if she didn't, Cersei wanted all Seven kingdoms, and there was no way she would let the North go without a fight.

It wasn't a Southern War. it was a war for Westeros.

The North can play isolationist all they want, but until the Crown recognizes their independence, they will always be fighting off invasions from the South, attempts to quell the Northern ""rebellion."" Cerise in particular wanted to deal with whatever was left of the Targ and Stark men after their dealings with dead, not simple so she could kill Dany, but so she could retake ALL OF WESTERNS. ALL SEVEN KINGDOMS. And the North is a frozen wasteland with starving small folk and tired soldiers who could never. EVER. Beat the combined efforts of Cerise's men, the Golden Company, and the Iron Fleet. The those northerners would have been ripped to shreds in no time.

You'd think that would be a problem for Sansa Stark, lady Of Winterfell, who knows who Cersei is more than anyone, and knows that she will take this time to strike them at their most vulnerable, like she said she would. You'd think the Lady of Winterfell would want to maybe send away the small folk and secure the castle just in case C's men attack them. You'd THINK Arya Stark, the She-Wolf with a special list, would also be aware that as long as Cersei is alive, the Starks and the North will never be safe. You'd think that any of these Northerners would rather choose a Dragon rider that fought alongside them in war than a coward who broke her word and wants to kill their liege Starks.

You'd think.

But instead...""a southern war"" is how the last Battle is framed. And pro-Stark Stans bought it.",29,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/e4qnlc/why_should_the_north_fight_a_southren_war_because/,2019-12-02 03:28:54

And don't get me wrong this is not to blame the Jon/Dany relationship as there is a good story that can be told there. But D&D didn't know how to tell it. They had no idea how to handle the 2 main characters finally meeting and interacting and literally ***everything*** else in the story suffered because of it. It was a domino effect that made all the other main characters start to act OOC. Jon and Dany included. 

I fully expect GRRM to handle this meeting/relationship 100x better, but it should serve as a warning to him too. This meeting/relationship/story arc has to be handled very carefully because as have now seen it has the potential to blow the whole story up if messed up the way D&D did.

But it's a great irony isn't it. Everyone waited for years for these two characters to meet and when they finally did....it sent the show straight into the abyss.

339,e44jvo,I re-wrote Season 8. Full text of the story we deserved inside.,"Some of this is out of order, since it’s organized more into story threads and I’m not editing it. If I forgot something just keep it to yourself, this was a impromptu writing project. I am coming at this as an annoyed 27 year old audio engineer and programmer, not a professional scriptwriter. 



THE RULES


- Only use the information given up until the finale of season 7

- 
Must include all the major setpieces of season 8, all the big locations, and must revolve mostly around the characters included. Cannot be some ground up re-write.

- Must follow the general timeline given in Season 8. This is an edit, not a full restructuring. 

- Must adhere to GoT season 1-7 conventions: no one is safe, deals are made for personal AND political reasons, motivations run deep, relationships are the ties that make moments matter. 

- If the show writers get to play with funny time/space arrangments, so do fucking I. 
________

Open with raid on Euron’s ship, only yara and theon take Euron prisoner. Kick in balls, jokes all around.

Theon Goes to winterfell

Yara goes to iron isles


Cersei fakes rumor that she is marching on winterfell to take it. Jon and danerys take dragons, dothraki, and elite unsllied down to try and meet her, it never happens. They know she meant for them to waste their time, and that they can’t make it back in time. They decide to march on kings landing. The discussions leading up to this moment are super tense, and Jon is even more torn. Sansa isn’t just fond of leading, her hatred of Dany is justified as she leaves with half her forces to take on a rumor that definitely seems like it came from Cersei. She gets word that she was correct, and could have prevented a lot more bloodshed. This infuriates her and she makes a big speech to the remaining forces about this being their chance to delay the walkers enough for Jon to amass a larger force. She sends ravens once again, this time telling everyone that Danerys betrayed the snows and that they will most likely die. 


Knight king attacks the same, NO dothraki charge happens though because that was dumb.


The big night of conversations still happens, only this is where the news about Jon’s true identity is passed around to those left at the castle. 


The hound ends up killing night king, lighting his sword is lord of light dude’s last action as the dead don’t stand by peacefully, but fight to the last man. 


The Hound has to overcome his fear of fire to kill the night kind. The hound is mortally wounded during the fight, using the night king’s spear stabbed through him as a chance to land the killing blow. It’s fucking brutal. 


Sansa tries to care for him before he dies. He reveals how much he cares for Aria, requests her kill the mountain. Sansa is confused, unsure of if she will relay the message. Later, she will write down the message to Aria, but omit the request. This sows seeds of distrust, as Aria is listening nearby as The Hound dies. This is why she is so resolute to abandon her sister and go to kings landing. 


Brianne remains with Sansa at all times because of course she does because she made a fucking oath and is loyal. No romance that didn’t work out in the end. 


Bran reinfoces the long night battle by warging into huge pack of Dire Wolves, descended from the ones the kids save in the first season, who save the house that bears them as a sigil. The Dragon is wrecking king’s landing as the hound kills the night king, his death the only thing able to wound it. Sometime while The Hound is fighting the night kind he has to say “Fuck the first men”. 


Theon still dies heriocally fighting alongside the pack of stark wolves. This is mentioned during his funeral, that he went down a true Stark, alongside his brother, alongside his house’s sigil. 


Shot of Aria going down to a holding cell in winterfell. She confronts Euron, then opens the door, steps through it, and closes it after her. We see her pull out a set of surgical tools from the faceless men temple. Fade out to black. 


Bron shows up outside of the castle, does not confront jamie, instead shoots and wounds him. Jamie bargains, says they’re working for the same side and he’ll give bron double if he takes him to cersei alive, which bron was already planning on hauling a dead body or part of it back to kings landing so this actually makes some goddamn sense.


 
Jamie leaves secret message for tyrion that king’s landing will be lost without him. Tyrion is doubting his own abilities and considers staying with sansa, especially after their moment in the basement. Highlight Sansa mourning over the lost north men, her distrust of Danny, and her doubt in Jon. Tyrion and Sansa could stay in the north and start rebuilding, and it seems appealing to tyrion. He makes a speech about his cleverness running out, and he opts for the safe route. He will later be the one to receive ravens from Naath, stating that they will be sending aid to him and sansa to begin again, if they are still alive, and if not then they will be marching to cut off the walkers. They don’t know of the battle’s results, and this gives a reason to bring back the coolest reigon in a meaningful way since Tyrion was seen by them as the mastermind behind freeing their people since they’re not stupid and wouldn’t just accept that a dragon queen bullied slavers into freeing everyone. His guilt mounts and he steals a horse and rides fast for Kings landing to meet with Jon and Dany. He will meet up with them as they have the standoff outside of kings landing. (I don't feel like this is a strong moment, but I don't know what to do to make these characters end up in these spots sooooooooooooo deal with it)


Take dothraki to kings landing. It makes more sense for them to be senselessly killing in the city rather than the controlled unsullied. The unsullied act as the vanguard around VIPs.


The party is still ambushed on their way by the ships, but this time far before they get to the bay, because no she did not just “forget” about the fucking boats. But Qiburn is the weapon/strategy master commanding the scorpion ships. Make him more of a leader. Show him with maps of traps, scorpions, wildfire stores. Make him a tactician, not just a wierd old skinny dude. 


Cersei needs establishing shots to show her breaking down as news of the north’s victory over the Wights reaches her. She is desperate to preserve her baby’s life. She must keep it a secret since she doesn’t have euron there like in the shitty season 8 script. Finding a ‘father’ for her baby is her motivation in the short term, to ensure her rule. That way we can keep her a selfish, but sympathetic, character instead of a one dimensional evil lady. 


Quiburn does take down a dragon after he lures them in with ships fitted with older model scorpions. Maybe make the new ones unfurl or unfold in a new way to illustrate it. After the dragons butcher the bait ships, the new scorpions are revealed, he fires and kills one dragon and wounds the other. 


They also take out dany’s ships, but you see missande actually get in the boat and start rowing as per greyworm’s orders instead of just not establishing that she survived. It doesn’t have to be a surprise. 


Confrentation outside of city gates happens, but this time with dothraki and unsullied in huge numbers. They’ve brought Euron (aria in disguise this is the big plot twist) as leverage, he’s offered as a trade for missande. He shouts that they already had a deal about Cersei fucking him so she better make the trade (Aria tortured this out of him or he bragged abt it as she took his face because he’s a douche), Cersei realizes that this could be her chance to have an explainable father for the baby. This is why the trade actually is allowed to happen. . 


Dramatic walk out of missande, who is chained and gagged tight. She keeps shaking her head and begging them to stop making her walk. She has a fuse running back to the castle and she has bottles of wildfire on her. She blows up and takes out the two people who ran to get to her, greyworm and tyrion. Cersei seems to start to break, as Euron is brought in, realizing she killed her brother. This is also what starts danery’s break, not just one person but many of her friends have been killed. The final trigger for dany will be one of the ravens from Sansa calling her a traitor and claiming the walkers may be marching up to kings landing. 


At the same time, Bron and Jamie are landing at the cave to the secret tunnel entrance to the red keep.  


Once inside, Euron pulls off his face, it’s aria, fight’s the mountain for the hound, wins. Aria goes straight for Cersei, bron and jamie burst through door, bron shoots aria with the crossbow, throwing her over a balcony to fall. Jamie is distraught to hear of Tyrion’s death, and has been wounded and betrayed by Cersei. Then cut to the battle playing out.


Danerys is more crazed than the original bc tyrion was her confidant about her lonliness and Jon ignoring her affection at dragonstone. He is in trouble, but is her last family and last source of comfort, taking the place of the original season 8’s Tyrion’s convo with Jamie. Danny feels that she is losing her family, friends, advisors. Tyrion dying is the crazy trigger. 


In her flying around,  she prematurely sets off the wildfire. This breaks up the standoff between Cersiei, Aria, Jon, ect. Jamie tries to flee with Cersei, but his wounds are still present and slowing him down. Cersei is injured in the stomach possible. 


Wildfire traps of barrel’s being launched into the air. Aria is escaping through wildfire exploding. Chaoitc. Rather than Aria’s escape through the city, it’s Jon, who was trying to stop the dothraki from comitting atrocities, and the northmen are joining them in pillaging. 


Aria is mortally wounded but also making her way through the city. That woman doesn’t need her to motivate, she helps arya, flipping the roles.


Drogon gets caught by a blast, tossed sideways, bleating and crying out. He skids across rooftops, and dany is thrown straight into a burning whirlwind of wildfire. Drogon sees this and desperately tries to get to her again, and in his struggling across roofs and alleyways crushes the woman helping Arya. Jon sees this go down and runs up and pulls arya away at the last second, Drogon now passing and continuing to scramble for Dany. As he gets closer to the burning, its towards the red keep. He punches through the floor, falls, and breathes a little fire as he falls through. He sets off a huge cache of wildfire, and is burned alive. We do not see Dany.


The blast rocks the red keep. Jamie and Cersei are making their way through and are tossed around like rag dolls.Then a roof collapses, and ceresei is impaled through the stomach. Brutality like GRRM would want. This takes place on the wrecked stairwell that the cleganebowl happened. 

Jamie tries to go down a little bit, but finds a wall of wildfire creeping up. Cersei tells him to go back up and climb down and run. She wants her love to escape at the last second. She begs him and he seems to agree. 


Then, we linger on Cersei. Have her cry. Mourn. She’s not dying as fast as we thought. 


Dany walks out of the wildfire, crazed eyes, naked, bloody. She finds Cersei, grabs her hair, talks to her, monologues, all the while losing it even more. She grabs a rock to smash Cersei’s head, and does not hesitate, bared teeth, totally resolved, flames behind her, then Jamie’s sword comes out of the front of her throat. Dany is dead and Jamie is the King and Queen slayer, two mad rulers. He says “The things I do for love”. Only now its hard and heavy.


He stabs Cersei to end her suffering at the last second. He runs, ducks into a side passage, and vanishes. 


The red keeps last wildfire stores finally ignite, blowing holes out the side, and we sweep the camera up to the throne room, exposed in the same way as the finale. We see blasts making their way up, and finally the floor explodes up, and the iron throne falls down, into a now hellish hole of flames that was the interior of the red keep. We see Jon and Arya watching this from below, but two dothraki offer them their horses and ride them out of the city. No tandom horses or surviving here. 


You end the episode with silence, with sadness, with stilness. Let the loss sink in. 


For the finale, you have the walk through the city with Jon and Davos, up to the ruins of the red keep. But instead of tension over Dany, it is resigned weight. 


Jon calls for the remaining men to come with him. The Dothraki do not obey, and Sir Davos reminds Jon about them splintering when their Khal is killed because YOU NEED TO REFERENCE OLD SHIT. They scatter, but as they leave a warrior comes and points to some horses they have left for him. They honor him in their tongue for being the right hand of their Khalessi, then he leaves. The remaining scraps of the army gather, including Arya in a coach, and turn back north.


Your midpoint becomes Sansa’s time to shine, as she has sent out a call for all the house leaders to convey at winterfell. She has received word of what happened, and with Dany gone knows that there is a power vaccum. The red keep and kings landing are actually beyond repair, as was portrayed. 


Sam brings a book, and takes a private moment with Brianne. He reveals it to be the records of the lannisters, and asks her to narrate to him how to fill out Jamie’s entry. She recites the exact same words, though very emotionally, then stands, and is strong again. She immediately breaks up a fight as she exits the small study into the main plaza, where winterfell is being actively rebuilt. A moment of levity would really help. 


We get an absolute parade of character moments of all the house leaders, often them bad mouthing each other. Include the assasian women, Dorne, and their enteourages. Make kings landing feel packed. This is the chance to bring back all the Some are angry for some houses not showing up to defend winterfell from the undead, some have Varus’s notes and are angrily shouting about Jon either being the rightful ruler, or the third crazy targaryen. You take this shouting and bickering through cuts to them arguing through a large meal, then them arguing as they file into the great hall and sit down, arguing rising in volume and intensity until Sansa stands and shouts for quiet. They all respect her and shut the fuck up.


Sansa gives speech about how the game of thrones is over, that it was a game played with people’s lives, that it was a game rigged for the cruel and tyrannical. 


She proposes Jon as ruler in the north, with some discomfort.


 This rallies many people, with a minority booing.


Jon stands up and waves for quiet. Explains that he needs to go north once more, to re-swear to the new night’s watch, and to give the freemen their lives and forest back. This is his duty. He quotes the maester, “Love is the death of duty. And now that I have lost that which I loved most, my duty calls once again.”


Someone shouts about who will be king. Jon turns, as the music swells, and smiles straight at Sansa. He motions for quiet. “We can all agree that Ned Stark was the best of us. Who here commands the same respect as he did? Who here can quiet the storm and then call it to spring to life and battle for the lives of all the innocent living? Who can make you fuckers shut up?” He begins to clap. She seems shocked, but slowly one by one, the music crescendoing, everyone turns to Sansa and applauds. She stands, tearfully, as they raise swords and call out “The queen in the north”


Cut to Jon riding away, flanked by Arya and Davos. Sansa asks him where he is going, and he looks somberly off into distance.


“I was brought back for a reason, and while I don’t know what that reason is, I’m pretty sure part of it is to redeem my names.”


Sansa looks confused at the plural.


“I need to redeem the name of targaryen, my true house…” and looks at the winterfell sigil, “And continue to make my true father proud, in the name of my true home. And I think that has to start with rebuilding the night’s watch, and helping the Freemen reclaim their home.”

My thought was dd tried hard to made bad copies of other bad movies, but if I’m not mistaken ASOIAF turning people into wolves/ravens, for nearly the exact same purpose (even gazing into the sky with blank eyes while “warging”) predates the 2005 movie but almost a decade, but wasn’t on film yet... the similarities are downright eerie and, unless these are just real common plot devices, looks like d&d found a horrible movie and said “f- it,  let’s take a movie that’s 11% on rotten tomatoes, ramp it up 1000X and shove that down people’s throats.

397,e3ay0h,Sansa done wrong,"In season eight Sansa did a detestable thing that led to catastrophic turmoil.


She spilled a secret. A secret that she had no business spilling. A secret that could lead to the spillage of blood.


By confessing Jon’s parentage to the Hottest Gossip in Westeros^TM , Sansa opened a Pandora’s Box of Westerosi politics and scheming unseen since the death of Robert Baratheon I, that ultimately led to the destruction of Kings Landing and the consecutive deaths of Queens Cersei Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen. 


The real atrocity of this betrayal on the part of Sansa isn’t in the results, it’s in the method. Sansa swore a promise to Jon in front of the Weirwood tree. She was sworn to secrecy. By going straight to an outsider with this intel, she disgraced her families sanctum.


Sansa betrayed Northern custom and was rewarded for it, this is a betrayal of what the show originally promised, which was an uncompromising world disinterested in modern norms. She should have been questioned and tried for treason when she discussed Northern Independence with the conquering Queen of Westeros. Jon had already relinquished claim on the North by the time this convo occurred.


 To be hailed as Queen of the North at the *fin* of this is ridiculous. Bran fucking Stark was due to be King of the Seven Kingdoms at the time (ridiculous) so separation is detrimental and foolish to say the least. Not to mention Sansa Stark has no experience ruling a kingdom, nor any official control outside of Jon Snow’s appointee as Warden.


I’m sorry but I’m really unhappy with Sansa’s happy ending being at the expense of Danaerys’ unhappy ending.",58,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/e3ay0h/sansa_done_wrong/,2019-11-29 09:30:27

&#x200B;

that awkward introduction meeting between: \*bran and jon\*

\*dany and sansa\*

&#x200B;

Bran: ""we don't have time for this.""

&#x200B;

Jon and Bran exchange looks

&#x200B;

Bran: ""jon, i have something very important to tell you""

&#x200B;

jon give a worried look to Daenerys and bran noticed

&#x200B;

Bran: ""just us the northerners.""

&#x200B;

\*awkward silence\*

&#x200B;

daenerys looking at Jorah questionably, asking for advice by looks. Jorah smiled faintly and nod at her. which leads to her giving the half-disapproving nod at jon

&#x200B;

jon and bran nodding at each others, Jon continues by pushing Bran's wheelchair , Sansa looking at daenerys, smirking at her ,bowing and says ""pardon us, your grace"" then following her brothers, and the three of them went inside winterfell castle, in the hall where all of them were throwing a feast during roberts arrival which feels like a life time ago.

&#x200B;

\*in front of the fireplace\*

&#x200B;

Arya was waiting for them, he run and hugged Jon. happily.

&#x200B;

jon, shocked with the realization that arya is still alive,well and here, in their ancestral home

: ""why weren't you outside? greeting me and the dragon queen? i thought out all of the people of winterfell you'd be the only one who excited to see the dragons""

&#x200B;

Arya giving needle to jon: ""i saw the dragons on the gate, then i realize have something more important to do, i need to sharpen needle, my own ""dark sister""(dark sister is the name of sword visenya targaryen ,which arya idolize had) i want you to see , i took good care of it. i am myself also so much sharper compared to the last time we meet""(lol the cringe)

&#x200B;

sansa smiles :""i can confirm that ""sharper"" bit.""

&#x200B;

the three exchanges looks then laughs.

&#x200B;

bran looking at them impatiently.

&#x200B;

bran to Jon : ""Jon, you were dead""

&#x200B;

sansa and area looking at each others ,confused.

&#x200B;

jon: ""how did u know?""

&#x200B;

bran ignoring the question :""and you were brought back""

&#x200B;

jon: ""by the red lady""

&#x200B;

arya looking intensely at Jon, rather furious

&#x200B;

arya: ""what happened? who killed you!???""

&#x200B;

Jon: ""deserters of the nights watch...., but the most important thing, I'm here now, i don't know how, i don't know why, but thanks to lady melisandre, i am alive and well to see you three still alive""

&#x200B;

arya: ""you can't trust her!""

&#x200B;

bran: ""i dont, and it wasn't her who brought Jon back""

&#x200B;

silence and exchange looks between the four

&#x200B;

Bran: ""it was me,it was Brandon Stark,it was the raven, it was the night king"".

&#x200B;

jon sansa and arya together: "" but how?!!!""

&#x200B;

zooming to bran's face

&#x200B;

zoom out and it was a scene several years ago when Jon was about to be resurrected ""supposedly"" by melisandre

&#x200B;

Jon was lifeless on the death bed where Davos was pursuing melisandre about wether she can bring back jon to life.,

&#x200B;

meanwhile in the background, there's the three eyed crow in the window with 2 black eyes, and 1 white eyes in the middle, it glance at Jons corpse for a second and flew out of the castle black, beyond the wall,

&#x200B;

it reached to the branch of a tree, below ,night king and all his armies was massacring the wildlings. the crow observing the scene for few moments, then intentionally flew towards the face of one of the walkers,attacking his face, then it got killed by the walker's spears.

&#x200B;

it fell to the ground and all 3 of its eyes turned into regular black eyes of a crow

&#x200B;

but only for for few seconds.

&#x200B;

then it begins,

&#x200B;

the night king was raising both of his arms, resurrecting all the dead wildlings who one by one opened their blue eyes (hard home episode for references)

&#x200B;

and , so does the crow (this is where bear walkers, mammoth walkers , horse walkers make sense)

&#x200B;

the crow standing up from the blood stained snow , shrugs his wings, shakes the snow off, and one of it eyes turned back to white, while the other one turned blue just like the walkers. it now has blue, white , and black eyes.

&#x200B;

it flew back as soon as it can, back to castle black, flying sharply down throwing itself into the chimney and dissapears

&#x200B;

at the same moment,its that scene where ghost was waking up from his nap,whimpers, he sense something fell through the chimney

&#x200B;

jon open his eyes, gasping for air.

&#x200B;

\*back to present time\*

&#x200B;

jon was in shock, looking at his siblings

&#x200B;

jon to bran :""but why?""

&#x200B;

(oh jonny boy there is still another surprise in the store for you)

&#x200B;

bran: ""i saw it,i was there, i saw you getting stabbed by that boy my age, i saw you on that bed with ghost lying below your death bed. but you are the true heir of the seven kingdoms

bran continues: "", and you are the only way to kill the night king, you need to be alive to defeat him, I've been observing him raising the deads, I've seen him with the wights made of giant elephants, I've seen it because somehow i can get myself into his head. i figured maybe i can warg into the crows as usual, to see whether i can transfer the Night King's ability to raise the deads to your body, its a risk, really, i don't know wether you will be brought back alive with blue eyes and start to kill the rest or the night watch, and let the wall unprotected. i don't even know  whether i can still be Brandon stark after that.

&#x200B;

but here you are. ""

&#x200B;

sansa: ""but if the Night king is dead, the rest of he walkers will be gone too, so does the wights and any part of his armies""

&#x200B;

arya who now realizes what sansa just said, moved her stares from her sister, to Jon, and then Bran, frantically. ""are you saying he needed to sacrifice himself for all of us and even cersei?""

&#x200B;

Jon looking at bran looking for answers,

It's time to let your guard down. HBO, it's alright, it's time to acknowledge that you were deceived, we were all deceived. It's okay to acknowledge that.   
Fans can even give you one of those supportive hugs and tell you: ""It's ok, it's everything alright, it's over. The 2D crew tricked you, and that's why the most loved series has died.""   
But please, put pride aside and we will bring you honor again.   
You continue to own the rights to the series, the prequels and sequels. Our Game of Thrones remains yours. It is in your hands! No one can do anything about it.   
Stop spending money on new filling holes series and pain healer series. And do what everyone else is still waiting for, even after all these months:   
Invest money again to hire 2 new executive producers, you can even put together a team of fan fiction writers and professional writers and get them to work on GRRM supervision... Even though George still has no clear idea of ​​what his latest books will look like, surely a team of 10 writers plus him could come to a good conclusion, to please the television's audience.   
Then, re-cast Peter, Lena, Emilia, Nikolaj, Iain Glen, Conleth and the others, since we can see that there were no major roles assigned to them for the time being and since GOT ended. On the other hand, Kit has a good project in hands, or even Maisie, but I think if you call them asking what they think, I think they would take some time for this “new” project. Of course, they would all ask you for some compensation for ""some"" problems from the past, but you can handle that. And after all this, do what is still in your hands, finish the Game of Thrones as it should be!   
I don't even want to talk about what the ending might be, but make a decent story, a worthy story building and credible characters with worthy speeches.   
You can even say that Bran had a bad dream and dreamt about all this, that the NK was immediately stoped at Winterfell, that Cersei died by a crumbling building, that Jaime was stabbed several times but somehow survived, so he can also die by a crumbling building and that Bronn became Master of Coin! It was just a nightmare.   
Overcome this and work on a new, credible story. If you want a new petition, we can give you. Not one just demanding that you do this, but one that can show you that you should do this under these premises. One that shows you our mercy, pity and sorrow.   
We forgive you for all these months that you put Us on hold.",7,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/e2y4em/its_time_hbo/,2019-11-28 16:37:39

469,e307pj,Season 8 Deleted Scenes and personal Summary,"Let me summarize which part of each scene was missing from actual episodes.

Scene #1 : Unsullied soldiers standing tall to Daeneryes and Jon while Northerners ignore and continue digging trenches. (Unsullied excuse to be lazy.)

Scene #2 : Couple pan shots of children eating stew before the war. Same guy in episode two with the addition of the ""How many years "" line. (I am not joking. This was the only part of the deleted scene but supposedly was important enough to be a deleted scene.)

Scene #3 Alys Karstark waltz in the godswood and gets ambushed by wights. (Had potential, executed very poorly.)

Scene #4 Gilly being a bad parent should have caused their demise but plot armor aura was so strong wights were deleted without Tyrion or Sansa making direct knife contact. Also little Sam is a ventriloquist.

Scene #5 [6:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05QeqNKZtK8&t=405s) Grey Worm doesn't like positive vibes so Daeneryes excuses him for the celebration.  [7:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05QeqNKZtK8&t=460s) Missandei wants to scissor Grey Worm so fakes feeling ill to be excused. (The acting here was so cringe it felt like it came from a cheap under budget porn.)

Let me remind you all that these were deemed important enough to be deleted due to time restrictions, (As if 6 episodes wasn't short enough as it is) but also relevant to the plot... somehow. I'd honestly love to see someone try to defend these scenes and tell me why the were significant to the overall plot.

In fact, the only way it is ever referenced is as an example of how something good can turn to shit. And yeah, we're months removed from the finale now, but this started happening within a month.

Honestly I can't think of any franchise that was so overwhelmingly popular one month, and then a month later almost evaporated. And it wasn't like GOT's popularity was a flash in the pan either, it was HUGE, and slowly built up over years, decades if you consider the books. Now, it feels like ancient history.

Did anyone else notice this?

There is no need for them to be on set anyway.
