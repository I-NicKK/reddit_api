* >!Luke and Leia knew all along Rey was Palpatine's granddaughter this is why Leia sends her to Luke, and this is why Luke does not want to train her. This whole revelation just retcons 2/3 of TLJ. Not only Rey is not NO ONE anymore, she is the related to the Devil basically. !<
* >!Palpatine is back ON THE FLESH, this pisses me off so hard because it basically negates Anakin's/Darth Vader's sacrifice on RoTJ. He spent all this time in some unknown planet building his fleet and army. (See the Troopers and Star Destroyers)!<
* >!Snoke is just some puppet of Palpatine, he has a collection of failed Snoke clones in a lab.!<
* >!Rey heavily struggles with the dark side the entire movie, she almost kills Chewie in one scene by accidentally using force lighting on a ship where he was at. !<
* >!Kylo gets beaten down by Rey in a fight (you can see it on the trailers, with the waves hitting a ship). While he is laying there almost dead, Han Solo comes back as a force ghost to tell him it is not too late to come back to the light side. Kylo then throws his lightsaber away and goes to help Rey.!<
* >!After beating Kylo, Rey is scared to use the force again, because she is losing control and tapping into the dark side. Rey goes back to Ach-to, where she is comforted by Luke. Luke then raises his X-Wing from the water (another retcon) so Rey can join her friends in fighting the First Order!<
* >!Rey goes to battle Palpatine and Kylo goes in to help Rey. Before, however, he fights all the Knights of Ren just using the force and his fists.!<
* >!Rey and Kylo fight Palpatine, but Palps uses them both to rejuvenate himself. He then throws Kylo off a cliff, never to be seen again.!<
* >!Rey is laying on the ground almost dying until she hears Leia, Luke and some other jedi voices. She rises and deflects Palpatine's lighting back at him. He dies.!<
* >!By the end of the movie, the heroes go back to Tattoine and some random guy asks Rey who she is. She says she is a Skywalker; The movie ends with the Twin Suns!<

Some random tidbits:

* >!Finn is related to Lando, the only other black guy on the entire galaxy (not a confirmed leak yet)!<
* >!Leia had a lightsaber that she gives it to Rey!<
* >!Rey forms a new double bladed lightsaber in the end of the movie with Luke and Leia's sabers. With an orange kyber crystal!<
* >!No Force Ghost Anakin, Qui-Gon or anything similar!<
* >!They use some music from the prequels, that's it!<

Anything else, ask directly.

1. C3P0 getting worked on by a small alien creature.

Both the small alien creature and a reference to 3P0 losing his memory (""Saying goodbye to my friends"") appear in the trailer.

2. Leia training Rey. These are the scenes we see in the trailer where she is jumping in a jungle. This is part of the training.

Agreed. But it sounds like the best movie in the trilogy.

I was expecting a train wreck and this is just garbage.","As a long-time Star Wars fan, my hopes for the sequels, if they ever occurred (even before the Lucas sale) were as follows:

* Thrawn adaptation
* See The Maw Installation
* Jedi Academy stuff (Major bonus points for Kyle Katarn)
* Remove all the cloning stuff

Every cloning plotline in the Expanded Universe has been a complete disaster. In general, the novels are free of it, but there are some sub-plots that deal with it. A lot of the worst stuff, especially the Palpatine cloning crap, comes from comics or the worse books that nobody likes.

It's absolutely mind-boggling that J.J. Abrams would be so out-of-touch that he would seemingly hand-pick the *worst* aspects of the Expanded Universe to adapt while throwing away (often outright making impossible) all the good bits. If you want a good Star Wars sequel film, do the exact opposite of what has been done. Do not remake the original. Do not ""subvert expectations"" with the next one. And don't bring anyone back or have them be related to each other, especially if cloning is involved.

The solution is easy: stop calling the Expanded Universe ""legends"" like Disney wants and just say anything Disney is non-canon. Everyone who isn't a Star Wars die-hard is going to move on and if the people who've been big fans forever keep the pressure on then their only choice to keep profiting will be to pander to the people who want the new movies to be non-canon and who want the EU back.",Was dog shit there too,This is not the Way.,That was the most ridiculous shit I've ever seen.

There is no “rise” of Skywalker when you just threw the last one off a cliff.,Yep and it makes my blood boil.,These leaks just seal the sequels' fate of being completely pointless if they turn out to be true.

Ed wakes up to the sound of swords clanging, gets outside to see the guards taking off and a bunch of dead Nights Watchmen all over the place. Then he sees a glow, the wagons are burning in the tunnel that leads north. Bam, the wildfire blows, blows the gate off the passage as well as a big chunk. And that's how the army of the dead get past the wall. They're frantically trying to fix the gate when all of a sudden theres a blizzard and 3 horns.

Most of the latest flops have been written within a year and the produced. A deep fantasy/sci-fi epic could seriously take years to develop just the world surrounding it. I think most of the studios are trying to have these writers crank these movies out like they are dramas. But, the wonderful thing about fantasy/sci-fi is that you don’t have the real world to lie back on. So, the pinnacle point of your story can involve certain aspects of the world that has been created. The new Star Wars movies are essentially just a classic drama film set inside a ‘wild’ universe. Same for s8 GOT where they basically left all the fantasy behind. It takes years and serious talent to be able to write fantasy/sci-Fi and it’s looking more and more like most writers in Hollywood don’t have the chops. You’d think the light would go off in Disney’s head that they could create a new behemoth of a series using a story and world that has had the careful touch of time and not one that is a drama re-purposed with ‘space people’ lol.","That last jihad was the worst of all Jihads, Finn may have a stopped a total Jihad, but instead she almost Jihaded herself.","You keep using that word, I don't think it means what you think it does.",Especially when they couldnt done a regular ram/detonation instead without shattering lore.,"Crystal skull?

All I remember is him getting nuked in a fridge and I just lost it right there. Also le boeuf? Lololol what a film.","Honestly, though all three of the mains in the new trilogy are lacking, Finn is the one that actually upsets me the most, because they seem to actively do him a disservice every time, it's like there's an active dislike for the character.

He has the same issue as Rey, where his backstory and setting don't match the character, but unlike her, it's to his total detriment. This is a man raised from childhood by the First Order to fight, taken from his parents at a young age solely for that job. He was picked by Captain Phasma to go with Kylo Ren on an important mission, that implies he has a level of skill or at least accolades under his belt.

Aaaand then he's basically reduced to a comic relief sidekick, his entire focus and goal as a character to help Rey with her destiny. He becomes, essentially, a plot device. He was touted as the first black main character in a Star Wars franchise, a Star Wars for the modern era... and that's the best they could do.

He should have been the driving force of the three main characters, the one with experience and the most training, the one who had the most pathos and conflict, and resolve. It's no wonder his actor is pissed, the character he was initially sold on was probably vastly different than the one he had to play.",Why did anybody need a remake?,"Solo was cool. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think most people who’ve seen it have as well.","Solo has like a got free folk/game of thrones sub thing going on where half of everyone had something to piss about and the other half loved the movie. I thought it was a good follow up to the side story world rogue one introduced and that it was really well done and cool, some of the acting was a bit odd and weird and some interactions either made no sense or ended up seeming forced and cringey. But overall I loved the movie and I think solo is for sure a good watch, even if it’s just to gain a better understanding of the universe as a whole. Since education is a good part of the movie, because I certainly learned things I never knew about.",Solo was surprisingly really good in my opinion. I really liked Rogue One and liked Solo more.,If the two things that have been salvaged from the Legends canon are Thrawn and *Palpatine Clones* that would be hilarious.,I agree. It all feels “pulled out of the ass” if you will,"Yes, but J.J doing this now further makes it shit, if you are doing stories that require building but you can't or don't have time, do something more simple. Palpatine being resurrected is too much for one film to really gnaw into.
What they should've done in my opinion is have Kylo lead the FO and the plot is basically how Rey helps his redemption arc, he comes back to the light side, and together they destroy Hux and the rest of the FO.
Basically one big redemption arc of a film.
It's simpler, and works better with what is there already.
There is no need to cram all this stuff into one film, it just ends up being half assed. Marvel had this problem as well in many films imo. Keep it simple and you can focus and make the events and characters feel more dignified and weighted.","Except that, when looking at the sequels as a whole, they make the original trilogy completely irrelevant. I can’t think of a single major plot point/accomplishment in the OT that isn’t rendered pointless by the sequels, if this is true.","The fact that I've read all of these spoilers make me actually want to see it now.

Roddenberry's vision was always a show exploring the merits of pacifism, morality, peace and goodwill in space.","For one thing, if it’s truly his last movie, I feel like it’d be a waste.  I much prefer to get absorbed into the worlds he creates, we have enough fucking franchise films, but Tarantino manages to get sizable budgets for original films.

*cough cough* **LANDO** *cough cough*","Two things could've fixed TFA for pretty much everyone IMO. 

1) Get rid of the Starkiller Base 

2) Get rid of the overwhelming power of the First Order (e.g., don't make them another Empire, make them a resurgence of the Empire that's threatening to retake control).  

Have the First Order be a rising threat that Finn and Rey have to help defeat. Kylo bests them in TFA, then TLJ Luke trains Rey/Finn how to succeed, and ROS is about Finn/Rey vanquishing the First Order. 

Suddenly it's not a knockoff of ANH.",Problem with solo is that after TLJ there was alot of SW hate and people stayed away from the movie. Atleast I know I did,Solo was much better than I expected it to be,"The clone palpatine bit was the thing I thought was preventing them from using legends, (since it's the dumbest part of the EU cannon).

Get rid of fucking Kathleen Kennedy and put someone in charge who cares for Star Wars.

TLJ basically said everything that happened in the Original Trilogy didn't matter. It said all the plot lines established in just the previous entry, didn't matter. The New Republic *kinda forgot* how to fight and just get conquered by the smaller First Order in a matter of hours. 

Like genuinely, TLJ makes it so that everything that happened in episodes 1 through 7 *doesn't matter*. At all. It makes no sense in any meaningful way. The plot is nonsensical and contrived, the characters are inconsistent to all hell. Just the simple choreography / structure is so bad that characters are genuinely *teleporting* all over the place for the movie to 'work' and 'move forward'. (E.g. how Phasma was about to execute Rose and Finn from like 3 feet away, explosion happens, Finn comes to and Phasma who was apparently teleported out walks in from clear the other side of the ship in pristine armor.)(or how Rose pulled back and accelerated away from Finn, Finn went full speed ahead, in the same vehicle, then Rose somehow teleports in front of Finn in order to crash into him after she realized he wasn't following)(or how weapons were CGI'd out half way through the fight scene with the Sith Guards so it would make sense to why Mary Sue doesn't get chopped in half).

I could go on and on but suffice to say TLJ lacks in every department. At least TFA set up a different big picture, of a strong but off balance New Republic vs a smaller but prepared First Order.

>Cliché conflict between Poe and the Admiral that could have been solved with a conversation.

Leia tried having that conversation with Poe and he ignored her, so she demoted him.

>Slow moving  bombers that drop bombs like some weird early ww2 bomber.

It's only slow relatively and it's visually cool.

>Rose saving Finn because reasons. I guess she just wanted them all to die?

Poe's a pilot, Rose is an engineer, Finn's an ex-storm trooper.

Basically what RJ accomplished in The Last Jedi was to systematically shoot down every interesting plot thread from The Force Awakens and left nothing for fans to go off of between ep 8 and 9. You can tell they felt the need to fix RJ’s mistakes by bringing back Palpatine, obviously killing off Snoke left them with no viable main villain (Kylo Ren is conflicted, but not really main villain material).

You can tell in the hype levels going into ep 9, which is out this month, yet it feels like it’s a year away because of how little attention it’s getting. The run-up to both eps 7 and 8 were big, fans were theorizing left and right about every aspect of the movies, yet all that seems pretty muted now.

One of the reasons I don’t take TLJ salt too seriously is that so many people seem to be grasping at any random complaint they can grab hold of, even if it doesn’t make any sense. It shows an underlying emotionality. It suggests you don’t actually know what you’re really upset about. Probably just the standard ones- you don’t find it satisfying that Rey’s parents were no one, that Snoke wasn’t important, that Luke was a bitter asshole. But it’s harder to attack those from a storytelling perspective so just grab at something random that’s pissing you off even if you don’t know why.

Nuclear subs are weapons, with an actual nuclear arsenal usually, with a radioactive reactor too.

This is the same argument I hear from people defending GoT S8. That plot point COULD have been good, it COULD have been interesting, but it wasn't. The problem with it is Luke's motivation. Why does Luke believe the Jedi need to die? That's the entire reason why he thought about killing Kylo and why he went into exile, so what's the answer? There isn't one. At least not one set up in the movie. All we see in the film is Luke saying he saw Snoke luring Kylo in and then got scared. We don't see why Luke is afraid of Snoke, how the Jedi teachings failed him, or how Luke became a pessimistic coward. We don't follow that plot point because it makes no sense from the last time we saw Luke. This is the reason Mark Hamill has stated he couldn't view his character as Luke, and instead had to see him as Jake Skywalker.

Because it was a copy/paste of Star Wars.

TFA, with no real explanation, thrusts us back into a rebels vs empire dynamic without giving us grounding to understand why that is or what this conflict is about, how it started, why the First Order is so powerful, what the ""Resistance""'s relationship is to the Republic, etc., etc..

It then establishes a bunch of mystery boxes- Who are Rey's Parents? Who is this Snoke? Why was Luke hiding?

And as far as I've been able to tell Abrams had no actual plans for resolving any of these dangling questions.

This created an impossible ask for any sequel; resolve these unresolved mysteries in a way that satisfies all fans in the midst of a story and setting that lacks any cohesion and that banks on nostalgia by basically invalidating the plot of the original trilogy.

Up to and now including apparently just bringing back the Emperor. 

Like the clearest example I think is with Luke. So many fans are pissed off that Luke is a bitter old hermit in this story, going to a backwoods planet to die.

That's not our Luke! Our Luke is a hero!

The problem is, besides this literally being what both of his mentors did, that literally any other explanation for why Luke hid himself on a remote planet and tried to avoid being found is going to be far worse.

Like Luke is a much, *much* bigger asshole if he thinks he'd be useful to the Resistance and then ran away anyway. The only good reason for him to be hiding is because he thinks he's not capable of helping, that he's a fuckup. 

Luke's disappearance in TFA is presented as a big mystery box into which fans can pour half-formed speculation, but it becomes obvious with a moment of thought that there was only one real possibility that had any narrative significance. 

And frankly I think the fans that don't see this stuff lack an understanding of story structure at a basic level.

I'm reminded of how when I used to hang around this sub back in season 5-6, hell, even in 7, and I would point out why the story was falling apart I would get downvoted and told to fuck off because people didn't want to hear it. They applauded D&D the entire time they were knocking out the support beams, and then acted shocked and outraged when the roof collapsed on their heads.","I have never been impressed with any attempt I've seen to draw parallels between GoT S8 and TLJ, and I'm not impressed with this one. 

The first and most obvious problem with your argument:

*Luke is not the fucking protagonist.*

Daenerys was the co-protagonist with Jon Snow of the entire fucking series. Literally she was the most central pillar of the entire story- a good 1/3 or more of the plot even early on was just dedicated to her rise to power, even when disconnected from everything else on an entirely separate continent. By the end, her military campaign *was* the story, especially after they unceremoniously ended Winter early. 

Understanding the logic and motivation and trajectory of Dany's descent into pure villainry is really fucking important.

Understanding Luke's isn't because in the new trilogy, *Luke isn't the fucking protagonist.* He's not even close to one. He, like Leia and Han, get relegated to background roles. He's not Dany, he's Jorah or Barristan. And like let's take the latter, who did get shabbily treated by D&D- but Barristan being offed was very clearly not even in the same scale of fuckup as what they did to Dany.

While the series in general needs a lot more establishment of setting and background and what happened in between the OT and the Sequels, and that lack is a detriment to the story, we don't need a point-by-point account of Luke's attempts to train the new generation of Jedi, a full account of his failure, and to witness him struggle and fail to come to terms with it. In fact, it would be straight up bad storytelling to spend that much time on Luke. I do love Mark Hamil but I feel like he may legitimately have lost track of the fact that Luke stopped being the protagonist in the new trilogy, and is no longer the center of either the actions or themes of the new story. 

I think him becoming a bitter cynic who no longer believes in the Jedi religion is perfectly sensible but there's no need to cover that descent in detail because that's not his role in the story anymore. His role is to pass on what he's learned to the new generation of hero, to become filled with a new hope at their determination, cast off his bitterness, and then sacrifice himself to advance the cause while passing on the torch to the next generation.

Like this is even,  unlike some of the other stuff, actually just fucking bog-standard storytelling trope stuff. ""Young scrappy hero wants to be trained by old master, master doesn't want to train them and thinks it's pointless, scrappy hero perseveres, gets training, rekindles the old master's belief in the cause, old master dies saving the hero or setting up their victory"" is just like.

Had GRRM been hit by a bus the day after they the first season premiered, would it still be his fault? They bought a work unfinished which is always a foolish venture. 

Hell, HBO could have bought the rights and waited until all the books were out even to start. They had no rules to follow. GRRM was never contractually obligated with HBO to complete the books in any timeframe, so how is it his fault for being slow? ADWD was already famously delayed when they got into the game. Even another delay of that length would mean there is no book 7 for the end of the show.

When you agree to be a showrunner you become the CEO of the show. Part of the job is that the blame falls to you if everything implodes. D&D agreed to that responsibility in 2010 or so and GRRM never did.

Going to heavy disagree here. TFA, in the small picture, does recreate Rebels vs Empire. But it is very explicit that the New Republic is the power in the galaxy, the First Order is on the fringes of the galaxy outside New Republic control, that the Resistance is a local group fighting the First Order in that section of the galaxy, and that the New Republic is funding / helping the Resistance by proxy. 

The First Order is explicitly *not* all powerful. It is a regional power in that section of the galaxy. 

So while its basically ANH 2.0 on the small picture which we mostly see, the bigger universe is *vastly* different than ANH had. That is until TLJ was like ""lol jk for no reason whatsoever First Order controls the galaxy"".

> It then establishes a bunch of mystery boxes- Who are Rey's Parents? Who is this Snoke? Why was Luke hiding?

Are we just calling all foreshadowing / mysteries 'mystery boxes' now?

> This created an impossible ask for any sequel; resolve these unresolved mysteries in a way that satisfies all fans in the midst of a story and setting that lacks any cohesion and that banks on nostalgia by basically invalidating the plot of the original trilogy.

Not remotely. One, the middle film doesn't need to solve all of them. Two, Rian Johnson very much intentionally chose the *least* satisfying answers, and often times the answers that canonically *make no sense*, because he thinks a 'good' film can be measured in how upset you make the audience. He thinks purposefully giving unsatisfying answers is how you 'subvert' the audience's expectations, and he also thinks subversion for the sake of subversion is a good plot device. Its genuinely 100% terrible.

Just off the top of my head, Rey's parentage didn't really matter. It wasn't as emphasized as everyone tries to make it seem it was in TFA. Its there but overall unimportant, and any answer will do (although the delivery in TLJ seems very deliberate in a 'fuck anything that could happen there' category, although funnily if the leaks are true...). The actual mystery is how Rey is so talented in the Force (which had a possibility of being answered by parentage), because there were many hints that this was a plot thread. Kylo seemed overly upset for just a 'random girl', it seemed like he knew something. But TLJ didn't resolve any of that, it just made it worse by giving her more power for no reason.

Snoke / First Order in general could use more expansion, at the moment all we have about them is that they are space nazis and want to rule the galaxy. When you come form the OT to the sequels, that kind of difference could use an explanation.

Luke hiding is hinted at being related to the destruction of his academy in TFA. There are many ways to resolve this without destroying Luke / his whole character arc in the OT. I dig Luke feeling he failed to such a degree that he goes into exile. That's fine. But *how* he failed is important. Luke attempting to murder his nephew for kinda thinking he might go dark side one day is a terrible reason when the whole OT ended with him believing in a father he barely knew to be good. Its nonsensical. Have Luke go out for milk or something and come back to his academy destroyed by Snoke (who also kidnaps some of them for the Knights of Ren / his guards / Kylo), it helps expand on how Snoke came to power and it gives Luke a legitimate reason to go super depressed in a corner of the galaxy. Genuinely isn't that hard to spend 5 seconds coming up with better answers than Rian Johnson did (because, again, Rian Johnson *explicitly* aims for the *least satisfying* conclusion to any given scene/ plot thread because he thinks that's good storytelling lol).

> The problem is, besides this literally being what both of his mentors did, that literally any other explanation for why Luke hid himself on a remote planet and tried to avoid being found is going to be far worse.

Not at all. I already gave one half ass reason that's already 100 times better than ""luke tried to murder his sleeping defenseless nephew"". There are so many more. Maybe Luke was *too* nice and didn't stop Kylo, who then accidentally lops off someone's arm, which prompts to him kicking Kylo out of the academy and then Kylo joining Snoke and destroying Luke's Academy in vengeance. Maybe Luke ended up in a situation where he had to fight Snoke / First Order (or maybe just some wild animals) with some students and lost some of them, say Kylo's GF and Kylo blames him for it, resulting in him being bitter and defecting to Snoke etc etc. 

It genuinely isn't hard to come up with more believable and true to character ways for Luke to get depressed and feel he failed, and to seek guidance at the original temple.

Like, if you're saying Luke being a hermit is one of the best ways for the plot, then I agree. I just vehemently disagree on the why, and it is a very important why. Also I feel there are other legitimate reasons for a non depressed Luke to not interfere with current conflicts. But I think being depressed has better narrative qualities and would allow the new characters to shine as opposed to just sitting back and let Luke take care of everything (even though I wouldn't be against that either)",">Understanding Luke isn't in the new trilogy because Luke isn't the fucking protagonist

This is the worst argument I have ever seen for destroying a character. You know what using that logic Lando wasn't the protagonist in Solo so it would be perfectly acceptable to you to make that character a giant spider that shoots icecream and never explain it because it doesn't matter because Lando isn't the protagonist?

>We don't need a point-by-pount account of Luke's attempts to train the new generation of Jedi, a full account of his failure, and to witness him struggle and fail to come to terms with it

You know what that sounds like? A legitimately interesting movie. But regardless you are right, we don't need 2 hours of a 2 and a half hour movie to establish any of that. You know what we need? One damn scene, like maximum of 5 minutes, showing Luke training and failing Kylo. We do not need everything to be spelled out, but we do need it there because then Luke's character makes sense. You're defending lazy writing by taking criticisms other people have and exploding them out of proportion, when the actual solution is stupendously simpler. Actually here's the exact spot they could have had it. You remember when Luke is talking to Rey about almost killing Kylo? And they have those flashback shots of Luke almost killing Kylo? Yeah like during that, kind of at the beginning of the speech, Luke could have been like ""I was a bad teacher"" and then shots of Kylo yelling at Luke, getting angry, and Luke checking the sacred texts and nothing changing. You know quick shots, real quick, so that we get the information that Luke tried the Jedi way, and the Jedi way failed. Simple, fast, slots into the movie perfectly. We don't need everything spelled out, we just need it to exist.

Now. I'm sorry. Luke Skywalker. One of the most IMPORTANT people in the entire history of this civilization and you think we don't need to understand him? We don't need to understand why the character who ended the tyranny of the empire, re established the galactic Senate, and re established the deceased Jedi order, decided to say fuck the Jedi? Are you being serious right now? Do you even like star wars?","Its the Skywalker saga though.

But even on the smaller scale picture of just the Sequel Trilogy, its doing disservice to the former main character. It makes absolutely no sense from where we last off.

Martin was the single point of failure.  This all stems from people not wanting to insult Martin simply because, as Gaiman put it, he’s “not our bitch”.

In addition, if Martin cared about his work, he would have never sold it until it was finished.  His love for TV and ego drove him to it.  Robert Jordan is as good, if not better, as Martin and he wrote 4 million words in the time has taken Martin to write 422,000, and Jordan was dying for 800,000 of those words.

That good enough for you,  kneeler?",No problem.,"You're missing the point.

Contractually it was out of GRRMs control and that was HBOs choice. GRRM did not create the show or dictate how it would go. If he is guilty of letting anyone down it is book readers and not show watchers. 

I just don't get where this defense comes from. It doesnt matter what other writers did or how many words he wrote or what he told them in a non-legally binding way, the show was the responsibility of HBO and the profits stood to benefit its shareholders, not GRRM.

You can disagree I guess but how does that assign all the blame to a guy who wasn't in the writers room? Someone who had no say in casting or writing or how long seasons would be or the number of those seasons.

If book 3 took 2 seasons, then 4/5 should have taken three at least, which means if D&D had not accelerated things the end of season 7 would have been Jons death. They cut out stuff like stoneheart and faegon without knowing how integral those plots would be to the endgame. Even with his material they made huge changes and never ever thought about what they were adding up to. What good would TWOW have been to them if those two plots and stuff like northern politics and the faceless men messing with the citadel dictated how things went? All that was cut when they had material to work with.

Blaming GRRM full stop only makes sense if you dont look at the full picture. It was never his job or obligation to do anything for the show, the info he shared he did out of the kindess of his heart. And if your business relies on the favors of others to work then you have a bad business.

The show failed because D&D failed and for no other reason",That’s a fair point.,Why not?,"I mean the same question still applies. If this is a feasible tactic, then it should be done all the time, *especially* vs like the Death Star or say a Trade Blockade, because then they would be stationary targets and such a calculation would be easier to hit.

The contract doesn’t even exist without Martin.  It has nothing to do with the terms of contract if Martin doesn’t sign it.  I get that he didn’t have to collaborate w the show.  I understand that they could have put dogs taking shits for the finale.  However, Martin had one job through this, and that was to finish the books.  Something he fucking failed miserably at and to pretend that this didn’t have a profound Impact on the show is disingenuous. 

They stayed true and likely stayed true all the way through the end.  If that is fact, then the failure lies in Martin.  I’d rather have this ending then a creative license ending that they made up.

It was D&Ds job to adapt, not create.  You can’t adapt what isn’t there.","JJ threw away the trilogy plan and wrote a single episode with a bunch of plot threads he never thought about tying together.

Of course his lack of a book effected the show but the second they signed that contract and took control from GRRM, D&D took responsibility. From the first minute they started doing this there was a chance the books arent there for them. A sizable chance from the start. How are they blameless for not preparing at all for this outcome? It was always on the table. 

Youre like a farmer blaming too much rain on a crop failure when the field you worked was known to be in a floodplain. 

They signed up for a deal that entailed them having no command over GRRM AND them shouldering the burden to create a good show. GRRM didnt make anyone do anything, D&D read the books and decided to take a risk. It doesnt matter how much of a mitigating circumstance GRRM was, he was at most only a mitigating circumstance.","This is pissed me off a whole lot at the time..

These were incredibly expensive. At the height of their power, Athens, Carthege, and Rome never had more than 400 of these at the same time.

Therefore, to complete those ships even within a year (let alone more quickly) would require 16,400 workers skilled in ship building. It would also require an enormous number of large, mature trees.

As for the fleet, Pyke is described as barren in the books as well, but it’s the Iron IslandS, with an S. There are trees elsewhere, and more to be stolen from the mainland shore.

It wasn’t and the rest is history,"When you have built up enough trust with your audience, they will forgive errors later because they will expect those errors to result in some future consequence in the story: that's what stories are.

The problem is, beginning in season 5, those errors start accumulating - and Game of Thrones had built up so much goodwill with the audience that they were ready to forgive a lot. Until you get to the final season, where we only have 6 episodes to bring consequences to 4 error-filled seasons.

That's why Season 8 was so highly anticipated, it had SO MUCH to accomplish to remedy issues going back to season 5/6/7, not to mention where the story arcs left off in season 4, and the overall arc of white walkers and Dany's invasion of Westeros.

That's why when they were like, ""We're only going to do 6 episodes, but they're going to be movie length"" it actually sounded good, like they understood how much remained - people expected LOTR + Hobbit trilogies, or the Harry Potter Saga, to wrap everything up.

So when we got some of the worst writing ever put on television, it was an unfathomable fall from audience expectations.

If the government owns the brothels, then this ensures that some of the coin the workers receive will eventually find its way back to the government.","> Yara and theon took all the ships available with them.

Not quite.

The Iron Islands can muster 500 ships overall. The core of this is the Iron Fleet, which is personally owned and maintained by House Greyjoy, and consists of 100 ships, all of them big tough war galleys. The remaining 400 (which are *not* part of the Iron Fleet) come from House Greyjoy's vassals, and are your standard viking longships, which are good for launching swift naval raids, but not so good against galleys (what everyone else uses) in direct naval combat.

Yara and Theon somehow stole the entire Iron Fleet.

Now, it makes sense that most of the Iron Fleet would be loyal to her, since Victarion Greyjoy (the Iron Fleet's commander in the books) doesn't exist in the show so presumably Yara fulfilled that role (and indeed, Victarion is the one who travels to meet Dany in the books.)

Additionally they could get thralls(slaves) to do the mining for them. They built a lifestyle that required constant raiding and warfare. They became a sort of half-viking half-spartan society, with the men becoming more and more focused on being raiders and capturing slaves to do the work supporting the raiding and collecting tributes.

GOD FUCKING DAMMIT FUCK D&D.","I’ve thought this before too, and it would have helped everything flow so much better. 

-Dany’s depression isn’t simply that her dragon died and now she’s really really sad. Instead she blames Varys and Tyrion for not knowing anything about the existence of these horns, and she blames Jon for not riding Rhaegal, which she thinks could have maybe saved him somehow. 

-Maybe dragon horn made Rhaegal go crazy and Dany/Drogon had to kill him themselves. This would be even more devastating, and she’d REALLY blame Jon. Plus it would make more sense for Euron to sneak off during this time rather than whatever happened on the show. 

-The next episode starts out similarly to the show, except Euron isn’t in the middle of the battle. After the Lannister army basically gives up, instead of Dany waiting for the bells to make her go crazy, she hears that horn again. She’s trying to figure out where the sound is coming from, and starts to get worried when Drogon is acting up again. 

So rather than wait to see how Drogon responds to the horn, she starts attacking the entire city until she can stop the horn. And then in the process, even after the horn stops, she keeps going and burns the rest of the city. 

And then afterwards she tells Jon this proves that she was right, and that if Jon had just ridden with Rhaegal earlier, Euron and the horn could have been beaten right away, and thus it’s his fault that she had to burn the whole city down. 


And then for fun, Bran reveals he saw a vision of Euron finding the horn in Valyria, but purposely didn’t tell anyone.","The horn will likely be obtained by faegon in the books in order for him to become a dragonrider...thus evening the playing field.

In the books it is suspected, but Euron never openly admits to it, and supports the official story: that Balon was blown off the bridge by a strong gust of wind. I might be misremembering, but I'm pretty sure there's even a scene in the books where he tells Yara (known as Asha in the books) that if Balon's death *wasn't* an accident, he will find and punish whoever was responsible. She continues to insist that it was him, so instead he asks one of his allies a bunch of questions like: ""Do I control the winds?"", to which his ally is like: ""Nah.""

In the show Euron outright says: ""I killed him, I should have done it years ago, and we're all better off because of it.""

> all the Iron Islanders just kinda figured that was the way of things.

It isn't.

Kinslaying, even on the Iron Islands, is extremely taboo. It is believed that doing so leaves you cursed in the eyes of gods and men. There are cases of Ironborn killing brothers, uncles, or nephews over the throne in the past, but more often than not those people are looked back on with disdain or hatred. 

In the books, Euron has two more brothers - Victarion and Aeron. Balon, Victarion, and Aeron *all* wanted Euron dead, but didn't go through with it, because all three of them believed in the kinslaying taboo, so Balon exiled him instead.","He absolutely is but so is the entire greyjoy family. And we currently have no idea what of what he's said is actually true or not. He came in, claimed a bunch of magical cool shit, and then book ends as he heads off to find Dany, not Cersei!

Yeah. I don't know if you read the books, but Euron's ascension was a lot more complicated there. He was able to get the lords of Pyke on his side through a bit of blackmail and intimidation, but the rest of the Islands were against him. The Drowned Men wanted to crown Aeron, Harlaw and Blacktyde wanted to crown Asha, and everyone else wanted to crown Victarion.

The only reason the Iron Islands weren't engulfed by a brutal civil war was because Aeron had called a Kingsmoot to keep the succession peaceful.

Whereas in the show he just saw a nice ass and thought ""to hell with the Freys""",Then he knocks up this girl and feels obligated to marry her because he doesn’t want his kid to be a bastard like Jon. He saw how horribly his mother treated Jon and didn’t want that for his own child. It’s Catelyn’s fault. Snobby bitch.

And the same hypocrites will worship Stannis who literally let his bastard orphan nephew, who came to him with high Hope's, be tortured and would have let him burn. But totally not misogynist you guys","I didnt even know I could do that..
Thank you!! Ima look up how and get my boy Ned tf outta Kings Landing",Skill shot is to hit something with a catapult when it was just fired from a trebuchet.,"I believe in the books its revealed to us after the fact that her mother had been secretly giving her medicine to induce a miscarriage, while working with the Lannisters.",The Lannisters send their regards.,In the book they say that they tried a lot for a child. Like naming one bed and stuff amount of trying. Was not till after that they started to bang,"The problem with Cat is that George set her up to be hated.  All of her good ideas are ignored and all her bad ones are carried out.  The issue with saying that it was a one off is that the one incident is the only example we as readers.  For Stannis, ya.  The whole point is that he was being led by the witch down a path of evil and eventually rejected it to do his duty as king.","Oh for the love of the sevens, quit reaching so hard, you'll dislocate your arm.",True skill is firing multiple catapults from one Trebuchet while said trebuchet is garrisoning inside a siege ram.,This isn't the time Roose,"I do believe many of her so called bad decisions are deliberately taken out of context by people online. Like she only captured Tyrion after he had recognized her (GRRM makes it a point to specially mention this and so does the show) where she had no choice as Tyrion would run to warn Cersei which would still mean Ned being captured and Robert killed.

She is blamed for starting the war but her capturing Tyrion did not start the war as Ned would have still found out the secret, still confessed to Cersei who would have killed Robert and captured Ned anyways

She is blamed for Ned accepting the hand's position but if she had not convinced Ned to accept the hand's position Ned would have made an enemy of the king, no way Robert travels a million miles over months and takes no for an answer, not with Cersei constantly reminding her about it

She is blamed for making Ned trust littlefinger, when littlefinger has fooled every single person including Tywin and Tyrion and would have taken in Ned anyways

So on and so forth. Everything deliberately taken out of context to malign her. Plus add people like u/Myfourcats1 blatantly making up lies which happens neither in the book nor show yet is constantly upvoted on this sub. Cat hate is a online circlejerk with roots in misogyny",The post i replied to by u/Myfourcats1 is a blatant lie and does not happen in either the book or the show. Yet it has 51 upvotes. QED,"Do you really think it's misogyny, or do you want to think about it for more than 3 seconds. She was a dick to one of the most well liked characters in the series. That's why she's so hated. Same way anyone that's a dick to Daenerys is disliked. Calling it misogyny is a cop out to not have to think at all.","Many of Cat's mistakes can be chalked up to her operating as if the feudal system that she was raised to navigate is still functioning at a time when it is collapsing.  I'm not going to say that misogamy isn't a large part, but I'd say a lot of it is just that the incident with Jon that starts us off and colors everything after, he is our protagonist after all, strikes a cord because it is relatable.  A lot of folks have or care about people that have experiences with step parents that treat kids poorly.  (I know that their relationship is more complicated than that but that is the closest real world analogue I can think of and it is one that I know some people have connected to emotionally.)  The characters that really infuriate people are the ones that are relatable like that.  To use a par of villainous examples, Reagal from Farseer and Umbridge from Harry Potter.","It was WRONG, not a lie, don't attribute to malice what can be attributed to ignorance. There was no misogyny there. Also, the OP is images from the show, where Cat very obviously hated John, and didn't just say something out of despair; remember she didnt even want him at the feast in winterfell, or to greet Bobby B? Granted he/she was still wrong and it's not what happened but you're acting like he/she said some horrible anti-woman mantra, when he/she just hates a character in a book/tv series, and then you're attempting to paint a whole sub of people as something awful because of it. Just stop looking for something that's not there so you can feel like youre valiantly fighting some horrid giant machination, when it isn't that deep and he/she just dislikes a character from a work of fiction. Dear gods, that's literally all I'm asking. Just get over yourself.","Oh God, I hate how they try to make house stark like the ""protagonists"" and ""heroes"", it shouldn't be like that",Making the eight.,For House Lannister.,"They mean House Lannister.

Baby yoda doesn’t have to be used for *everything*,Were you wearing those daisy dukes while boaring?,"It was an accident on the part of Wilfred my boar, he just gets so excited that the loving head rubs and snouty bumps can become dangerous and I didn't move away fast enough. I was chuffed when the doctor knew what I meant when I said I got a Robert Baratheon. I was sad when he said he was only up to season 7...",Nice stubbies mate,Did you tell the nurses to give you something for the pain and let you die??,You couldn't just kick that pig in the face? Or maybe stomp on it as it approached?,"No, I chucked them on cause they were the only pants that wouldn't rub on or near the big gaping hole on my leg. Didn't bother changing my gumboots cause I didn't want to bleed on my shoes. But in future I think I will be getting some chainsaw pants!!!",This is solid r/HFY material for the idea that humans have a crazy love for dangerous beasts that would scare peaceful aliens.,"It was a friendly exchange, a big head rub hello but his tusk snagged my leg and rip. Once that happened I put a feed barrel in between us so he didn't try to rub the leg again and pull the wound open further.  

If I had kicked or stomped him I imagine I would have told him I wanted to fight and I would have a 200kg boar with a head like a rock and armour plating along his shoulders throwing his whole body at me and then purposefully biting me into little pieces.",If you got it flaunt it,"If you mean Chainsaw stopper pants those might not do the trick. They work by having tons of threads that tear off and gum up the chainsaw gears thereby stopping the chainsaw, so they’re not designed for a single penetrating object like a tusk. Might wanna look into some heavy leather chaps instead. [ video of chainsaw pants in action 
](https://youtu.be/r5VSivQe760)",Good thing you went with the feed barrel approach then,Or you could have prepared for the event and brought a weapon. Instead of being a literal Robert Baratheon. Just sayin.,"Awwww no, I did read pig hunters wear them, but I don't want to spend the money on them if I am just going to end up with another boar kiss despite them. 

This is the first time I have had this issue, normally his tusks don't make contact cause he gives me a rub and then is too busy flopping over for a belly scratch. But I would be stupid not to find something to ensure it doesn't happen again. Might need to research some more."

By the end, her military campaign *was* the story, especially after they unceremoniously ended Winter early. \n\nUnderstanding the logic and motivation and trajectory of Dany\'s descent into pure villainry is really fucking important.\n\nUnderstanding Luke\'s isn\'t because in the new trilogy, *Luke isn\'t the fucking protagonist.* He\'s not even close to one. He, like Leia and Han, get relegated to background roles. He\'s not Dany, he\'s Jorah or Barristan.

TFA, in the small picture, does recreate Rebels vs Empire. But it is very explicit that the New Republic is the power in the galaxy, the First Order is on the fringes of the galaxy outside New Republic control, that the Resistance is a local group fighting the First Order in that section of the galaxy, and that the New Republic is funding / helping the Resistance by proxy. \n\nThe First Order is explicitly *not* all powerful. It is a regional power in that section of the galaxy. \n\nSo while its basically ANH 2.0 on the small picture which we mostly see, the bigger universe is *vastly* different than ANH had. That is until TLJ was like ""lol jk for no reason whatsoever First Order controls the galaxy"".\n\n> It then establishes a bunch of mystery boxes- Who are Rey\'s Parents? Who is this Snoke?

One, the middle film doesn\'t need to solve all of them. Two, Rian Johnson very much intentionally chose the *least* satisfying answers, and often times the answers that canonically *make no sense*, because he thinks a \'good\' film can be measured in how upset you make the audience. He thinks purposefully giving unsatisfying answers is how you \'subvert\' the audience\'s expectations, and he also thinks subversion for the sake of subversion is a good plot device. Its genuinely 100% terrible.\n\nJust off the top of my head, Rey\'s parentage didn\'t really matter. It wasn\'t as emphasized as everyone tries to make it seem it was in TFA. Its there but overall unimportant, and any answer will do (although the delivery in TLJ seems very deliberate in a \'fuck anything that could happen there\' category, although funnily if the leaks are true...). The actual mystery is how Rey is so talented in the Force (which had a possibility of being answered by parentage), because there were many hints that this was a plot thread. Kylo seemed overly upset for just a \'random girl\', it seemed like he knew something. But TLJ didn\'t resolve any of that, it just made it worse by giving her more power for no reason.\n\nSnoke / First Order in general could use more expansion, at the moment all we have about them is that they are space nazis and want to rule the galaxy. When you come form the OT to the sequels, that kind of difference could use an explanation.\n\nLuke hiding is hinted at being related to the destruction of his academy in TFA. There are many ways to resolve this without destroying Luke / his whole character arc in the OT. I dig Luke feeling he failed to such a degree that he goes into exile. That\'s fine. But *how* he failed is important. Luke attempting to murder his nephew for kinda thinking he might go dark side one day is a terrible reason when the whole OT ended with him believing in a father he barely knew to be good. Its nonsensical. Have Luke go out for milk or something and come back to his academy destroyed by Snoke (who also kidnaps some of them for the Knights of Ren / his guards / Kylo), it helps expand on how Snoke came to power and it gives Luke a legitimate reason to go super depressed in a corner of the galaxy. Genuinely isn\'t that hard to spend 5 seconds coming up with better answers than Rian Johnson did (because, again, Rian Johnson *explicitly* aims for the *least satisfying* conclusion to any given scene/ plot thread because he thinks that\'s good storytelling lol).\n\n> The problem is, besides this literally being what both of his mentors did, that literally any other explanation for why Luke hid himself on a remote planet and tried to avoid being found is going to be far worse.\n\nNot at all. I already gave one half ass reason that\'s already 100 times better than ""luke tried to murder his sleeping defenseless nephew"". There are so many more. Maybe Luke was *too* nice and didn\'t stop Kylo, who then accidentally lops off someone\'s arm, which prompts to him kicking Kylo out of the academy and then Kylo joining Snoke and destroying Luke\'s Academy in vengeance. Maybe Luke ended up in a situation where he had to fight Snoke / First Order (or maybe just some wild animals) with some students and lost some of them, say Kylo\'s GF and Kylo blames him for it, resulting in him being bitter and defecting to Snoke etc etc. \n\nIt genuinely isn\'t hard to come up with more believable and true to character ways for Luke to get depressed and feel he failed, and to seek guidance at the original temple.\n\nLike, if you\'re saying Luke being a hermit is one of the best ways for the plot, then I agree. I just vehemently disagree on the why, and it is a very important why. Also I feel there are other legitimate reasons for a non depressed Luke to not interfere with current conflicts. But I think being depressed has better narrative qualities and would allow the new characters to shine as opposed to just sitting back and let Luke take care of everything (even though I wouldn\'t be against that either)']}","{'f9hmzuf': [3, '>Understanding Luke isn\'t in the new trilogy because Luke isn\'t the fucking protagonist\n\nThis is the worst argument I have ever seen for destroying a character.
