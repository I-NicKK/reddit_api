2,bladdh,The blatant and unapologetic misogyny of ep 804.,"It's extremely disheartening how much the show has taken a nosedive. The show has abandoned everything it was about and it's heart to believe G.R.R.M has any ties to what's unfolding here. In particular, the misogynist undertones were utterly horrendous.

We have Brienne, a stellar female character in her own right, reduced to a helpless, sobbing heap, crying after her prince charming as he rides off into who-knows-where (yeah, that trope totally hasn't been done 18174 times before D&D...), and then we also have Sansa and Arya, who, against all common sense logic, are determined to play the role of catty sisters-in-law to its bitter end. It couldn't be more evident that a woman didn't have anything to do with writing the script the season. No other way to say this, but honestly who else but men enjoys pitting female characters against each other for the most inexplicable of reasons lol. 

They took Sansa (someone who as a rape survivor has endured more than Jon/Dany/Arya ever have), built her up to be an intelligent and hardened character who knows how to draw lessons from the hardships life threw at her, and then butcher her character into this petty little person that seemingly wants nothing more than to make harder the life of another fellow woman (the female lead, no less). Absolutely ghastly. 

Then they have Daenerys of course sitting through all the setbacks she's been dealt over the course of this episode - all of which were rushed and half-assed just so they can quickly establish their mad queen narrative within the next 2 episodes. Because you know, women can't think rationally enough to be leaders (as Varys was kind enough to point out, cocks are important), and even a strong lead like Dany who spent 7 seasons looking out for the most vulnerable and other fellow women isn't immune to the disease of irrationality that's exclusive to the double X-chromosome bearers. And after this 70 minutes of steaming misogynistic drivel, let's have ourselves an execution where we sprinkle in some gratuitous violence against women, because why not. And let's make the focus of Missandei's death be about Grey Worm's reaction, because naturally Missandei's primary value was in how much a man valued her.

I don't have the slightest doubt this comment will be downvoted by empathy-lacking basement dwellers, but I needed to vent this somewhere lol.

8,d4ao00,Transparency Report: How to fuck shit up and ruin a subreddit in two days,"There is a long history of trolling in this subreddit and one of the reasons we rapidly grew from a small subreddit.  We have very loose moderation rules, and very loose mod rules, which  has generally worked out in the past.  Mods could take unilateral action, joke with users, sticky random things, and do their own events.  But the larger the subreddit gets, when you make a mistake or bad joke, the consequences and fallout are amplified.

Backdrop/Overview

This entire debacle started with an idea for having a Lotr memes event that swiftly became a  “Positivity” thread/event.  There was no hard commitment to it but mods were privately suggesting ideas like how long it should be (kept within a thread, day, week, etc) and what should go along with it (changing Automod rules, troll announcements, if we announce, etc)  Some mods went ahead unilaterally with it made a “Positivity Week” thread and changed the Automod to remove (not ban) users comments with swear words.

This did not go well, a lot of the mods scrambled in modmail because we were unaware, before I (/u/cgmcnama) [shut down the “event”](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/d33t6g/update_freefolk_positivityweek/)  but did not remove “I’m-Not-Steve”.  Why not remove?  In my judgement there is a long history of trolling here and past events were mixed receptions.  Additionally, they individually account for about ~25% of all mod work so I was not going to unilaterally remove them and would have preferred to work something out (like reduced sticky privileges)

Ultimately, the mod team were still split, currently discussing the matter, and [Varamyr made the decision to remove “I’m-Not-Steve”.](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/d3e94m/it_is_done/)  But some mods took it personal as they believe they were “thrown under the bus” and some modmail screenshots were shared that should not have been.  In the chaos of mass reports, a mod decided to shut down the subreddit to catch up on modqueue reports (you can’t make new reports if you can’t access the site.)  For obvious reasons, a horrible idea, hard learning lesson, and the subreddit was down for about 15 minutes.

Moving forward, users were still understandably upset but we thought we were making progress and sorting things out.  Things turned worse in the evening and the head mod took the odd decision to publish [this](https://i.redd.it/6d2d5tzz3em31.jpg) image that ended up doing the rounds and enraging many people. Something that could have been avoided by posting it with [the start of the conversation](https://imgur.com/a/giGOj2H) which changes the context of the following conversation. The head mod also later decided to take the subreddit private, removed Varamyr as a mod because they felt ""thrown under the bus"" by his description of events and alleged he shared the modmail screenshot that made her look bad, leading to more harassment and doxxing. She then removed the privileges of other mods so they couldn’t undo it.  Many of us send messages to the Admins, and to Leaf as no one has any idea what was happening at the time, including the reason for removal of permission or why the sub was lock, but it was late at night (US time) and the top mod brought the subreddit back after about 13 hours - during which time members of the mod team attempted to contact and coordinate with one another to figure out what was going on, but to no avail. 

Once the sub was unlocked finally, we had a big venting session trying to work things out.  I (/u/cgmcnama) got back mod privileges, corrected Automod which some people made changes to before we shut down, we issued a public statement catching people up, messaged nearly all 200+ people who PM’d us asking why subreddit went down, and gave Varamyr full permissions assuming the problem was more or less solved.  More drama ensued with the top mod and they eventually restricted all the other mods privileges again before taking the subreddit private again.

Once again we messaged the Admins and got very  speedy help with the subreddit being down for about 40 minutes.  The head mod had their mod privileges revoked by Admins for abusing mod powers, only can use modmail, and we are trying to work things out.  In any case, the head mod can always abuse their powers like that on any subreddit but there is an implicit trust they will not.

---------------------------------------

Going Forward

As this issue is still very much a real-time, work in progress for the mod team, we simply do not have all the answers as of yet. Bearing that in mind, and coupled with the myriad of messages asking us what is going on, we feel there is an onus to get preliminary information out as quickly as we can. 

As such, our new priorities from here on out are as follows (in no particular order):

- Implement a protocol for adding non standard sticky posts to prevent mods going into business for themselves

- Draft out a post for recruitment of new mods to replace those lost. We lost some active mods. They need replacing. There will be a way to do as such without a mass outrage. So let's figure it out. Together.

Keep updated with any further development in this fiasco. Full disclosure seems to be key. 

So that is that. If there's anyone who feels the need to have their say, now is the time and place. Obviously being constructive would be a preference. We are very much open to ideas, so let's hear them.

The real leaks are as follows :


1. Episode starts with an introduction to elephants and the threats they face due to poaching, habitat loss, and as of recently, Cersei.


2. The Mountain murders Missandei in cold blood, thus revealing himself as an American cop.


3. Grey Worm doesn't go crazy due to that though, he's a professional dude. He comes across a nest of giant flying cockroaches, which is the reason the Unsullied go batshit crazy.


4. The Night King gets accidentally resurrected because why the hell not.


5. Dany doesn't die because Jon kills her. Not directly. Actually, Dany is an anti vaccer and she catches the pox, which is aggravated by the harsh cold, and she dies due to that.


6. Cersei isn't stabbed by Jaime. Or Arya. Or Euron. Or anyone else. The NK, who is actually Voldemorts long lost cousin Coldemort, and also incidentally Darth Mauls nephew, turns up and Avada Kedavras her ass with a lightsaber.


7. The Golden Company kill Rhaegal by reading him the fanfiction masquerading as leaks on r/freefolk. Rhaegal can't take the bullshit any more and shoots himself with a ballista. Drogon, however, tries to yell ""Shut Up Assholes!“ but since dragons don't speak English (yet), it comes out as rhythmic dragonfire, and toasts the GC.


8. Arya is Azor Ahai reborn. Even Azor Ahai was a sneaky ninja apparently. Born amidst salt and smoke was a reference to the smokescreen for the stealth and the salt represented the salty bastards complaining about it.

28,bixodh,"[Spoilers] just like that, ENTIRE TV AND BOOK SERIES RUINED by S8 EP3, writers, and producers, here's why:","**dont just downvote this if you disagree, tell me why im wrong! main got subreddit keeps deleting because hbo must be paying them...**

&#x200B;

**29 years of books, still ongoing. 8 years of the tv series. all RUINED in one single episode**. the proclaimed epic episode of 82 minutes, longest battle sequence ever filmed, millions of dollars spent, weeks of filming, all to RUIN THE ENTIRE SERIES AND WORLD of GOT. i am, and we should all be, very upset. do you ever wait so long for something with great anticipation, for years and years, seeing it built and watching it grow into a masterpiece, and someone ruins it in an hour and 22 minutes? or really, in a few seconds at the end of that hour and 22 minutes?

&#x200B;

1. **first i will summarize why they and this episode have destroyed not the undead and the night king, and not alternatively mankind, but actually the entire GOT world**, our hopes and dreams, and the literary value, magnificence, magic, and uniqueness of GOT.
2. then **i will rebut those who disagree** and think it made sense and was good.
3. finally **i will go through more issues and problems with this episode, the writers/producers, plot, etc.**

&#x200B;

**1) ENTIRE SERIES RUINED**

**1a) lack of significance, weightiness, and time spent.** the entire GOT world, the premise of the series, from the opening scene of the books/show, the titles of the books, the prophecies and legends, the trials, tribulations, progress, and development of characters all built up to, pointed towards, and led to the battle of fire and ice, life vs death, humankind vs the night king, white walkers, and wights. and yet, after all these years, this entire overarching, massive plot is over in one single absurd episode. two whole episodes before for characters to chit chat about things so inconsequential relatively speaking. all fan service. 3 more episodes left now in the entire series, presumably to deal with the petty inconsequential squabbles of humans, fighting against cersei, whatever internal emotional/familial/incestual/petty squabbles of jon and dany etc. but the literal BATTLE OF LIFE AND DEATH was one single episode.

&#x200B;

1b) **NO PAYOFF.** so much plot build up was just destroyed, never used, and useless. all of bran's powers and growth etc, useless. he didnt use them to help with the battle, didnt use his ravens to tell of the movements of the night king, didnt talk to anyone at all. didnt use past knowledge. he didnt even warg into any other animals to fight, humans, dragons, nothing. the prophecies, the lord of the light, the red priestesses, JON BEING RESURRECTED, the dragon glass, the entire idea of the night's watch and the wall, the children of the forest, uncle benjen, the horn of joramun, meera, the prior 3 eyed raven, bran's visions, dany's visions, NONE OF IT MATTERED. this is like the show lost, when you have all these mysterious things happening and small details and youre just waiting and waiting for the explanation and the significance and payoff, then on the very last episode, they explain almost none of it, and all of that was for naught. or if in true detective, if all the little clues and details and breadcrumbs actually in the end meant nothing and they find out there was a security camera that caught everything and there is no actual mystery.

&#x200B;

1c) **anticlimactic.** furthermore, this makes the entire prior plots cheap, useless, anticlimactic. it's like you dated someone for 29 years and had this incredible relationship growing every day, and then at the end you found out they were just an actor in the truman show, or a russian/german spy planted to get close to you, and now every past moment is ruined and cheap and worthless and fake.

&#x200B;

1d) **ruins the last 3 of 6 episodes** of the entire series. so now these last 3 episodes will be so minuscule and minor in comparison. so inconsequential, so absurdly insignificant. how can you even care after this?

&#x200B;

1e) **goes against the whole ethos of GOT**. the uniqueness, value, emotional and psychological thrill of GOT was the ""grittiness,"" the real-life writing, the lack of absurd character armor, and the harsh fate of reality on good people and main characters. one of the whole things about GOT was that it was NOT lord of the rings where good guys win and bad guys lose.

&#x200B;

**2) rebuttal**

**people are saying:** that the night king and wights etc are boring, not interesting villains, dont talk, dont negotiate, dont have tricky plots etc. this is all true. people are saying that the whole series has always been about the characters, about the game of the actual throne, this is sort of true. it is true that is has been the huge majority of time spent in the books and show. and it is true that it is the source of most of the interesting, engrossing, unique, and enjoyable parts of GOT in general. and so, that is why the majority of time was probably written and spent with the characters and not following the night king around in the north as he walked very slowly around, killing wildlings, reviving dead people, making snow angels or whatever he does in his free time.

&#x200B;

**rebuttal**: HOWEVER, the fact remains, the whole story arc, writing, character plots and development, **everything points towards the battle of the living vs the dead.** when ned says winter is coming, he doesnt mean cersei and a glass of chilled wine. so it is okay that 99.9% of the time and words have been spent on the humans, but at the end of the day (or many years), the reality of this fictional world is that facing an undead army and the prospect of extinction is far more serious and important than any human squabbles, or should be. it should not be over in a single episode. far more episodes were left as cliffhangers, or character fates unknown for multiple episodes (ie jamie's avoidance of dragon fire, jon's resurrection, tormund's fate with the wall falling, etc). but the night king, with all the hype and build up, is over in a single episode.

&#x200B;

**cersei and throne have zero impact on the most important ultimate conflict.** furthermore, even if you want to think the entire threat of the undead is just a background side minor plot, a device to motivate and move the pieces of interesting characters around the chessboard that is the game of thrones, and that cersei, jon, dany, incest, babies, tyrion, etc are actually the only important parts of the story, then how is it possible **cersei** and the lannisters and the golden company are just chilling out at king's landing, and **literally HAVE ZERO IMPACT on the battle of the living vs the dead??** if cersei and fighting her are so important, then her not fighting with them against the undead should have had dire consequences, or at least some consequence whatsoever. the entire plot line of bringing and wight to show her, tyrion convincing her, her lying, jamie leaving anyways, etc, how could all of that LITERALLY NOT MATTER AT ALL??? NO RELEVANCE OR PAYOFF. if the throne is so important, then how can the current owner of the throne not matter in the most important conflict of the world? if the throne doesnt matter then since the current owner is not involved, then how can we possibly think the throne matters after the most important conflict of the world is over???

&#x200B;

**alternative-extension:** the night king could have taken at least 1.5 episodes, no? the outlook could be dire, everyone dead or close to death, jon battles him and loses, even without dying. dany flees on drogon, some people escape, bran does SOMETHING, ANYTHING AT ALL, and then in the next episode arya somehow magically kills the night king right before he kills bran. the tv writers and producers want to drag out brienne's plot, pod's singing, arya and bran's boring arcs, throw in gratuitous arya sex scenes, but the night king, the ultimate baddie, the end all be all of the GOT world, gets a few seconds in one episode. **and then somehow we have to care about 3 more episodes about cersei and a couple double dates of incestuous couples?? the night king deserves his due and respect.** **the point is, by having it so quick, with so little time dedicated, over so easily, in the middle of the final 6 episodes, it just cheapens the entire build-up and overarching plot of the entire world and series.**

&#x200B;

**alternative-reordering:** so then fine, you fan servicing-sycophantic, unoriginal and weak tv people, have your cersei conflicts and incest targaryen infighting etc etc, but have it before the ultimate threat of an undead army is resolved. have it earlier by necessity, and the undead can be freezing and resurrecting their way through the north until it's resolved. fine, have a lord of the rings absurdly unrealistic, decisively not-gritty, not-shocking ending and battle with said undead army and night king, but at least have it after all the more interesting, but less important stuff. there is a reason the series opens with the threat of the coming undead winter army, and not with cersei debating with someone--ie because that is big bad ultimate sci-fi threat that should be resolved at the end.

&#x200B;

**is the sudden death of the night king actually consistent with GOT ethos killings? short answer, no.** i havent seen this yet, but one might actually argue that the way the night king is suddenly and ""unexpectedly"" killed by arya after having such an overwhelming victory (with the exception of the inability to kill any of the 10 people with a name with his 100,000s of of soldiers), is actually consistent with the shocking unexpected deaths of ned, the red viper, the red wedding, etc. but the difference is, 1) he is the ultimate baddie, not a good guy, so it is more lotr obvious/feel-good/lame. 2) the entire series (and presumably 100s-1000s of years) has built up to him and this, similar to jon or dany, as opposed to one series/book with ned, a scenes with oberyon, a few years with rob, and there were other related good guy characters to fill their place. there is no alternative second in command or little brother or sister to replace the night king, (his entire army is literally all unmade) and only 3 episodes left so no time for that either. **3) the actual killing itself is absurdly implausible.** the others were shocking, but not anything near to outside the realm of possibility. in fact, they all made sense to some degree in retrospect. in fact it is true we have seen the white walkers are not the most amazing fighters, and generally seem to underestimate humans, valyrian steel and dragonglass. so it seems feasible maybe that even the super powerful and accomplished night king could not fathom a small human switching hands and stabbing him. however what is entirely not feasible is that arya could walk through an entire army, and entire encompassing circle of both wights and white walkers, without one of them noticing her. she literally couldnt hide in the labyrinth of a castle that was her home, from 1 awkward dumb wight. maybe if she were already hiding in a hole under bran's wheelchair, hiding up in the tree above, **hiding under a pile of snow and pricked the foot of the night king!!!!!** pole vaulted herself from the rooftops, cut off a wight's face and put it on, then maybe it might be within an artistic licensed sense of plausibility, but no, they just didnt notice her, and then after all her sneakiness, she had to shout a warcry right at the last second.

&#x200B;

**3) many absurd plot issues**

* as everyone is saying, not a single actual main character died, absurdly. wights charged and killed a shield wall of unsullied in seconds, 10s-100s of thousands of dothraki screamers, on horses, with flaming arakhs, but samwell tarly lying down covered with wights can survive? jon can fight through literally a field of wights by himself? jorah can be stabbed many times and dany who doesnt fight can as well? this goes against everything that is GOT. this is fan-servicing crap by tv producers and writers.
* WHO SENDS YOUR CALVARY INTO THE CENTER OF BATTLE, FIRST, ALONE, AGAINST FAR SUPERIOR NUMBERS??? this makes ZERO MILITARY SENSE. all the brightest minds of the lands, all around that big strategy table planning session, genius tyrion, jorah, grey worm, and BRAN WHO KNOWS AND/OR CAN SEE ALL HISTORICAL FAILED AND SUCCESSFUL BATTLES, dont reserve their calvary, dont send them on the edges to encircle and cave, dont target the white walkers, but just send them as sacrificial lambs? the supposed 100s of thousands of dothraki screamers??
* why not just stay inside the walls to begin with!?? there was literally 0 advantage to fighting in the field. the undead had superior numbers. killing them one by one as they climbed the walls worked quite well, and if all those thousands of dead outside the walls were instead up defending the walls, and not resurrected to fight against them, they could have held the walls for a long time. AND dragons could easily burn indiscriminately all over outside, constantly, in circles and burning rings of fire.
* why dont we see a single undead resurrected dothraki/horse?
* why does melisandre walk so slow to light the fire!?
* why did they not have a single jar of wildfire, or even jars of tar to pour and light? massive amounts of wildfire used just to kill the tyrells and sparrow, but not the undead army?
* what is the point of bran's warging with ravens if he literally does not tell information to a single other person? what is the point of bran, at all, ever, for anything???
* why do drogon and rhaegal not use fire a single time against the ice dragon to burn it and kill it literally in 1 second?
* why the hell does dany leave drogon sitting on the ground, a literal sitting target for white walker spears, allowing wights to crawl all over and stab drogon?? and come up to attack her? he flies...
* why does arya run around the castle killing wights left and right so easily, and then suddenly decide she is afraid and goes and runs away and hides from 1 then a few very slow wights in the castle? super badass trained assassin who just killed 100s of wights cant even contemplate the thought of 1 more??
* but yet, melisandre gives her one pep talk and suddenly not only can she kill 1 wight again, but sneak through a few 100,000s of wights, and kill the night king? this is absurd
* why didnt ned and catelyn arise from the tombs? why didnt any of the dire wolves?

extras:

* did anyone else think it looked like the night king was going for the high five with bran!?!? lololol
* why do some wights shatter/disappear into nothing when dying, while others pile up as bodies??
* generally, why are there any skeleton or decomposed wights at all, if they were all killed in the north/very recently, they should be frozen and preserved and look like humans with injuries...
* as people previously predicted, they should have had characters have to fight resurrected wights they knew, ie mormont v undead mormont, undead ed v sam whom un-undead ed saved.. etc

bigger plot holes

* bran's whole arc and learning and skills are not utilized as mentioned above. in particular, he has the ability to affect the past, ie shouting to his dad, hodor thing. that never gets any payoff???
* literally all of winterfell could have been deserted, not a single soldier, just bran sitting there by himself, and arya could have done the same thing somehow, with the same result. the entire battle was essentially useless.
* most of the characters were essentially useless.. especially in this battle they actually didnt really do anything.",92,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bixodh/spoilers_just_like_that_entire_tv_and_book_series/,2019-04-30 05:47:41

32,bka938,"Season 8 Episode 3 makes complete sense and here's why. You can whinge, downvote, call me a kneeler, throw me over the wall for all I care. But I'll defend this episode until my final death, I will not kneel. This was a good episode","Let me start by saying Arya is my favorite character of this show ever since the first season, so if you want to call me an Arya stan and thats the reason why I defend this episode then fine but that's not why it makes sense.

I'm not going to talk about a lot of the complaints people have about this episode because a lot of them are just whingers looking to whinge. I'm not a army general, hell I never even prestiged in Call of Duty, so I'm not going to pretend I know how military strategy works but I will say it makes more sense to me 
 for the Dothraki to charge with their horses then for them to just stand there and wait. Also shut the fuck up about darkness.

_____________________________

Alright on to my argument. I'm sure a lot of you have heard why it makes sense for Arya to kill the Night King. She's literally been training for this her whole life whether she knew it or not. She also makes connections with a lot of people who are involved in the Lord of Light like Mel, Beric, and the Hound. All of these people are kept alive until they are needed at Winterfell to get Arya to the Godswood. There are also a bunch of hints that only seem obvious after the fact such as the different colored eyes and the journey of Catspaw from almost killing the Three Eyed Raven to killing the Night King.

 So that explains why its her, and if you want to say Jon has a deeper connection with the NK you're kinda right. He's looked at the NK like twice before which I guess is more than anyone else. But the NK also represents Death, and no one is more familiar with Death than Arya. Whether it's witnessing the Red Wedding first hand, watching her first trainer right before he dies, or in Braavos being a faceless man (The embodiment of death as far as humans go) she's had a strong relationship with death.

Now may be the point where you say ""I know /u/Captain_Saftey , It makes sense WHY it's her. But the way she actually did it makes absolute 0 sense."" I will conceded that the show-runners should have made this scene make more sense on camera but first let me explain why it works.

There stands the Night King. He just killed Theon Greyjoy, the last line of defense for Bran Stark, the Three Eyed raven. His army has basically taken Winterfell and after this battle stands a good chance to take Kings Landing and the rest of the world. But the Night King does not care about that, because none of that matters. What he wants to do is wipe man and all traces of it out of existence and to do that he must kill his opposite, the Three Eyed Raven. From the moment he killed Theon he knew he had won. All the heroes of the world were busy fighting his endless army, the only man he would fear, Jon Snow, is facing down a dragon single handed. No one can stop him now.
So no one does stop him.

The way the White Walkers in this show act lead me to believe that the AOTD is a hive mind. Thats why when a walker dies all the wights around him die too. Right now every White Walker is with the Night King staring down Bran because thats the Night Kings ONLY FOCUS throughout the show, to kill Bran. Which is why he wouldn't notice the sneakiest sneak in the whole show come from behind. It's been established in the library scene of this episode that Arya can sneak past the dead when they're distracted, which they clearly are because they're all 100% focusing on whats happening in the center of the Godswood because thats where their King is focused. If you need more convincing about this than it explains why the NK is always at an elevated position in battle, so he can command his forces. When he's on the ground he's at a major disadvantage which is why he raises his army instead of fighting Jon earlier this episode.

Thats my take on this episode. I hope you can understand where I'm coming from and maybe this makes the episode more enjoyable for you. I know I liked it. If you want to argue or question any of my points please do. To conclude if I could make any change to this episode I think all I would do is a better establishing shot to show that its not impossible for Arya to get to the NK.

35,bm4oin,Why I dislike Dany,"I have made it pretty evident in all my comments and posts on this sub that I do not like or root for Dany. I know now because of all my lovely downvotes that despite claiming to be non kneelers this sub has a ton of Dany lovers so here is why I dislike her.

In the beginning I loved her - both in the books and the show. She was the one true queen who was the natural heir and had a vision which was to reform the political system (break the wheel) and I loved her for that. She was the people's queen in a sense and did all the right things - freed slaves, freed the unsullied, proved to the Dothraki that women can lead a khalasar etc - I loved her strong, feminist outlook on her route to the throne. 

Then shit started going south. She got over confident.Exiling Jorah was one of the biggest mistakes she made. Yes, I know he betrayed her etc but she did not give him a chance at all which made me see her flaw which was her distrust and the inability to give people second chances. She locked Doreah and Xaro in a vault to die slowly which is where I started seeing her ruthlessness - this was no diffferent to Cersei leaving Ellaria to die in the dungeons. 

She then burnt the Tarlys which was a major faux pas. She made Tyrion her hand to give her advice but she didn't take it in this case. She doesn't have to as she is queen blah blah and the final decision rests with her but the fact that she decided to burn them especially Dickon when she could have just imprisoned them was reminiscent of her father. That's the point I completely lost my love for the character. 

Since then somehow the kind, loving yet powerful Danaerys Stormborn became a cocky, hot headed sulky child who was capable of losing her temper and acting on emotions instead of logic which does not a stable ruler make.

I have since hated every single thing she's done. Asking people to bend the knee or die - I mean come on. Jon refused and so she fell in love with him. Even worse, she now told him to not tell anyone who he really is and lead the rest of his days serving her as Jon the bastard instead of Aegon the rightful heir. I mean, manipulative much?

Her dynamic with Sansa - people seem to think that she was being so friendly to Sansa but Sansa was bitchy to her - sorry but Jorah is the one who suggested she go make nice with Sansa but when Sansa skipped over the flowery stuff to getting real and asked about the North, Dany's face twisted. 

Its sad that the Northerners don't support her the way she wants but again there is an explanation for this - she was able to impress non Westerosis with her magical unburntness and dragons and free them etc and earn titles of Mhysa, Breaker of Chains blah blah. But this is the North - the oldest and largest establishment in Westeros - noble, houses older than the Targaryen line who's support has always been of importance to the capital/ruling party and known for their distrust in non-Northerners. The Lannisters wouldn't receive a good reception so why should a foreign queen come from nowhere claiming to be the last Targaryen and rightful queen get that kind of respect without her having done anything for them yet. Yes she brought her armies to help them but if she hadn't the White Walkers would have defeated the north and got to Dragonstone, Kings Landing etc anyway. There are no slaves to free here or slave masters to kill. There is no Dothraki here to marry or take across the sea for the first time. There is no ruthless training of young boys to become Unsullied. This is the proud North.

Instead of becoming humble with all the worship and support she was getting, she became over confident. Add the dragons and she became obnoxious and thought she was unbeatable. This led her to make poor decisions. Add the love of Jon and she thought the North and Jon for that matter would bend for her - why?!

My dislike for Dany has been progressive - it wasn't that I looked at her and was like oh blonde bitch, hate her. 

Anyway, this post has gotten pretty long but I hope I've made my point.

49,bpzy4z,*Whispers* y’all know this is exactly the book ending for major characters’ plot resolution too right?,"PSA: if your main complaint is execution/pacing this ain’t about you and y’all don’t need to start another petition or whatever. This is for the folks who say they ruined the characters. 

I’ve seen too many posts from regular contributors to this sub who claim to have read the books talking about character ruination with the heel turn changes D&D have made over the two most recent seasons flat out lying when they say “GRRM is our only hope,” “the books will have a better ending,” “he’ll never have Jaime go back to Cersei,” etc. when GRMM and D&D have made it abundantly clear that ALL major character arcs (the Starks, Lannisters, and Dany) and the overall plot of the series end in exactly the same place. 

The ONLY difference between the two is how they arrive at the same endpoint. 

Jaime: maybe after the stoneheart encounter he no longer trusts Brienne because it definitely would look like she brought him to die and thus he goes back to the only woman he’s ever trusted *but they will absolutely both still die together romantically because that’s the endpoint of their arcs.*

Dany: Mad Queen was foreshadowed plain as day from books 1-5 and you’re in denial if you think she’s gonna turn out any different in print

Jon: There is no NK in the books (yet) so the question of who kills him isn’t relevant as of now. In terms of Jon’s ending I’ve always thought, and the majority of the people in this sub have as well, that Jon (Azor Ahai) will kill Dany (Nissa Nissa, but wild I guess) and save humanity. Originally the great threat was assumed to be the WW given the “end the Long Night” talk but that all could be referencing Jon uniting the different factions to fight together and the Lightbringer bit is related to ending the threat the Mad Queen and her dragon(s) pose(s) to the world after she takes the throne. The speculative aspect of what the prophecy means or how it plays out isn’t important, but the fact is *Jon will kill Dany in the books and take the black as atonement for his dishonor.*

Bran: y’all best have this same energy when GRRM plants his unfeeling ass on the throne because that’s exactly what’s going to happen, and, no matter how much context or foreshadowing builds to that conclusion, y’all dismiss it outright as boring and stupid so don’t be calling him a genius for writing 30 extra pages detailing why and how Bran gets there. 

Sansa & Arya: more than half the complaints about these two, particularly Sansa, come down to internalized sexism and I’m not gonna go there, but Sansa is gonna rule the North and Arya is going to be an anime ninja somehow and kill a major player and that’s a fact. 

Tyrion: Dany will end up viewing him as ineffective and borderline treacherous somehow because that perception is what has been built up as his final crossroad plotwise. He’ll either be executed or betray her in a consequential way, and how he gets there likely comes from betrayal or incompetence. A drunk depressed dwarf doesn’t always make good decisions so the latter is still very much a possibility. Either way, Tyrion will not be the witty genius y’all view him as by the end of the books either. 

If you don’t like this ending for strictly pacing/rushing then say your piece because it’s valid. If you don’t like this ending for plot resolution then you best not read book 7 when it comes out, Gods willing, because no amount of petitions is going to make your fanfic become canon.",61,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bpzy4z/whispers_yall_know_this_is_exactly_the_book/,2019-05-18 06:23:03

If you think about it all the Stark children’s stories have been about becoming certain archetypes. Jon learning to be a commander, Arya learning to be an assassin, Bran becoming...whatever he is, but Sansa’s arc has been her becoming a politician and I believe the message of the story has been setting political squabbles aside and coming together for the greater good.

Joey Dempsey Interview

'

Jon Snow is the luckiest character in this damn story and I hope in season 8 we will see him acknowledging this and feeling bad for being so ingrateful and grumpy in his entire life.



By being raised as a bastard son of a High Lord in Winterfell, Jon Snow experienced the best of both worlds. He grew up in a beautiful castle, surrounded by luxury and comfort, he had a High Lord education and was trained by the best of what the North had to offer. He also, had the fortune to have a home and a family. Gendry never had any of that, he was raised in the streets of Kings Landing and never had someone to guide him in life.

As a bastard he was also protected from being hunted down like Viserys and Daenerys because of their true born names. Both viserys and Dany were used and treated as paws at very young ages by people who wanted to use them in their own selfish plans. Jon was spared of that.

Jon was raised by Ned Stark; Dany was raised by Viserys, I mean. Its doesnt get worse than that to be honest. Talk about disparity.


Because he was a bastard, he joined the Nights Watch (which sucked) but, by being stucked at the Wall he was kept safe from all the wars and political chaos that fell upon Westeros and was given time to mature into a more wiser leader, something that his older brother Robb simply didnt have the luxury. 

When Ned was arrested and later killed by Joffrey, Robb was forced to take the role of Warden of the North and lead his armies into war, but as a 14 years old he was simply not ready to take such task and we all know what happened in the end. He endure a brutal and heartbreaking ending. Because Jon was a bastard at the wall, nobody cared about him. While Sansa was a captive in KL, being abused and tortured by Joffrey, or Arya was being chased down by the Lannisters armies and Bran and Rickon were running away, hiding in the North from the Boltons, he was left alone at the wall.  


While he was at the wall, he had the lucky to meet some of the most honorable and decent men of Westeros who wanted to educated him and help making him a better leader. Isnt that interesting how such shity whole like Castle Black, had the most fantastic group of men to guide and mold Jon Snow into a wiser leader. He was groomed into leadership by Jor Mormont, he was voted Lord Commander of the Nights Watch and had Maester Aemon and Sammuel Tarly to help him into this next experience.  In the other side of the planet, George RRM gave Dany, Daario, Jorah and Shavepate. Yes, she meets Ser Barristan but he dies very soon. I mean, talk about a group of creep parasites and opportunists. They are all following her because either they crave her power or they desire her sexualy. Again, I am sensing a disparity here. I dont remember Old Jor Mormont ever touching Jon Snow tits, like Jorah does with Dany. (yes, Missandei is a good advisor, but so young in the books)


Jon Snow, had a good childhood, he had time to grow into a good leader, he had the fortune to have the best roles models and he is by far the luckiest character in this whole story. Just like we had a scene of Sansa in the end of season 6 on the Godswood, realizing how lucky she was that she was ""always thinking about what she wanted and never of what she had it"",  I hope we get a similar scene with Jon, because boyyy, he was fucking  lucky.

I know he has a lot of fans here and I love his snowflake ass very much, but again, he was lucky.",71,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/8qyyrj/jon_snow_is_the_luckiest_character_in_this_damn/,2018-06-14 08:20:29

85,bnat7d,Unpopular opinion: 'The last of starks' is not really a very bad episode,"I know that this community hates season 8. I agree that the show has not been up to the mark since season 5. I was really frustrated by the night king's death and overall episode 3. Episode 4 also had certain bad moments and logic gaps. But it is not really the worst episode of the show. The character progressions are actually pretty good.

I find people complaining about 3 character points the most, dany, Jaime and jon
People are saying that dany does not deserve to become mad. But her entire story was leading to this arc, they perhaps did it too late, but it was coming. And it will definitely come in the books.
And for people saying she deserves better, no she is not a really good person. No one is good or bad. She never was a perfect hero. If season 8 has done anything really great, it's dany's arc

About Jaime, him going back to cersei was entirely true to his character. All his life he has been true to cersei. This does not throw his character redemption in drain, but actually makes him even more complex and real. It will also make him killing cersei better and more emotional.

And as for jon not giving attention to ghost, that was a mistake, but ghost will definitely come back with wildlings and save jon in some way.

Yes Euron killing the dragon was illogical. There were certain gaps in logic, which are inevitable if you're not grrm. Also the dialogue was also pretty decent. Again I am not saying this was a great episode, but definitely not the worst episode of game of thrones.",18,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bnat7d/unpopular_opinion_the_last_of_starks_is_not/,2019-05-11 14:50:21

97,cnl0po,Who has already cancelled their Netflix account?,"&#x200B;

We can complain and meme the shit out of the Rich copycat and his sycophant, but unless we put our money where our mouths are, they will continue falling upwards.  


I didn't use Netflix much of late, but I had a four-screen plan and I had gifted its use to family members, so I used to keep the account for them. Netflix has done the ONLY thing that it could do to make me write to four people I care about to tell them I cut their account. I thought they had me well-trapped with the four-screens account, since I might cancel for myself, but not for others... Oh, wait.  


I want to make a list here of the people who have cancelled (not ""are going to""/""intend to"", past tense here) their Netflix account on grounds of Netflix (just as HBO before) hiring Dumbrich and Dumbsycophant.  


They ignored the petition... I wonder if they will ignore this.  


As for those idiots who undoubtedly are going to say ""if you're going to hate every ending that you don't like..."", let me (again) clarify this:  


1. If the writers of Lost, Veronica Mars, How I Met your Mother or whatever TV series destroy their series... that's THEIR work they are destroying. I might agree or disagree (haven't even seen Lost), but just as George Lucas with Episodes I, II and III: it's your work and you can stomp on it if you please. That does not apply to someone else's masterpiece.  

2. I am a book reader, and I wanted to read the masterpieces of psychological development that Martin was writing. It is true that Martin got stuck at Feast for Crows. But it is also true that the fame and success from the TV series distracted him A LOT. I'm glad Martin got his deserved fame and fortune, but point is, the TV series has influenced in Martin's time input on the new books.   

3. Dumb and Dumber have ZERO input in the series success. Period. The books are already written like a script, you can even see how the introduction of every single book is the cold opening to a TV series episode. What was good from the series was Martin's already-script-like writing, HBO's production values and Nina Gold's wonderful casting: not to mention the cast. Whatever was good, amazing, awesome, deep and fascinating in the series came from Martin, Gold and the rest of cast and crew. All the changes Dumb and Dumber included (more tit-time at the expense of more important scenes, the change in Cersei Lannister, the disappearance of Sansa Stark, AWFUL battles that make no sense, killing important characters because of the shit and giggles and because they can) make the overal plot poorer. It's just that everyone else was so good that most people didn't notice until the Professional Copiers ran out of books and Tyrion became an dull idiot. So, let's clarify this: these two can't write unless they are copying.   

4. I know life is unfair. I know that many people are able to do what they want in their life because they have money. But here, we have a rich kid and his friend who instead of writing their own stuff bought the rights to someone else's and when unable to produce original content, destroyed the work instead of passing it on to someone else, because they wanted to run away to Star Wars. That's disrespectful, to say the least. (HBO in nominating them for the writing category is what made me cancel my HBO account: you may make a mistake, but you don't insult me with my own money).   
So, I know life is unfair. But it doesn't have to get even more unfair with my money. Those two have enough of it as it is.   


So, starting here... Who has already cancelled their Netflix subscription AND told them that the reason was their hiring of Dumb and Dumber?",136,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/cnl0po/who_has_already_cancelled_their_netflix_account/,2019-08-08 16:24:38

105,36h7tr,We Need To Talk About Sexual Assault,"This became really long winded, sorry!  I've just kept coming across the same viewpoints which are bugging me.

First off, we need to realise that Westeros is NOT medieval England.  It really bugs me when people say ""well at that time"" because this time never existed! This is a world with magic and dragons, where seasons last years.  So saying ""well in that day and age it was acceptable for a husband to ..."" is not a valid arguement because although GRRM is inspired by real life events, the history of Westeros and Westerosi culture is not based on a real historic culture.

So, what are we here to talk about?  Sansa and Ramsay's wedding night, of course.

It's been a bit worrying on both sides of the coin so I want to try and address issues from both sides.  

**""It wasn't even sexual assault.""**

That there are people who watched this and didn't think it was sexual assault, even by Westeros standards, is slightly worrying.  To clarify, **marital rape is a crime and morally reprehensible in Westeros**.  The Kingsguard provide accounts of  Queen Rhaella being raped, and I think it is Jaime who regrets never intervening.  Cersei was also raped regularly by Robert Baratheon for the majority of her marriage.

So, Sansa did not have to ""give it up"" to Ramsay. 

**""But she knew she would have to sleep with him!""**

Yes, Sansa I'm sure had fully contemplated the thought of her wedding night.  We have to remember that Sansa has absolutely zero experience with boys.  She kissed Joffrey a few times and that was as far as it went.  There is no porn, she never went to any brothels, and she is a high-born lady and therefore has been spoken to as one.  Nobody has filled Sansa in on the bird and the bees.  All she knows is that since she bled, men have lusted after what she has between her legs.  Sex is basically a mystery to her further that what's meant to go in where, as it was for all of us on our first time (even after we had the benefit of porn!).

We know that the wedding needs a bedding, and consummating the marriage is important in Westeros.  Sansa agreed to sex, she probably knew it wasn't going to be a particulary pleasant experience.  She perhaps did anticipate that Ramsay would be brutal and sadistic, as Miranda had warned her as much.  Even if Sansa has seen through the looking glass what was away to happen to her and still agreed to go ahead with it, it doesn't change that **Ramsey commited a crime against Sansa**.

**""She didn't struggle or say stop.""**

This was not consensual sex and you would need to have some seriously dire social skills to think it was.    We don't see the whole scene obviously, but I think it's quite likely that she will have begged for Ramsay to stop at some point, certainly I think that was the way it was played out for us, with her screams/sobbing starting to become louder as the camera cut out.  Or she might have been too scared/frozen to protest, this still doesn't make it consensual.  Or, she may have stopped herself from speaking out because she is trying to 'play the game' and is waiting for the right time.  Forcing herself not to cry out for Ramsay to stop is still not consent.

**They have made Sansa's character weak again**

This viewpoint really should have died in the 1800's.  Rape victims are not weak people, they are rape victims.

**""They have made Sansa a victim again.""**

When did she stop being a victim?  She's a Stark, and they have been the victims of cruelty since Bran was pushed from the tower.  I highly doubt Sansa will suddenly turn into S2 Sansa because of this.  She will be traumatised by these events (this will now be a regular occurrence for Sansa, as things stand), just as she was by Lady's death, by Ned's death, by everyone's deaths.  

**""We saw marital rape in the first season, nobody was making a big fuss then.""**
Yes they did.  However i) the show had a smaller audience ii) it was early in the season and viewers had not grown attached to characters iii) there are huge differences between the two scenes.  Daenary's and Drogo is an unpleasant clip, but is nothing in comparison to the suspense, darkness, and general cruelty that is injected into Sansa and Ramsay's scene.  I think the episode had been really light-hearted up until this point on purpose, so that they would get maximum effect.  For example, Tyrion and Jorah got kidnapped and taken into slavery, yet instead of making this an 'oh shit' moment for the viewers, they told some jokes and sold us the story that they will both basically arrive in Mereen relatively safely. 

**""So murder is okay, torture is okay, but rape is a big no-no?""**

We see murder and torture all the time on television where rape remains difficult to show, basically.  We find joy in seeing the bad guys get their heads chopped off or their kneecaps broken.  But we don't (society as a majority) like seeing men or woman being raped.  Sons of Anarchy, Peaky Blinders, The Walking Dead and yes, Game of Thrones, are examples of shows which have included murder, torture, and rape, and rape is always directed and handled in a certain way that sets it apart from murder and torture, and everything else in television, really.

**""There's nothing to get upset about really, they didn't show anything.""**

It speaks for the directing that people feel such a strong emotional response to this scene without actually seeing the rape play out in front of them.  The scene was superb in that I'm sure the cast and crew have got exactly the reaction they were hoping for.

**""D&D have gone too far"".""**

Well, no, they haven't.  This isn't unchartered territory for Game of Thrones, and they aren't making television history with it.  We all feel really terrible for Sansa, but we all felt really terrible for Sansa a long time ago as well.  It was tough to watch, but we still have 4 episodes to go in the season and Sansa may very well get revenge soon.  Or maybe she won't, Robb didn't!  This is how the show has always been, people won't turn off now because of this scene/Sansa's character arc.

**""People are just being SJW's.""**

Some people probably are.  Personally though I felt pretty disgusted when the episode ended, it was really unpleasant to watch.  So was the Red Wedding, another really well shot scene.

**""They should have shown Sansa naked.""**

112,bm9n9h,Unpopular opinion: I don't think season 8 is that bad or bad at all for that matter,"This to me isn't even one of those times where I can understand why people are unhappy I have reached the point where I think people are looking for problems to have and ignoring what season 8 does well. 

I saw this with the last Jedi people seem to be under the impression that when you've followed a series for so long you're entitled to have your theories and expectations met. That characters you liked will get their heroic deaths or happy endings or that what you've been hoping for will come true but the writers don't owe you that their job is to create this show and they're doing it.

The term ""subverting expectations"" seems to have become a dirty word recently and I think it's because of what I mentioned earlier. 

People decided Jon's story was leading to a confrontation with the Night King but I disagree Jon's destiny was to lead the living against the dead and bring the dawn. Jon prepared the north for the war, Jon brought daenerys and her dragons and her dothrakhi and her unsullied and he fought the night king in the air and tried to get to him. Why does it matter who struck the final blow when it was Jon who brought everyone there. The Bolton's would still have Winterfell and Arya wouldn't have even been there without Jon so don't give me that about Jon not fulfilling his destiny.

Euron: nobody's favourite character but not as bad as some people make out. He's a villain you can hate and Qyburn's scorpions have been set up as able to pierce dragon's scales in the past Daenerys, contrary to the infamous quote didn't forget the Iron fleet she just didn't view it as a threat to her Dragons. Drogon was wounded by one of the scorpions in season seven and she dismissed it but a volley if them targeting an already weakened Rheagal? Doesn't seem unreasonable that that could drop him.

As far as Jaime's character goes we should probably see where things go before passing judgement as goes for many other characters. 

Ghost posts are seriously getting old yes we like ghost but direwolves have a bad track record down south and Jon may be right he'll have a better life with tormund living north of the wall than getting dragged from battle to battle with Jon getting more bits ripped off.

113,b8soiz,Shit we need to fuckin' acknowledge:,"1. No human alive can extrapolate major plot points from a still-photo of a character's facial expression. We need to stop with all of these ""in this shot, is Cersei sad about having a miscarriage because she was stressed about elephants?"" kinds of posts. They aren't confirmable or disprovable. They are just pathetic. 

2. The ""aftermath"" teaser and the new poster don't have any hidden clues in them. They are meant to be bleak atmospheric images that remind viewers how high the stakes are.

3. The Golden Company attacking Winterfell *makes no sense.* It just isn't going to happen. Why do you fuckers want it to happen so badly? Why do you overanalyze everything to try to promote this narrative? It just doesn't make any sense to me. 

4. Jon and Dany surviving and ruling together *is* a Disney ending, and absolutely *isn't going to happen.* Maybe they both survive. Maybe they both die. We don't know. But they sure-as-shit aren't ruling Westeros together with boatbaby crawling around in the throne room. Downvote me all you like if it makes you feel any better. But when the season is over and I am right, I'll have a good laugh about it. 

5. The ""passing the flame of life"" mechanic from the books just straight-up *isn't in the show.* The showrunners killed off Thoros intentionally to suggest to viewers that no one else is going to be magically brought back from the dead. Anyone who dies in season 8 stays dead. 

I'll take my downvotes now, ye cunts.

121,bjpxt4,It's not an unpopular opinion to be upset with S8E3 and why you're wrong," 

1. The episode was not too dark. - (User error. You probably watch stuff wrong all the time. I've seen TVs at friends houses etc. with a range of problems from every person looking tan, scary movies where you can't see anything or the contrast being too high or too low. If you felt the episode was too dark and you couldn't see anything, that is your fault.)
2. Arya was the only one who could kill The Night King 1vs1. - (I realized this in hindsight. Her character and training was a culmination that led to this event, foreshadowed by Melisande. That quick sample of TNK killing Theon shows his incomparable speed and power. Jon never could of done it. Which leads to the third point.)
3. The library scene was genius. - (It highlighted how she was quieter than blood dropping on the ground. It than justified and foreshadowed her ability to sneak past all the white walkers and get a jump on TNK. Something Jon could not do.)
4. Killing TNK with Cats Paw is beautiful storytelling. (That dagger appeared in S1 and made it all the way to S8. It was the same dagger meant to kill Bran, which ended up saving him. That's poetic as fuck and incredible writing.)
5. The main characters in the front-line didn't die, and that's ok. - (Those characters have three more episodes to do something, and they can't not be in the front-line. Yes, it is not ""realistic"" but neither is Dragons or zombies. Stuff gets passes all the time with no complaints, we see it all the time. This is perfectly acceptable.)
6. The tactics going into the battle aren't bad. - (They could of flanked with dothraki. They could of put trebuchets inside the castle. Jon could of lit the fire perimeter etc etc etc. In the end, they would of all died. It truly did not matter, with the one objective being to kill the TNK, which they did. A literal SEA of undead and the ability to extinguish fire with a winter storm meant nothing mattered other then cutting the head off.
7. The music scores/soundtrack is amazing
8. The dragon battle above the clouds was amazing (dance of dragons)
9. Theon had a near perfect death. - (Amazing character arc, coming home to save bran after falsifying that he killed him, and after he pledged to help Robb he did the same thing again for Bran. Truly a roller coaster ride, and after being afraid and running his whole life, he charged at something he knew would end him.)
10. Jorah had a near perfect death. - (Redeemed himself as a character by having no loyalty his whole life, but changing it around for dany. He fought to his literal last breath with the sword HEARTSBANE. And then dany cried the hardest she ever had not even comparing to Drogo or her dragon getting pierced out of the sky.)
11. Bran warging for half the episode obviously is a setup for the next three episodes. Pure, home-brewed, simple common sense.
12. Jon didn't do anything is false. - (He put everything into motion, got everyone there, distracted the dragon for arya to get by and had a cool dragon battle.)
13. Tyrion and Sansa now have a new story - (They could get married and could lead to a whole lot of something.)
14. The battle being one episode is ok - (It was the longest episode and this show is not called ""How to kill the white walkers"", it's called GAME of THRONES. That's the main focus, white walkers are a badass distraction.)
15. The Dothraki getting their weapons put on fire was awesome. (They got wrecked though, and that was on purpose. Inside the episode explains the ebb and flow of the battle, and the fact that humanity didn't have a chance.)
16. The wave of undead was a welcomed surprise. (rather than a stereotypical big, epic battle with a clash, you instead should of experienced horror and shock.)
17. Their's a good chance you're upset because your theory didn't come true. - (everyone seems to follow up their complaint with ""and they should of done this!"" like the night king flying to kings landing or something. I was a big proponent of that, but not upset at all that it didn't happen.)
18. The Night King's ambitions were clearly laid out for a long time, no excuse to be confused. (These barstool and youtube rants are super popular for some reason, with them saying they didn't get enough story from the NTK and white walkers. It's super simple. Their are scenes and explanation dedicated to how they were created and their purpose to kill humans, but the children of the forest, the creators, fucked up and they wanted to kill everyone. Then we find out in S8E2 they want bran to erase humans from existence, and memory.
19. Dragon fire not killing the NTK is ok. (He's the OG and most powerful. He was created by dragon glass, and that is the only thing that can kill him... plus valryian steel.)
20. So many people had great stories and their actions which propelled them to do things. The hound breaking out of his fear to save arya is one example. That was incredibly emotional and powerful. Their is a ton of callbacks and parallels in this episode that I think people just flat out missed.

You can't dislike an episode because it didn't do exactly what you wanted. That is literally you're own fault for setting a standard that is impossible.

122,bfpdq2,Change my mind: Sansa is one of the better remaining characters,"Her character develops from a from a spoiled teenager to an adult who knows the stakes and what it takes to survive.

She's also an important foil to Daenerys. Dany could always fall back on the use of force - either magic or her dragons - to get whatever she wanted, or to resolve a difficult situation. Sansa had to learn to be a politician and outmaneuver people. In other words, Sansa has grown up in ways that Dany still hasn't.

It sets up one of the more interesting character juxtapositions in the show, and it's nice to see the question of whether Daenerys will become just another conquering tyrant fleshed out.

Edit:

Seems like some people missed my point or don't understand what a foil is. This isn't another ""Daenerys sucks"" post.

&#x200B;

When Endgame came out, I saw this wave of opinion in reviews and discussions where most people agreed that it is very easy to nitpick, but lets instead enjoy it for what it is. It filled me with optimism, that we have now moved on from 20 minute youtube videos of pseudo-screenwriters improving movies and shows, and that we just might **stop watching entertainment with the intend to find flaws in it**. To be clear, I am not saying to turn your brain completely off. If something is jarring enough to pull you out of the experience, it is a problem. Sometimes though, you should consider that the problem might be in you.

&#x200B;

I am disappointed to see this sub fall almost to Last Jedi levels of hysteria. Anybody that honestly thinks this show is as much garbage as its being painted, needs to go watch the fucking walking dead or vikings, just to realize what it looks like when you favourite TV show gets torn apart by years of incompetence and when you cant bring yourself to watch another episode because it makes you feel dead inside.

&#x200B;

Lastly, Benioff and Weiss deserve more respect. They have worked their ass off to bring you a conclusion, while George sits on his ass all day, presumably crushing beetles with a rock. D&Đ have worked magic with the series, especially with the first season. If not because of them, I am confident most of you would have never known about the show or the books. ASOIAF are messy books, and adapting each of them into 10 episodes with proper structure, pacing and drama to make it entertaining must have been a titanic effort. I shouldn´t need to point out that calling D&D a pair of copycats is unbelievably ignorant.

145,bj0yy6,Season 8 Episode 3 is the worst episode in Game of Thrones history.,"This series is now ruined. Every episode will now look like a joke. Every rewatch will be laughable. You can skip every Night’s Watch scene. Every time someone says ‘Winter is Coming’ you can laugh because you know it isn’t true. When you watch Hardhome, you will know it came to nothing. When you watch the opening of the first episode of the show, you will know it came to nothing. When you watch/read/think about all the interesting theories about the Night King and the White Walkers, Azor Ahai born amidst salt and smoke, the ideology behind them, what they represent, the faults of everyone for not realising the threat sooner... you will laugh, because you’ll know it came to nothing. All over in one terribly shot, Hollywood-ized, fan service episode. Wow this used to be such a good show. 

George, if this is what you have planned, don’t release any more books, it will be a waste of time for everyone. But I know this isn’t your vision, and I feel sorry for you. That your reputation will be forever tarnished.

Winter was never coming.

It was a meaningless light breeze, over in an hour and a half, mainly shot in pitch black.

For most of the episode I sat there, squinting my eyes to see what was happening, barely interested and not immersed in the battle at all. I can’t believe the guy who did this also did Hardhome and Battle of the Bastards. I can’t believe it took them 55 days to shoot this episode. I can’t believe what I’ve just seen 😂

“The rules have changed. What used to be a fantasy show grounded in realism, has now turned into a budget Marvel movie to appeal to the masses of clapping monkeys. The show and the books used to pride themselves on thought provoking layered politics and an excess of logic and reason behind motives, survival, death and things that added depth to the universe. The foundation the show was built on these solid principles, and now it's been thrown out the window for one liners, cheap scares and the complete refusal to give main characters realistic or somber endings.” - quote from ‘hardware-19282’ on IMDb.

There is no point watching this show anymore. I won’t be buying the full box set on blu-ray that I told myself I would buy when it was over, to save money. There’s 0 point. There’s no point watching another episode, it’s a joke. I’ve lost all interest. I don’t care what happens. I don’t care.

If you disagree with me, go back and watch any episode from the first 3-4 seasons. Then watch Hardhome. Then watch this. It will put things into perspective.

George, I love you man, please don’t fuck this up like the show runners have done. At this point I don’t care how long it takes for you to release TWOW and ADOS. As long as they come out, even if you finish the last chapter ADOS on your deathbed, 15 years from now, that’s fine.

From what I seen on this sub the last days I'll rather be a fucking kneeler then a uncivil barbaric fanatic who wants to yells stupid comments instead of having a serious debate. 
Please act civil during comic con, don't act as a nine year old who's angry because another kid doesn't follow the rules of the game. If D&D goes to Comic Con and we scream at them as apes who do you think the media is going to point at as the idiots and bad guys? The two grown men being ridiculed and laughed at or the horde of screaming fanatics? 
I'm not trying to defend D&D, I am trying to make us not look like fucking idiots. Do you think that the actors is going to like that we rage on D&D? Sure many of them also disliked season 8 but do you think they would like it when they stand there on the panel, next to D&D, which the audience is booing at? I would be embarrassed by it, even if I am not the one being booed at. They would probably be dissapointed at us for not acting like adults.
 So when you are there, criticize them how much you want just as long as you stay civil. Don't embarrass us or the actors and don't make D&D look like the victims by bullying them.

169,bn4k2x,Dany asking Jon to hide his identity from his family was entirely selfish,"I keep seeing posts bashing Jon for not being able to keep his mouth closed, but REALISTICALLY him telling his family was always going to happen. Dany trying to ground him into submission with an ultimatum was purely selfish on her part. She never asked him his feelings on it at all. From the moment he dropped the bombshell it was always about the throne to her.

The man she supposedly ""loves"" has a life changing revelation and all she cares about is how it affects her claim on the throne. Jon spent his whole life looked down on as a bastard. It affected him so much that he hates the very idea of bastards. The only people who cared for him and saw him as more was Ned and his siblings, thus creating a deep familial bond. 

This information would mean the world to Jon. Now he knows he's not a bastard. He was born to parents who were in love, his ""father"" Ned proved how honorable he was by taking Jon in and sacrificing his reputation in the process, and although not siblings he's still half Stark. No one with a close family could keep that information secret. Sansa, Arya, and emotionless Bran deserved to know the truth of their father.

All that being said, I wasn't a fan of how it was portrayed. Jon worried foremost about his claim to the throne is weak. He's always found a way to pass power onto the next person, this isn't any different. 

Having Bran tell his sisters instead of himself was dumb. This is his big secret, he should be the one bursting to tell his family. 

Finally, obviously Sansa wouldn't keep her mouth shut; she hates Dany and her hold on Jon. Of course she would reach the same conclusion. Being in denial is just a flawed character development. When a family member hates your significant other it shows. Sansa never held back on that.

Short version: Jon would look at his lineage as a weight of his shoulders, not a burden. Telling his family would be the first thing he would want to do. Dany only cares for herself otherwise she wouldn't deny Jon and his family the truth.",53,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bn4k2x/dany_asking_jon_to_hide_his_identity_from_his/,2019-05-11 02:12:15

176,bo0w5j,I'm unsubscribing.,"I'm gonna get the [traitor](http://imgur.com/gallery/0WmZYxg) treatment for this but here I go anyways.

Reading through all the posts and comments tonight has made me realize that this sub has gotten in the way of my enjoyment of the show. The memes are pretty funny, but so many people here are ridiculously cynical and so quick to hop on the ""fuck D&D"" circlejerk.

Is the writing not as good as it used to be? Maybe, but that doesn't mean the show is absolutely garbage now. Are there things that they should have done differently this season? Maybe, but fuck it. I'm still entertained. Season 8 is a classic Half Life 3 scenario, there is nothing the writers could have done to meet everyone's expectations.

Every episode I've gone away from feeling mostly satisfied with until I come here and see all the shit people post, and it tricks me into thinking ""oh they're right, that episode was shit. Fuck the writers reeee"". And I forget about what was good about the episode. I could have been perfectly happy with the last season and never given it's fuckups a second thought if I didn't flock to this sub after every episode.

To me, Game of Thrones is about war and how fucked up and brutal it is. It's about family, honor, love, and how all those can go out the window when war and politics come into play. Game of Thrones could be about something else entirely to you, and that's fine. Sorry lads, but there's no changing the writing. For the love of the seven, can we just stop the hate and appreciate this show for what it is?

It also doesn't help the fact that all you care about is profit at this point of time and you really don't give a fuck about us fans.

193,cevmo4,"It's been two months since the series finale, the sadness and depression has receded a bit. I finally gathered the energy to write some things about what happened to the show we all loved.","It's been two months since the series finale aired, and this is the first time I'm writing something about the show's end. The entire ending had already leaked in this subreddit by the time Episode 4 aired, and I'm very thankful to the leakers for giving me the time to prepare for the nightmare that was coming. Still, the ending left me numb and sick to the core, and personally it felt like a colossal catastrophe is unfolding in front of my eyes. I can't put into words how disappointing and depressing that ending felt to me. For the last two months, I tried staying away from anything ASOIAF/GOT related because it was too painful, but sometimes, in the middle of the day, all of what happened flashed before my eyes and the numbness returned to my body, it felt like all the things which happened hasn't sunk in yet, or maybe that feeling of numbness will never wear off. Everything was unearned, underwhelming and utterly rushed. D&D really succeeded in destroying every single thing which made GOT and ASOIAF such an intriguing saga which was inhabited by multidimensional characters.

When the hell did everything started to go wrong?? GOT's downfall began from the moment when D&D started treating the characters as mere props who existed only to forward the storyline in a rapid pace. Blatant disregard of the already established in-universe logic along with the utter deterioration of dialogue are also the principal reasons for the shitshow of Season 8.

Oh, and how badly D&D butchered the character progression of all the main characters. Among the mains, I loved Arya, Daenerys and Brienne more than anything, and I saw all three of them being subjected to every single misogynistic trope in literature. My favourite characters were turned into one-note caricatures who only existed to finish the story as fast as possible. Everything was rushed because D&D were done with GOT and wanted to move on to their Star Wars franchise as fast as possible. Those two stupid, egotistical cunts fucked up everything because of their arrogance and overconfidence.

GRRM is the author of ASOIAF, and he should never change his intended ending for ASOIAF. An artist's inherent vision should never be hindered by anyone or anything. Even though I'll never like or support how everything ended, I'll accept the ending because that's how the author intended to end everything. I overestimated GRRM's capability of subverting the established literary tropes. The ending of GOT encompassed all the tropes that I hoped GRRM would avoid. We don't know how much GRRM will flesh out the individual character arcs leading to their eventual endgame in the books, but the overall message from ASOIAF's ending is very cynical and pessimistic. The message is that, basically, no one should ever dream of changing the world for a better tomorrow and no matter how hard you try to overcome your past baggage, it'll never let you go and you're destined to succumb to the very thing you tried so hard to avoid.

Needless to say, Dany's fate saddened me the most. She was a child who begged for food in the streets of a foreign city along with her exiled brother, who never slept soundly because of the fear of assasins catching up to them, who was sold as a slave to a fearsome warlord in exchange for an army, who's unborn child was murdered in her womb by a woman who's life she had saved....she endured all of this and turned it in her favour when she walked into the flames believing that it's not her destiny to wither away into nothing among the Dosh Khaleen. That girl empathized with the slaves and the downtrodden common people because she had been a slave herself and she understood what it means to be afraid, how it feels to be abused and raped on a daily basis. She did everything in her power to help them, she asked them if they would follow her to make the world a better place, she postponed her personal ambitions and desires multiple times to ensure that the new society they built is stable enough to stand on it's own. When this girl finally set sail for Westeros with the intention of conquering what her family had lost, she also dreamed of finding the home that she never had. She found a country ravaged by war, a sadistic tyrant on the Iron Throne and the ancient mythical threat of the White Walkers looming on the horizon. She tried using diplomacy and restraint multiple times while dealing with Cersei and other lords, only to be betrayed again and again. The grief of being unable to bear a child always weighed heavily on her and then she lost one of her dragons to save the rangers beyond the wall. She loved and cherished her dragons more than anything, but that didn't deter her from restraining them when necessary. Nevertheless, she never blamed anyone for her loss and she unconditionally pledged to help in the fight against the White Walkers and postponed her quest for the throne to fight for humanity's survival. Meanwhile, she fell in love during this tumultuous time, she dreamt that she would finally have the home she yearned for. The frosty northern reception and open hostilities didn't deter her determination, the reveal that the love of her life is a rival claimant didn't break her resolve, she pushed forward and fought for humanity with everything she had. She, along with her followers were ready to sacrifice their lives for the Westerosi people who'd never consider giving them their due respect. She lost countless loyal followers in battle, she lost her oldest friend in battle and her closest friend was put into chains and butchered in front of her. Even though they failed repeatedly, she gave her Hand and her Spymaster multiple chances to prove their worth, instead they betrayed her and tried to poison her. Dany gave her advisors many second chances, but her advisors gave her none. She felt increasingly isolated, she felt utterly rejected by her lover, she felt that her Hand had betrayed her from the start, she felt that the people of King's Landing had taken her restraint for granted. And then Daenerys Targaryen, who had never needed any reassuring words from others to pull herself out from utter misery, who relied on her own strength and the loyalty of her followers to push forward, who always empathized with the downtrodden common folk suddenly decided to burn down King's Landing after the city's surrender. She went from fighting for humanity's survival to destroying humanity in just one and a half episode. Then, after her declaration of continuing her fight, she was murdered by the man she loved the most. The lover who was convinced by her Hand that she's irredeemable and needed to be put down. The lover and the Hand who were saved by her multiple times and given second chances many times ended up murdering her. That's the tragedy of Daenerys Targaryen, she's always betrayed by the persons who's lives she had saved. She always gave them second chances but they never gave her one. Her death was the most underwhelming event of the entire series, the overall tragedy of her character arc hit me hard, but when I saw her death on-screen for the first time, I felt nothing. I just felt numb, D&D had botched the writing so bad that I didn't even shed a single tear during the death of the character whom I've loved the most.

Each act should have it's own reward.**"" Stannis Baratheon once said this to Davos Seaworth, and this is probably the line of thinking GRRM wants us to consider when we talk about the legacy left by a character. GRRM wants to question if redemption is possible for people who've committed the most heinous crimes, GRRM is on record saying that he wanted readers to feel sorry for Joffrey when he died. So, will GRRM be able to portray Dany's dark turn in the books in a believable but sympathetic way?? Will GRRM be able to avoid all the sexist tropes(a Woman scorned by her lover will be vengeful, a Childless Woman is abnormal and unstable, Women are inherently hysterical and too emotional, a Powerful Woman will always turn evil and corrupt) which D&D used to push Dany into darkness?? We'll probably never know, because the last ASOIAF book will never get a release date.

Lastly, I'll say one thing, D&D have consistently butchered Dany's character since Season 2. D&D stripped away Book Dany's charm, her intellect, her keen strategic mind for war, her humanity, her yearning for a home and family. D&D have continuously whitewashed the male advisors (Jorah, Daario, Hizdahr, Tyrion, Varys and Jon) around Dany to make her appear more cruel and impulsive. [This is a very well written post which discusses this subtly sexist habit of D&D in detail. Read this, I assure you that it'll be worth it.](https://rainhadaenerys.tumblr.com/post/183704880382/daenerys-books-vs-show-sexism-and-bad-writing) Most of Dany's male advisors did far more cruel and sinister things in the books, but all of that is totally non-existent in the show. All through eight seasons, we never got a single mention of Dany's yearning for the House with the Red Door, and instead they insert cringy dialogues like being unable to count to twenty. Why the hell would fans even think for a second that D&D were serious about adapting the later seasons?? D&D's incompetence and utterly irresponsible attitude deserves all the criticism and disdain they're getting.

The outrage and criticism against D&D are totally valid. Sensible fans know they're the two who are responsible for botching and rushing everything. This outrage is wholesome because it specifically targets those who are responsible, I'll accept that there are a few bad apples in this subreddit who viciously attacked a couple of actors, but it's a knee-jerk reaction in most of those cases. Some people really can't differentiate between an actor and a character, they're not sensible fans. You can criticise an actor's opinion, but to blame them for the writing and for what's happened on-screen is ridiculous. The fundraising effort started by u/elle_ellaria and u/alpinej0e which was subsequently promoted by r/freefolk, along with the overwhelming donations and Emilia's heartfelt response is the only thing which brought joy to me in the midst of recovering from the shitshow of Season 8. I'm using Reddit for years and I've browsed this subreddit since Season 7 leaked, and it's safe to say that this kind of fundraising effort is legendary in the history of Reddit. Those who donated or promoted the fundraisers are the real heroes of this fandom. I'll gladly say that I'm proud of being a part of r/freefolk, the only subreddit which managed to create the truly good things in the midst of all this misery.

I'm not trying to offend anyone but i feel like this subreddit is not the place for this kind of threads, just please create a new sub and talk about Jonerys all you want, i thought this subreddit was all about fuck the king and shit, not about the fucking way Jon looked at Dany when he was fucking her, i like them both but please enough is enough, their relationship is not the only thing you can discuss in this show.

213,bkxren,EPISODE 4 SUMMARY,"In King's Landing

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Lord Eddard Stark begins quietly inquiring into the death of Jon Arryn, the previous Hand of the King. Questioning Grand Maester Pycelle, who tended Jon Arryn in his final days, Stark learns that Arryn's last words were ""the seed is strong"" and that he was reading a book about the houses of the Seven Kingdoms

&#x200B;

Helped by Petyr ""Littlefinger"" Baelish and his web of informants, Eddard follows up on two more clues regarding the last days of his predecessor. He questions a smith's apprentice, Gendry, whom Jon Arryn had visited in his last days and deduces that Gendry is a bastard of king Robert Baratheon. Eddard also plans to question Jon Arryn's former squire, but he is killed by Ser Gregor Clegane, also known as ""The Mountain"" due to his towering size. He is a Lannister bannerman and is the older brother of Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane. As children, Gregor brutally burned his brother's face, thus explaining the Hound's scars.

&#x200B;

In Vaes Dothrak

Khal Drogo's khalasar arrives at the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys becomes angry and strikes her, Daenerys fights back, hitting her brother and threatening him. Later, Ser Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys would not be a good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms do not care who rules them as long as they are ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms, even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.

&#x200B;

At the Wall

The Night's Watch receives Samwell Tarly, a fat, fearful and clumsy recruit who rapidly becomes the focus of bullying by Ser Alliser Thorne. Sam later explains to Jon that his father forced him to join the Night's Watch and forsake his inheritance because he considered Sam unworthy.\[3\] Jon Snow defends Sam and convinces the rest of the recruits not to harm him. Thorne defends his treatment as essential, since life north of the Wall is very harsh, especially during winter, warning Jon and Sam to toughen up or they will have no chance of survival.

&#x200B;

In the North

Tyrion stops at Winterfell as he is returning to King's Landing after his visit to the Wall. He gets a cold welcome from Robb Stark, acting Lord of Winterfell in his father's absence. Robb suspects the Lannisters are behind his younger brother Bran's fall and the subsequent assassination attempt. Despite the cold reception, Tyrion shows Bran kindness by giving him blueprints for a saddle that will allow him to ride again despite his paralysis. Before he leaves Winterfell, Tyrion has a talk with Theon Greyjoy, a ward of House Stark, and taunts him over the Greyjoys and their failed rebellion against King Robert, calling Theon a ""hostage"" to the Stark family.

&#x200B;

At the Inn at the Crossroads

Further south, Tyrion and his retinue stop to spend the night at the Inn at the Crossroads. There he recognizes Lady Catelyn Stark in disguise. With her identity revealed, she requests help from her father's bannermen present at the inn to seize Tyrion to face trial for Bran's attempted murder.

220,b4y21e,The only thing that pisses me off about Sansa´s reaction to JONERYS is...,"...that she fucking MARRIED Ramsay Bolton, knowing full well that his father took part of the Red Wedding that killed her mother and brother.

&#x200B;

Why the hell she is getting all pissed about Jon and Daenerys because of her family? If Sansa is such a smart politcal animal, she should have been making wedding plans as soon as those two arrived at Winterfell to close the deal.

&#x200B;

I know that DnD just want to cook conflict because they are trash, but why the Hell they brought up the political marriage angle on season 6, to abandon it completely season 7 and now make characters that engaged in the practice suddenly forget about it?

&#x200B;

That is why people get so pissed at them- they ALWAYS take the easy route. Those people at Winterfell should indeed question Daenerys but the MAIN point of conflict should have been Tyrion and the Lannister´s alliance- they should be eviscerating Jon for not only going Beyond the Wall to convince Cersei to get on their side, but also to be fucking naive in just taking her word.

&#x200B;

Want to have Sansa and Dany get in a conflict? Well, why not the "" I cannot have children"" during marriage contract negotiations or the big cultural crash of having Dothraki there?

&#x200B;

EDIT: before closing for the day, there is a big difference between being forced to to something, or being convinced to do it. Sansa at King´s Landing was completely without allies and friends- she had to do what she was told, or else.

Sansa at The Vale had a very good opportunity to take power into her hands- she had already saved Lord Baelish from execution, being whatver debt she had with him- as  the Lords of the Vale were very pro Stark and against Baelish. 

To prove the stupidty of DnD plot and how they just give Sansa shit storylines because it fit their  plot- Littlefinger and Sansa travelled all the way to The North and they expect us to believe that Sansa did not notice ? The reveal he took her to the Dreadfort was among the most ridiculous things- but beware, she had WILLINGLY entered into a polotical alliance with Baelish and was not forced- but convinced- to marry Ramsay to somehow "" avenge"" her family.

240,blsi3g,Sansa is the worst,"I can't stand her. Since the moment Daenerys arrived she was openly hostile despite the fact that Daenerys came to save the North and Winterfell. Even after the battle Sansa still bullheaded and ignores that. You don't agree with Jon's decision? That's fine. Be polite, smile, shake hands and search for solutions in the background. This how her 'teachers' played the game. The show goes out of their way to portray Sansa as some sort of political genius, yet in reality she's stupid and shortsided. Before that, she publicly defied Jon's every decision on every turn, in effect undermining his rule, destablized the North so the moment he left for Dragonstone they were ready to turn on Jon. Another example of political profanity. Sansa was basically raised by Cersei and Littlefinger, she tries to emulate them but possesses only a fraction of their intellect.

On a personal level she's even worse. Insecure, hateful, selfish, duplicitous, jealous, arrogant, untrustworthy. She revealed Jon's secret the first chance she got, betraying him. Jon revelaed the secret for 2 reasons: 1). Honor demanded that he can't lie to his family, 2). He was hoping that revealing the fact Daenerys is his family too, the Starks will be more trusting and pro-Dany. 

Even if Jon doesn't get the throne, it's obvious that he and the North would be in great position: Queen of the Seven Kingdoms is in love with him and Jon is her only living family. Over time they could marry and work out some special deal for the North. And Cersei is out of the picture. Sansa can't see this, she goes all in, risking everything, placing Jon's and Dany's lifes in danger, seeding the chaos to see how it will play out and destroying Jon's new family and relationship in the proccess. Sansa, always preaching about the importance of family and she immediately tries to destroy his. At this point, Starks are no better than the Lannisters, fighting and scheming among each other.

How things will play out next:

Secret gets out, Varys hires a killer who fails but leaves an impression, Dany is undermined, unhinged, loses everything, enraged and betrayed on every turn. She takes the throne will blood and goes for Sansa forcing Jon to make a choice. He chooses Sansa and kills Dany. Mad Queen or not, Daenerys could've rulled for decades with justice and compassion. Dire circumstances pushed her to be that way, all because of Sansa. The moment she spilled the secret, she declared the war on Daenerys. A war from the person she recently saved from imminent death, losing most of her armies and dear friends and not even getting a 'thank you' or even acknowledment of that.

244,bl6ouz,"On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest, how stupid is the average viewer? From the posts from the last two episodes I’m thinking at least an 8.","There is no “mad queen” and all these posts are coming from sexist men or generally stupid people.

1. She is not dumb. Since she arrived in the north they have been undermining her authority, publicly. When you are the supposed ruler, and those around you also speak with authority, it causes confusion. They also actively speak about John being king and being a great ruler in front of the actual “king” as if it’s nothing. You don’t do that. When men are kings, from actual real life records from the middles ages as well as fantasy depictions, they kill those who say such things. You don’t joke about someone else being deserving of the throne in front of the king.

2. Her advisors are idiots. Tyrion and Varys both deserve death for their behavior past and present. Every time an issue arises and they don’t agree with her approach, they talk treason. She’s just like her father blah blah. Neither of them are loyal and the game must end. It would be one thing if they were absolute war/strategic marvels but they are not. They are honestly the worst kind of people, people who believe they know best. It is one thing to do the best for yourself, it’s another to believe you know what’s best for everyone. Daenerys has always given the innocent the choice at the very least. These two want to shape the world how they see fit and kill those that they don’t want in it. I’m glad Varys will die in the north.

3. It is fucking war. Do you people not own a history book? Literally every single war has something that people would consider terrible in it. Kids being targeted or releasing chemical agents. There is always something. War in and of itself is terrible. If she burns a couple thousand people to save the seven kingdoms then so be it.

4. That bitch saved the world. Period. If she didn’t have her army and dragons the night king would have killed them all. He would have decimated the entire lot then killed bran. Her involvement has been tantamount to success for these characters and they want to usurp her. She should kill them all and start from scratch. None of them are innocent at this point.

5. Nothing that she has done is illogical. She is reacting to the people around her. If she becomes “mad” is it because her advisors betrayed her and the people she literally sacrificed her children for despise her. That would make me a little “mad” too.",22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bl6ouz/on_a_scale_of_110_with_10_being_the_highest_how/,2019-05-06 07:01:13
245,b9kaa2,"Why, in my opinion, Daenerys will have to face the choice of bending the knee.","In view of the latest leaks, I have thought a little more about season 7.

Many people think that the death of Tarlys is there to create an useless drama early in the season but will be quickly resolved. They also think  that the insistence about Daenerys’ infertility is there to announce a future pregnancy.

&#x200B;

But let’s resume the facts as they are and not as people interpret them:

Daenerys  burned the Tarlys because they refused to bend in front of her, to recognize her as the true queen of Westeros. She also keeped Jon prisoner (that is to say Jon thinks to be a prisoner at the beginning) and demanded that he bend the knee to respect the oath of a Stark made to a Targaryen. Daenerys wants to restore house Targaryen and thinks she is the last of her lineage. She is also absolutely convinced of being barren (that you think the opposite doesn't count, only matter what the characters think / know). Tyrion repeatedly told her that she should name a successor so that, even if she dies in a battle, those who follow her may continue to live and pursue her ideal of a better world. But Daenerys has always refused to talk about it until she will be on the iron throne, sweeping away what will happen to her people if she is not there anymore.

&#x200B;

In season 8, Jon will learn that he is the legitimate heir to the iron throne. Therefore, Daenerys will have to bend the knee before her nephew to follow her own rule: she keeps repeating that it is necessary to follow the legitimate Targaryen's heir. Jon is the eldest, the brother’s son whom she idealizes. He bears the name Targaryen and will be able to pass it on to his children since, unlike her, he will be able to perpetuate the Targaryen lineage.  Finally, Daenerys has come to know Jon, she loves him and respects him.  She knows that he is a good person and a good king.

&#x200B;

**This is actually the ultimate test for Daenerys.**

Will she respect her own word? If she wants to build a better world, restore  the Targaryen house and respect the order of succession, she must bend  the knee in front of her nephew.

He is a good man who will make Westeros a better place. Northern people already elected him their king (contrary to Daenerys who has no followers from Westeros). He can marry and have children. And he's first in the succession. Daenerys is barren (which makes any marriage \*with him or another\* useless), she is 2nd in the order of succession and doesn’t know Westeros. Leave the throne to her nephew and let him marry a woman who can give him heirs, that would show the  woman she is. Moreover, the North doesn’t want her. What kind of  “savior” is she if she continues to impose herself on a people when they  have elected the true king of the country?

But if Daenerys doesn’t  want to give up the throne, if she refuses to do the same thing that caused the Tarly to be killed, then that will mean she wants power and is no different from those who preceded her.

&#x200B;

I'm not saying it's going to happen. Simply that the execution of the Tarly, the insistence about her infertility, about her appointment of an heir and the words of Sam on the fact that Daenerys should bend the knee are there to put Daenerys face to this test.

She can learn that she is pregnant afterwards if that's what D & D want. But for now, I think the show wants her to make a decision based on these criteria to determine who she has become. Daenerys has always had a dark side as well as a good heart. But these decisions led her down a darker path. She must therefore be faced to this choice. She must finally make a decision to determine what she wants to be.",160,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/b9kaa2/why_in_my_opinion_daenerys_will_have_to_face_the/,2019-04-05 04:02:56

247,a4p2qu,Cat wasn't an evil step-mom to Jon and Jon didn't have a shitty childhood,">**GRRM:""Mistreatment"" is a loaded word. Did Catelyn beat Jon bloody? No. Did she distance herself from him? Yes. Did she verbally abuse and attack him? No. (The instance in Bran's bedroom was obviously a very special case). But I am sure she was very protective of the rights of her own children, and in that sense always drew the line sharply between bastard and trueborn where issues like seating on the high table for the king's visit were at issue.**  
>  
>**And Jon surely knew that she would have preferred to have him elsewhere.**

Guys, Cat wasn't some evil step-mom to Jon. She didn't like him and he knew she didn't like him but she shouldn't be forced to love him. He's not her kid and she didn't raise him.

He knew she wanted him somewhere else but she didn't maltreat him. She wasn't willing to be his mom though and saw Jon as a threat to them by virtue of being raised like a Stark, looking like Ned Stark and potentially being the son of the woman that Ned potentially loved more than her.

But she never took steps to deliberately hurt him(except once) or try to kill him. She was just cold to him and made certain that people knew he wasn't a Stark but a bastard.

Yes, Jon resents her for it and she does cast a shadow over his life but she didn't make his life miserable.

You want to see a cruel ""step-mother"", go to Cersei Lannister and what she would have done if Jon was Robert's:

&#x200B;

>""I glimpsed him once at Winterfell,"" the queen said, ""though the Starks did their best to hide him. He looks very like his father."" Her husband's by-blows had his look as well, though at least Robert had the grace to keep them out of sight. **Once, after that sorry business with the cat, he had made some noises about bringing some baseborn daughter of his to court. ""Do as you please,"" she'd told him, ""but you may find that the city is not a healthy place for a growing girl."" The bruise those words had won her had been hard to hide from Jaime, but they heard no more about the bastard girl.** **Catelyn Tully was a mouse, or she would have smothered this Jon Snow in his cradle. Instead, she's left the filthy task to me.**

&#x200B;

And Jon Snow didn't have some shitty childhood. He didn't grow up a peasant or poor or on the run. Daenerys and Viserys are the ones with the shitty childhoods. Jon literally grew up with what we would term as part of the 1% in society. He grew up in a huge castle, he always had food, he grew up with an education, he received training in arms, he got to dance with noble ladies, he had a father plus siblings that loved him and he was most likely being prepared to hold some land someday by Ned. Yeah, he has a chip on his shoulder because of Cat and being a bastard but relatively speaking to the rest of society, he had it made.

&#x200B;

Jon also had it really good, he literally grew up spoiled and the first part of his development is about growing out of that:

&#x200B;

>""They're not my brothers,"" Jon snapped. ""They hate me because I'm better than they are.""  
>  
>""**No. They hate you because you act like you're better than they are. They look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he's a lordling."" The armorer leaned close. ""You're no lordling. Remember that. You're a Snow, not a Stark. You're a bastard and a bully**.""  
>  
>""A bully?"" Jon almost choked on the word. The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away. ""They were the ones who came after me. Four of them.  
>  
>""**Four that you've humiliated in the yard. Four who are probably afraid of you. I've watched you fight. It's not training with you. Put a good edge on your sword, and they'd be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it. You leave them nothing. You shame them. Does that make you proud?**""  
>  
>Jon hesitated. He did feel proud when he won. Why shouldn't he? But the armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong. ""They're all older than me,"" he said defensively.  
>  
>""**Older and bigger and stronger, that's the truth. I'll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though. Who was he, some old knight**?""  
>  
>""Ser Rodrik Cassel,"" Jon said warily. There was a trap here. He felt it closing around him.  
>  
>**Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon's face. ""Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword."" His look was grim. ""So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?**""  
>  
>""Don't call me that!"" Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty. ""I never … I didn't think …""

They call him Lord Snow because he's a spoiled bastard that thinks he's better than everyone else. That's how the name is first attached to him.

Even in the show Melisandre points out that Jon had it way better than most people and Jon acknowledges that she's right.

>**Jon Snow: When we had feasts, our family would sit up here and I would sit down there.**  
>  
>**Melisandre: It could've been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family, you had feasts.**  
>  
>**Jon Snow: Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.**

258,bobfym,Unpopular opinion: Dany's descent is portrayed fine in the show,"The episode immediately before the siege of King's Landing, she watches one of her best friends and supporters from the very beginning get beheaded mercilessly on top of the wall as her hand and brother of the queen begged for Mercy.

Prior to that, she watched as it was abundantly clear that nobody in Westeros really cares for her. They care for Jon and Jon's choice to support her, or they care about King's Landing, but they don't care about her the way the people did in Essos when they were freed. She saw her child dragon shot (stupid, I know) by Cersei's army. 

Prior even to that, she had seen in Essos what happens when you allow the former power structure to remain in place, despite ""liberating"" the people. She saw how the former slaves could never live in peace in their own city, and they would never really let the former masters live in peace either. 

Then, she sat and saw the city surrendering. King's Landing, this symbol of all Westeros stands for, was going to abdicate, but it would never truly have been hers. The heart of those people would never support her, and she knew as much based on how Tyrion described how easily they would turn on Cersei. This was the city that turned on her father. The bells were ringing, and the battle was over.

Then, Missandei's last words rang through her head: ""Dracarys"". Missandei, who formerly had showed nothing but compassion, didn't hesitate to tell Dany to burn it all down. Her snapping wasn't just her going mad - it was based on 8 seasons of seeing what happens when you give people second chances. She was not going to give this city that chance again.

Well, I'm back. And I watched episode 3. One thing's for sure, this is easily the darkest episode of Game of Thrones I've ever seen. Just imagine Shireen's burning if it was a full length episode.

&#x200B;

After being requested a summary so many times, I've finally done it:

\- the episode starts with daenerys sucking on tormund's tits

\- gendry forges a new dick for theon

\- missandei cheats on greyworm with varys in the crypts

\- bran wargs into sam and rides ghost into battle

\- night king dies, and beric brings him back to life with melisandre

\- the hound gets burned alive

\- tyrion comes out as a transgender

\- jorah shoots down rhaegal with jon on it 

\- sam runs away

\- arya kills gendry to assert dominance over lyanna mormont

Why?Because she was simply annoying.Had she been just naive then i would not mind her but she was also stupid and arrogant.

Fast forward 7 seasons later and i can safely say that her story is a showcase of masterful character development.

Sansa has been through a lot,probably she is one of the most hurt character,but she never gave up.She survived,learnt and persevered.

Now she is strong enough to not give up.She is clever enough to not be fooled by anyone but fool everyone.She is kind enough to rule a kingdom.All in all,she isbthe one true queen in the north.

I mean, I don’t mind shitposts.. most of the time it’s entertaining and some are really good. 
But the OTP wars need to stop. Jonsa vs Jonerys vs Sansan vs whoeverthefuck is getting sooooo fucking annoying. You don’t need to shit on a character or a couple just because you like another, it’s not how it works. Each character has a role in the show and they all bring something. If you’re a real fan, you should be satisfied with the ending of each character as long as it makes sense. 
Of course it’s even worse when it goes from OTP wars to real life couples!!!! I was going through a couple of redditors’ history and realized some people actually hate Rose because she *stole* Kit from Emilia?????? and that Rose is a whore and only uses Kit for fame?????? WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK????? Do you realize Rose has a career? She’s on The Good Fight right now, it’s real good show and she’s one the fucking main character on it. Can you imagine grown ups discussing things like that on the internet? Your life must be really sad. When you’re a 12 years old, it’s already bad but ""understandable"" because you’re young and stupid but not when you’re a fucking adult.

296,bdrmu2,"I’m just going to point this out but a ban on people posting Notre Dame memes for being ‘too soon’ and ‘bad taste’ is ridiculously not in the spirit of the ethos of this sub, and I don’t even find these memes funny myself.","I’m sure the mod ban was instigated because of frequency and a lack or loose relevance to GOT and I would always support this decision because without that, the sub would become swamped by irrelevant and repetitive shit. 

What concerns me most is the very vocal section of our community who think this decision should be upheld on the grounds that such memes are ‘too soon’, ‘bad taste’, ‘mocking a national tragedy’, ‘not funny’ - or more specifically, upsetting people.  No deaths have been reported as yet, so are we now being sensitive to those affected by a national tragedy, Emmanuel Macron, or...erm, people who like churches and history? 

I’ve never visited Notre Dame and always wanted to and I’m gutted by what I’ve seen but my feelings on this have no relevance here. Meme away and I’ll ignore you. 

This is freefolk. Anything besides racial abuse, very specific political views and targeted harassment and insults, is pretty much fair game. The place is operated on quite consistent libertarian principles.

So can I be clear about this? If a Notre Dame meme is fresh and new and not a repost of a similar one (hard to see what you could do with it but there’s always the possibility - necessity is the mother of invention after all) then it should be allowed, yes? It’s not contravening any rules? 

Is it going to be upsetting to some people? Yeah, I’m sure it will be but that’s not reason to remove it or ban the person who posted it. If it’s not liked, leave it to others to downvote it into oblivion. 

Should memes be banned because they’re not funny? Who is policing that now? I don’t think they’re funny but then I don’t find most of the the memes on here that funny - shall we remove them because I think they’re not funny? 

I guess my post here is calling for a bit of clarity and is not really directed at the mods, but what I think is a growing sub-section if this community who really aren’t comfortable with freefolk and want to slowly change it into something else.

297,9k9xq7,A half-hearted defense of Sansa not telling Jon about the Knights of the Vale,"*cracks knuckles* Let's do this. 

First I'd like to say that Sansa not telling Jon about this whole other army was unequivocally stupid and I don't like it more now than I did watching it. Hooooowever, I do think there is an argument to be made about why Sansa withheld the information. Sansa at this point in season 6 is still a young girl who has been used and manipulated for others' pusposes ever since she left Winterfell. She was assigned to Joffrey because Bobby B still had some Freudian complex about mingling his blood with the Starks. Sure, she liked Joffrey in the beginning, but if she hadn't it wouldn't have really mattered. Then she gets used by Cersei into facilitating righteous Ned's metaphorical character death before he IRL dies. She gets married to Tyrion against her will, gets tricked by Littlefinger into helping kill Joffrey, and is then slutshamed by her crazy aunt. At nearly every point, Sansa has been betrayed by people she thought she could trust and gets used for their own agendas. 

When she and Jon meet again, she's just escaped marriage to a monster that was--you guessed it--arranged by someone she thought she could trust. She's happy to see Jon, but she doesn't really know him. We, the audience, know Jon is a righteous dude who would never use his sister for his own purposes, but she doesn't. They spent their entire childhood not getting along. And before you say it's ridiculous to think her de facto brother would betray her, her other one literally burned down her home and tried to kill her brothers. I think she genuinely believed enough people would rally to their cause without her having to become more indebted to Littlefinger. She knows by now Littlefinger doesn't do anything for free, and inviting him back into her life will come with a cost. She doesn't even ask for the army until it becomes clear they don't have enough Northerners. She deliberately eliminates Jon from the asking/negotiating process because she doesn't want him having any decision-making power over over her future. Yes, knowing what we do about Jon, it was a stupid decision. But characters in fiction making stupid, illogical decisions doesn't automatically mean bad writing because people do that shit all the time. 

Is Sansa often self-serving and powerhungry? Yep, but after all the crap she's been through she's learned that's the way the world works. ",129,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/9k9xq7/a_halfhearted_defense_of_sansa_not_telling_jon/,2018-10-01 00:57:52
298,9h98lf,The Rhaenys and Visenya of the Series are Sansa Stark and Arya Stark,"Sansa:


>She is good at this, he thought, as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that his cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown, and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first time he'd left his sickbed since the battle. He looks ghastly. Lancel's hair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick. Without his father beside him holding him up, he would surely have collapsed. Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he'd had the sense to love her. 

....

>""I will remember, Your Grace,"" said Sansa, though she had always heard that love was a surer route to the people's loyalty than fear. If I am ever a queen, I'll make them love me.

Arya:

>Arya cocked her head to one side. ""Can I be a king's councillor and build castles and become the High Septon?""

>""You,"" Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, ""will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.""Arya screwed up her face. ""No,"" she said, ""that's Sansa."" She folded up her right leg and resumed her balancing. Ned sighed and left her there.

.....

>Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had named her pup ""Lady."" Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she giggled.

Rhaenys Targaryen:

>Rhaenys, youngest of the three Targaryens, was all her sister was not: playful, curious, impulsive, given to flights of fancy. No true warrior, Rhaenys loved music, dancing, and poetry, and supported many a singer, mummer, and puppeteer. 

Visenya Targaryen:

>Visenya, eldest of the three siblings, was as much a warrior as Aegon himself, as comfortable in ringmail as in silk. She carried the Valyrian longsword Dark Sister, and was skilled in its use, having trained beside her brother since childhood. Though possessed of the silver-gold hair and purple eyes of Valyria, hers was a harsh, austere beauty. Even those who loved her best found Visenya stern, serious, unforgiving, and some said that she played with poisons and dabbled in dark sorceries.

Sansa and Rhaenys have the same interests. Music, dancing, poetry. Sansa's name means charm.

Arya and Visenya have the same interests. Poison, sorcery, fighting. Arya's name means noble.

But some of you cunts need to calm the fuck down. The things I've seen you write in posts about how you can't wait to abuse D&D at comic-con or in real life if you see them is so fucking toxic my dudes. 

Freefolk is meant to be a community of folk who are free to express their opinions on the show and the books that we love. A lot of shit posting and meming and good old fashioned fun. But you're taking what was a gag and turning it into an unhealthy obsession. Anyone who doesn't share in the hate gets ignored or called a kneeler. You're not cool being an edgy hound soundalike on Reddit being overly pessimistic and continuing to drive a point into the ground weeks after most people have kinda forgotten about game of thrones and it's finale. 

I love how so much money was raised for Kit and Emilia's foundations - those are some constructive ways we can band together as a community. We need more of that, and less *insert meme about how I hate DND because they ruined muh fantasy tv show / gonna ruin star wars because they're hacks and whatever they touch creatively is shiiiiiiit because I'm right and didn't like the last two seasons!!!!!!* 

Being a creative, especially in a spotlight to the scope of game of thrones is a stressful and hard job. Not everyone is going to be a genius savant and hit 100% of what they try to make. They make a thing and put it out to the world, and hope to god it likes it. And when it doesn't that hits hard, but it motivates them to be better. But when you start abusing people - it leaves a longer lasting impression. The human psyche is fragile and if the community continues like this I wouldn't be surprised to see more actors and creatives take their lives, because they let the people who made them down. Or more likely, a fan motivated by hate gunning them down in the street or at a con  because only they know how the fantasy show should be and darn those pesky writers. 

Turn your ideas into something constructive. Write your own series if you think you have better story ideas. Use this as motivation to make the thing you wanted yourself. 

TL;dr 
Some of the community out here acting like Mark David Chapman first being longtime fans of the content and ""snapping"" when a perceived slight happens and looking like they gonna gun down D&D in an alleyway. Turn the emotion into a positive. Keep supporting charities. Keep the community healthy and not negative. Be creative.

306,b0f9r4,Unpopular opinion: the show doesn't know how to create powerful female characters,"They portray powerful women as cold,distant,cynical and all of them have fucking smug face everytime they kill somebody

How can all these different women act in the same way?

All these women are powerful but what make them powerful Is their differences


Book Ellaria is a grieving women who wish a proper burial for oberyn rather than vengeance she is a pacifist who see no reasons for more bloodshed. then the show made her info the complete opposite if her character


Show ellaria is bitter,hateful and ready to kill her lover's familly to satisfy her need first revenge she also killed children which is a complète heresy for a martell

This is maybe the only time i share and understood asoaif's rage after season 5

Ellaria's strengh is her compassion and wisdom


Dany? well i think they are wasting Emilia Clark's potential with their scripts...because emilia's personality is closer to how Dany is in the books

Book Dany is a bit like margeary she is a jovial person,extremely charismatic ,curious ,passionate and charming in a almost child-like way

She can also be also be hot tempered direct and cold but only when her ennemies go too far

She follow sun tzu's philosophy with her ennemies

""Appear strong when you are weak and weak when you are strong""

She will use her charm to act dumb and inexperienced by saying things like "" i am just a girl"" or ask her advisor for some clarifications and caugh them off guard


Her attitude during her first meeting with Jon is just wrong and out of character no mater how foolish Jon look Dany would never be rude and so easily triggered .book Dany would try to charm him or propose a drink,a walk or a dinner and indirecly threaten him 


Book Dany can balance.both warmth and coldness,show Dany can only do it on rare occasions


Sansa? Well some people who knows me on that sub already know my opinion on sansa so i will not make a 
Rant about her

Just one thing ...
her opinion on the case of alys karstark and ned umber is beyond bullshit and out of character

Sansa endured many beating and humilations because she was tge daughter of X and sister if Y

She would never wish the same on ned and alys



Yara aka ""asha"" ? Huge character in books,secondary characters on the show barely had any devellopment...next



Arya? Oh boi...she is portrayed as a sociopathic ninja assassins...some will tell tell that this is awesome,i say that it was never try point of her character


Just like sansa she is a broken girl who watch her familly died one by one and had to survive in a wild and dangerous world

Yes she does have sadistic tendencies but that does not make her the psycho



Cersei is their best job without a doubt but what will be her conclusion? We'll see

307,9gu2fm,Jon is ice and fire fullstop,"Were it the actual intention to make Jon nothing more than ice and for that to meet Dany’s fire as an equal balancing force, there’s … literally no reason at all … to make Jon also a Targaryen. Just make him Ned’s bastard and be done with it. Nothing Jon’s done so far has required him to be a Targaryen. The only reason to make him Stark/Targaryen is if the intent was for the ice and fire balance to exist within one person.

So my answer is that Jon represents both ice and fire as a matter of balance, while Dany represents the fire extremity (as the Others represent the ice extremity).

But that's not what I'm talking about here.

318,bjqudi,A list of every problem I have with Arya being the one to kill the Night King.,"I**.	Problems I have with the logistics of the event itself.**


1.That it took Melisandre basically telling Arya that it would be a good idea to kill the Night King in order for Arya to come to the realization that it would be a good idea to kill the Night King. If Mel hadn’t said “blue eyes” what would Arya have done? She’s been in the war council meetings, she knows that the living’s best chance to win is to kill the Night King. Her realizing she has the capability to kill the main antagonist just because another character reminds her of her ability is bad writing, in my opinion.  The good guys win just because they realize they can win. 

Compare that to the ending of Harry Potter where Harry wins because the end culmination of a plan that took several years of planning and foresight to accomplish, his own willingness to meet his own death willingly and the actions of characters even outside his power to influence.

They even changed the order of which Mel said the original phrase back in Season 3 just to suit the episode’s needs, putting greater emphasis on “Blue Eyes” by putting it at the end instead of the middle.  It was never intended to be foreshadowing other than foreshadowing Arya’s rise as a trained killer; which wouldn’t happen for another two seasons. 


2.If Mel had realized back in season 3 that Arya had a role to play in defeating the Night King there’s NO WAY she just lets Arya walk free with the Brotherhood Without Banners. Melisandre is a character that is obsessed with finding Azor Ahai. If she knew Arya was a character that had a role to play in defeating the “Great Other”, she would have brought her back to Dragonstone. 

And if she just realized that Arya was the one to kill the Night King while in Winterfell, that’s still just a plot device to instigate Arya into action and, in my opinion, lazy writing that wasn’t set up previously. 


Whatever, though. Although its unrealistic, I can stomach the idea that all the White Walkers were focused on Bran and the Night King that they didn’t realize Arya was sneaking by them. My problems more so lie with the implications on the story as a whole. 

**II.	Problems I have with Arya being the one to kill the Night King**

1.Arya was just introduced into this plotline two episodes before. 
	

This isn’t her plot. From the moment this plot was introduced, 23 years ago in print and eight years ago on television, this has been Jon’s story. 
	

His entire plot and character arc has been about putting aside his own wants and desires in order to fight the White Walkers. Originally, he wants to leave the Night’s Watch to help Robb fight in the war. He doesn’t because Jeor convinces him that all that stuff is inconsequential to the Great War. He takes the risk of his men hating him after his election as Lord Commander because he knows he HAS to save the Free Folk. 
	

To have Jon not make a meaningful difference in the final fight just doesn’t seem right. 


This was Jon’s story to help finish and he didn’t contribute to the final in any meaningful way. I feel the same way about this as I would if Han Solo was the one to kill to Darth Vader in return of the Jedi or Hermione killed Voldemort in Deathly Hallows.  No one denies Arya is a character who has had her skills built up over the course of the show, it’s about letting stories and plot lines finish in a way that is fitting to all characters. 


2.Bran’s story arc is mostly pointless now


Why was Bran chosen to become the next three-eyed raven by Brynden Rivers? It’s built up that Bran has a part to play in the war for the Dawn but the biggest contribution he makes is allowing the previous three eyed-raven to be defeated by allowing the Night King to touch him. If the OG 3ER wasn’t in any danger without Bran fucking up, what was the point of calling Bran to be the next 3ER anyway? What role did he play in the great defeat of the White Walkers other than being bait?


3.Why was Jon resurrected?


Only two people have been resurrected by R’hllor, why is Jon so special that he was allowed to return?


The most common response I’ve seen is that Jon did serve a purpose by bringing the North together, to which I say: Did he really?


He didn’t rescue Sansa from Winterfell, Theon did. Sansa could be the rallying point behind the other Northern houses, as the trueborn heir to the Stark name while the entire Realm believing Bran dead. In the books, there is a plan to free the girl who the Northern Lords believe is Arya for precisely the same reason. Sansa could easily have been the cause of the Northern Rebellion against the Boltons. 


He also didn’t win the Battle of the Bastards, he was nearly the one who lost it. He blew their battle tactics and nearly cost them the victory. Sansa’s Knights of the Vale were the only reason that they ended up retaking Winterfell. 


It’s true that he brought Dany to help aid the North, but without Jon getting Dany’s help, the Night King would have never received a dragon in the first place. The argument could be made that Jon did more to endanger the living’s chances of survival than ensure it. 


And regardless of these points above, the combined forces of Stark, Targaryen, Free Folk etc were not enough to beat the Night King. The White Walkers were going to win until Arya killed the Night King. If the end result was always going to be dictated by Arya and Arya alone, then Jon uniting the combined forces didn’t play a huge role in the outcome of the battle. This begs the question of what purpose he was resurrected for if he was not going to be a deciding factor.


4.Why were the White Walkers built up as an apocalyptic threat?  


If Arya, a person with one year of Faceless Man training, could kill the Night King, it stands to reason that any Faceless Man worth his weight in gold could also kill the Night King.


In the books, it is hinted that the Long Night reached as far as Yi-ti. If the Long Night was never going to get past Braavos (or whenever someone hired a Faceless Man) why were we ever worried about the White Walkers taking over the world? 


5.Azor Ahai


Others have already written about this at length but there has been 23 years of book theorizing and eight seasons of the show that established the Azor Ahai prophecy as significant. 


I’ve seen a lot of people say “well it’s too show that in the World of Ice and Fire you can’t” trust prophecies.  This is absolutely untrue. 

a.	Cersei’s volnqar prophecy is very close to being completed. 

b.	Jojen’s visions of the future constantly come to fruiton. 

c.	Patchface’s prophecies come true

d.	Several of Dany’s visions in the House of the Undying have become true or will likely become true

e.	The Ghost of High Heart accurately predicts both the Red Wedding and the Purple Wedding 

I’ve seen some people claim that prophecies, chiefly Azor Ahai, have been diminished in the show. While this is true to a point, we still have Melisandre, who is entirely motivated by prophecy and Stannis’ motivations were largely concerned with this belief that he was the Prince Who Was Promised.


Why have Jon, a character who would shun the Iron Throne, be of the same bloodline of Rhaegar Targaryen without making the prophecy concerning Rhagear’s bloodline relevant? Jon is quite literally a mixing of Ice and Fire, it seems reasonable that the story's overarching plot belongs to him. 


Subverting 7 seasons of foreshadowing just for the sake of subverting them is cheap and bad writing.  


**III.	Problems I have with finishing that plotline now.** 

1.For seven seasons and five books, the ASOIAF has been building to the battle with the White Walkers. Its been the marketing of all the latest seasons. It was the first chapter in the books, and the first scene in the show. It is the longest running plot in the show. I don’t think it could have been resolved entirely in Episode 3 without feeling anti-climatic.  

There’s a reason that the original work is titled A Song of Ice and Fire; the final conflict of this series was always going to be the clash with the White Walkers. GRRM implies as much in the series original manuscript saying: 

“The greatest danger of all, however, comes from the north, from the icy wastes beyond the Wall, where half-forgotten demons out of legend, the inhuman others, raise cold legions of the undead and the neverborn and prepare to ride down on the winds of winter to extinguish everything that we would call ‘life.’ The only thing that stands between the Seven Kingdoms and an endless night is the Wall, and a handful of men in black called the Night's Watch. Their story will be the heart of my third volume, The Winds of Winter. The final battle will also draw together characters and plot threads left from the first two books and resolve all in one huge climax.”


In the books, (and I thought in the show) It was clear that the last great fight always going to be the battle with the White Walkers. One of the major themes in the books is how the Iron Throne as a political institution creates nothing but conflict, war and death especially for the common folk. Westeros is constant turmoil, the lands are ruined, and the series breeds characters with severe mental trauma. Like Dany says in season 6, it’s a wheel that rotates, this person is on top then the other the ones that truly suffer are the ones below the wheel, the common folk. Jorah once said that common folk pray for rain and a summer that never ends, not who is occupying the throne in a throne room they’ll never see. To see the show shift back to fighting who is on the Iron Throne is disheartening. 


In general, I don’t think there was anyone way to not have the conflict with the Long Night not feel anti-climatic other than, you know, maybe not having the living win in the very clash of the allied living forces and the Dead? 


**IV.	Problems I have with making Cersei the final villain** 

1.For starters, I think its very difficult to go from fighting the living embodiment of death to a snarky drunk politician and still keeping the same amount of heightened tension. 


2.I don’t think the show can do political intrigue as well it could in seasons 1-4. 


3.Another problem with going back to the shows political roots after building up the fantasy elements of the story is that most of the the characters are so powerful that they cant reasonably exist in a plot of politics without creating natural plot holes.

Dany and Jon now have two dragons. Aegon the Conqueror conquered seven separate kingdoms because he had a small army and three dragons. Dany and Jon need to take one city. They could finish this anytime. 

Arya just assassinated an immortal ice god why couldn’t she just infiltrate King’s Landing at any time and kill Cersei?


Bran was already the most powerful warg in Westeros in thousands of years and is now the three-eyed raven. Whats to stop him from warging into Cersei and forcing her to jump out a window? 


Sure they could want to win “the right way” but it still removes a significant amount of tension if at any point it gets too tough, they have several ways they can almost immediately pull out a victory. 


4.Going back to the show’s roots as a political drama would be a lot more forgivable if Cersei had been portrayed as anything close to a formidable political in any of the prior 7 seasons. 


Her inability to control Joffrey leads to the Lannisters being forcibly entered into the War of Five Kings.


Her petty rivalry with Margaery forces her to give power to the Faith Militant, plunging the realm into chaos and creating her own enemy. 

In the words of Tywin, she’s not as smart as she thinks she is. 

5.But JesusHShuttlesworth, it’s supposed to be like the Scouring of the Shire don’t you GET IT?!?

The difference is that Scouring of the Shire comes after the climax of the Lord of the Rings. There’s real loss and emotional turmoil caused by the heroes succeeding. 

At the beginning of the Long Night, our characters are much the same as they are at the end of it. Jon didn’t lose anyone close to him, his character isn’t changed in any significant way. 


We have all but two “main” characters survive, which cheapens the threat that the White Walkers posed. Yes thousands do die but theyre all nameless faces. Imagine if at the Battle of Hogwarts only Colin Creevey died. The triumph over Voldemort would have a lot less emotional weight to it, wouldn’t it? 


 Dany is the one character who SHOULD be changed the most by the outcome of the Long Night. She just lost her oldest friend and closest confidant. She reasonably should be shaken by this. She doesn’t appear to be though, which brings me to my next point. 


Having to go back to the Shire and still deal with the problems there comes with this melancholy tone of “No rest for the weary.” Nobody wants to keep fighting, but they have to.  


Compare that with the tone of the Episode 4 preview where Danaerys is leading a cheer and everyone is toasting her and now everyone is more than happy to keep fighting for the iron throne now that the distraction of the worst threat to humanity in human history is defeated. 


6.It also goes against ASOIAF’s theme of being an Anti-war story. Throughout the books and the show, it’s been said and shown that what matters the most is the Great War, not petty politics. And eventually characters like Jon, Tormund, and Dany all put aside their differences to focus on it. To have them immediately, and so willingly, go march off to war again is just such a leap from where they’ve been as characters and what this story’s themes are. In ASIOAF, the politics of the quest for the Iron Throne are a distraction from what really matters, the fight against the Long Night. In Game of Thrones, the fight against the Long Night appears to be a distraction from the quest for the iron throne.",17,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bjqudi/a_list_of_every_problem_i_have_with_arya_being/,2019-05-02 08:28:34

335,8vjuig,A time for wolves,"The idea of Jon and Sansa as a romantic pairing might sound absurd but I think it is actually far from unlikely.


The heart of it is quite simple to explain: ASOIAF is not and never will be easy on the readers. So even a positive resolution will eschew looking like a happy ending at every cost. And Jon/Sansa as the endgame will be everything but easy to the readers.


*


Working on the assumption here that most of the readers wish these two characters well - wishing them the best possible happy ending that their world can realistically provide, perhaps even wishing that they’ll get what they desire in life - I’ve come to believe that Jon/Sansa has the potential to provide everyone with everything they want, except the “best” possible happy ending. But given a not even particularly specific set of circumstances it could be very easily be the “least terrible.”


And that is why I think Jon/Sansa stands a pretty good chance of happening.


There are some pre-conditions for Jon/Sansa (the aforementioned circumstances) all of them super-obvious, all of them ultimately speculative - like them being alive. It would also help for them to be single, available, in the same place at the same time - and the second greatest conjecture of all (after them being alive) - R+L=J not just being true but also being known around Westeros. 


But once that’s the case, Jon/Sansa will look like a great idea to nearly everyone in the story while being a completely unforeseen turn of events to the readers. It’s surprising yet obvious - the definition of a good plot twist. 


*


But then surprising but obvious is very much the modus operandi for Jon and Sansa in relation to each other.


Because, just as surprisingly, they are fairly similar characters. Disguised by the fact that they face vastly different challenges, these challenges reveal similar character arcs, similar characteristics and even similar wants and desires. They are in many ways two sides of the same coin. 


They start out in the same place, not just geographically, but psychologically. They both believe in the songs, in the heroes of those songs, and that life is just waiting to make Aemon the Dragonknight (Jon) or his lady love, Queen Naerys, (in the case of Sansa) out of them.


And as they go in opposite directions geographically, they undergo the same disillusioning journey as they are soon forced to face the same harsh reality. And from there on their journeys partially become the mirror images of each other: Sansa goes from Lady Stark to Lady Lannister to bastard (which she models to some degree after Jon) while simultaneously Jon goes from Jon Snow to Jon Stark (according to Robb‘s will, even if Jon doesn‘t know it yet) to Lord Commander. 


But other parts of those journeys aren’t even mirrored but completely similar. Sansa has to pretend she wants nothing to do with her previous life while being a prisoner in King’s Landing and Jon has to do exactly the same while being with the wildlings. “Fake it ‘till you make it” seems also the motto that accompanies them on their journeys with Jon being tempted to stay with the wildlings and Sansa trying to actively forget that she isn’t Alayne Stone.


But as all of this happens, as they are both forced to lose their idealism to deal with choices that puts them between rocks and hard places, as they have to grieve for their family, as they even try to become other people, they both still cling to the concept of justice, of fairness, of doing the right thing, of erring on the side of compassion. They both try and sometimes fail to remain decent people.


Jon’s acts of decency are active and often easily supported by rational argument, like letting the wildlings in and saving Gilly’s child.


Sansa, being condemned to passivity by her situation, cannot often be active with whatever she is doing (saving Dontos is the rare exception) and thus the generosity of her passive actions seems to want to make up for it. In a seemingly self-negating, saintly way she even prays for her enemies:

 

Sansa knew most of the hymns, and followed along on those she did not know as best she could. She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives, with serving girls and soldiers, cooks and falconers, knights and knaves, squires and spit boys and nursing mothers. She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without, sang with all the city. She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, for her sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall. She sang for her mother and her father, for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully, for her friend Jeyne Poole, for old drunken King Robert, for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel and Maester Luwin, for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today, and for the children and the wives who would mourn them, and finally, toward the end, she even sang for Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound. 


(Compare that prayer to one of Arya’s lists which are all about who she’s gonna murder and you get an idea of how outrageous hers is.)


But Sansa’s list of people she prays for during the Battle of Blackwater isn’t as super-forgiving as it looks. Suspiciously missing are Cersei, Joffrey, most of the Kingsguard, and other assorted, certified douchebags. Because Sansa is sensible enough to not forgive those who have harmed her. Her generous compassion becomes a problem for her because she isn’t very often correct in her assessment of people. Just like Jon (Bowen Marsh being a case in point.)


That doesn’t mean they are saints by any stretch of imagination. They are both flawed, naive, still, to some degree, selfish, short-sighted and selectively blind. 


Both have repeatedly trusted the wrong people and probably for the same reason - life has killed their idealism but not their predisposition to see the good in people. Or to just passively accepting the bad and getting hurt for it. 


It’s not necessarily that they’re overly trusting, it’s just that they have been both wrong on memorable occasions to believe that certain people wouldn’t actively harm them.  (They also have been right on that account though.) But that baseline trust/selective blindness is the reason why Sansa is wanted for regicide, Tyrion‘s wife, and Littlefinger‘s bastard daughter instead of chilling with Willas Tyrell in Highgarden, while Jon is chilling with a few knives in his back.


*


Of course, being similar people doesn’t make them likely to happen or anything. It’s an interesting factoid that makes it easier to explain why them being with each other might not be worst of ideas, character-wise, but it’s not decisive. What is decisive is that is the perfect ironic twist, that it’s “be careful what you wish for” for Sansa, for Jon, for the audience.


*


“Everything you want, in the worst possible way.” This is an extremely important element of good storytelling, and I find myself surprised I haven’t talked about it before. Giving the audience everything they want, while stabbing them in the eyes at the same time, […is] one of our storytelling staples…“ - Jane Espenson


*


Sansa, the eleven-year old dreamer, who wished to be part of a song, wished for a valiant knight to make her his lady love, idealized Aemon the Dragonknight’s love affair with Queen Naerys (making it a fairy tale when it very likely wasn’t) wished for all that and defined all these idealized men as heroes.


What Jon will be like near the end of the series - if R+L=J is real and merely a quarter of the fandom’s predictions regarding Jon’s fate come true - is absolutely everything eleven-year old Sansa wanted. And Jon’s ""song” will make Aemon the Dragonknight’s look like child’s play. He will literally the hero from the song.


We, the audience, know the dirty, depressing reality behind that song and so will every character in the books, but this “song” removed from that reality as it will be in Westeros a few generations down the line, has all the markings of a fairy tale - Cinderella and King Arthur all rolled up in one.


So Jon could be absolutely everything eleven-year old Sansa once wanted. Valiant knight, hero, and even in a way the prince from a fairy tale.


And then he wouldn’t just fit naive Sansa’s idea of a hero but also disillusioned Sansa’s (the one she thinks leaves the world without heroes.) And there is not and never will be a single other character in ASOIAF who can do the same: 

 

Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head. But a voice inside her whispered, There are no heroes…


—-


“I will not hang him,” said Jon. “Bring him here.” “Oh, Seven save us,” he heard Bowen Marsh cry out. The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, “Edd, fetch me a block,” and unsheathed Longclaw.

 

(I’m not saying that Sansa cannot adjust her definition of hero again. But right now, Jon is Sansa’s only hero.)


But just like getting that pony when you’re 80 that you wished for when you were 8 is completely not what you want anymore, getting Jon, despite being all Sansa has ever wished for in a husband, might not going to be a dream come true for Sansa. 


First of all, she has moved beyond fairy tales. Second, even more obviously - what will look like a fairy tale a few generations down the line, is ugly, drenched in blood and takes place on a continent that will be ruined by an endless war and The Others. The reader might be aware that Sansa’s childish dreams have come true but Sansa won’t probably even remember what being a child was like.


Same goes for Jon’s not-so-childish dreams. Of course, on the surface, the only thing that Sansa has that he has ever shown interest in is red hair, but a closer look at his fantasy about Val and lording over Winterfell, is pretty revealing:


I would need to steal her if I wanted her love, but she might give me children. I might someday hold a son of my own blood in my arms. A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of, since he decided to live his life on the Wall. I could name him Robb. Val would want to keep her sister’s son, but we could foster him at Winterfell, and Gilly’s boy as well. Sam would never need to tell his lie. We’d find a place for Gilly too, and Sam could come visit her once a year or so. Mance’s son and Craster’s would grow up brothers, as I once did with Robb.


He wanted it, Jon knew then. He wanted it as much as he had ever wanted anything. I have always wanted it, he thought, guiltily. 


It’s a pretty picture he paints here but what doesn’t really feature is Val, as we and Jon know her. Jon dreams pretty blatantly about recreating the Winterfell of his childhood, with the wildling children taking his place, his son taking Robb’s place and he himself becoming Ned. But he doesn’t dream about a wildling princess who walks 500 miles uphill through Other-infested territory, a warrior queen, or even a mother of dragons here. The space for the imaginary Mrs. Snow is entirely shaped by Catelyn (the only mother Jon has ever known), and how he wishes Catelyn would have been.


He imagines Val primarily as a mother and caregiver. Romantic love is a side-effect and not one Jon even appears to desire, describing stealing Val to be loved by her in a way that seems like it is too much of an effort. Her heroics, her independence, her qualities as anything but a mother never get a place in Jon’s fantasies.


And ironically, as Jon disregards Val’s personality in order to make his fantasy work, his fantasy is shared by hardly any female character whose point of view we have seen. (Westerosi girls are action girls.) The dream of quiet domesticity is something that we’ve seen only one character seriously fantasizing about as a possible and desirable future:

 

She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in their laps, or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while they floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge. If I give him sons, he may come to love me. She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon, and raise them all to be as valiant as Ser Loras. And to hate Lannisters, too. In Sansa’s dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya.

 

Sansa’s fantasy about Willas Tyrell is truly the missing half of Jon’s fantasy. They both want sons, they both think that love is secondary to marriage itself and requires effort. (I guess Ned and Catelyn’s relationship might have planted that idea.) And between Jon and Sansa’s fantasies they have the whole set of imaginary sons and daughters to replace their dead and missing siblings. There’s Robb, Arya, Bran, Rickon, and even a Ned. Interestingly enough only they themselves are missing.


And it’s with those children Sansa’s dream reveals itself to be Jon’s (plus puppies and a boat (but she’s thirteen, so what?)) - that it’s about Winterfell and their family just like they used to be. Replacing their parents with themselves to recreate their childhood. 


The thing about Jon wanting this, having always wanted it, is that there is only one girl who knows what the Winterfell of his childhood was like and who honestly wants the same thing and is not yearning for adventure, vengeance, a throne, or power above all.


And just like Jon is the only hero left for Sansa, Sansa is the only person who fits that bill. (And if Sansa’s interactions with the problem-child known as Sweetrobin are anything to go by, then she has real potential to be a great mother one day and as such would be indeed the sort of mother Jon always wished Catelyn would have been.)


*


As for the reader, the readership will be largely fine with R+L=J. After all Jon is the closest thing the series has to a traditional hero. Regardless of his heritage, fandom expects dragon riding and Others-defeating and getting the Iron Throne or something. And the ones who don’t “because GRRM is always subverting expectations and tropes - or should be” are usually so well-versed in those tropes that they know and accept Jon as a secret Targaryen as a real possibility. The former type of reader will easily and happily swallow R+L=J if it is revealed and the latter will complain that it’s lame because they have guessed it all along. 


But what the readers have in common is that they think it inevitable that Jon is going to be special because the narrative has done everything to convince them that he will be. Anything else would be an epic letdown. For that reason alone, him being a Targaryen would probably please a lot of people.


But here’s a fun idea - what if Jon is a Targaryen not just in the way that pleases (dragon-riding, special snowflake-yness, “I predicted this since the Stone Age”) but also in the way that doesn’t? 

Because there are some fun facts about the Targaryens, about the things that are unique to them: It’s not just dragon-riding, it’s not just sporadically-appearing madness, it’s also voluntary sibling incest. (Yes, let’s talk about that.)


In at least three cases, that we know of, Targaryen sibling incest has been not just voluntary but also politically absolutely pointless (Aemon the Dragonknight/Queen Naerys, Aegon IV and Daena, Bloodraven/Shiera Seastar/Bittersteel). These people didn’t bang each other (Or just indulged in some legendary public yearning. Same difference.) because it kept the blood pure. They banged each other because they wanted to bang each other and no one else would do.


These cases illustrate that Targaryens didn’t just commit incest because it was convenient or because they lacked the biological impulse not to do it. (Although they clearly lacked it in general.) They also committed incest because they were actually attracted to their siblings. 


And yet Targaryen sibling incest has served barely any purpose in the story so far. If it existed to explain an obsession with keeping the blood pure or congenital madness, cousin marriage Habsburg-style would have sufficed. (But actual Targaryen cousin marriage gets so little mention that there is only one time it is featured with characters of note. Although calling Rhaegar/Elia cousins is actually somewhat of a stretch.) Backstory-wise it has never been important. So far the only purpose it has served in the narrative is “the Targaryens are weird and that makes Jaime and Cersei less weird.” Which is not a lot, considering it’s a big, pink elephant that comes up over and over again.


Targaryen sibling incest might have been just the Chekov’s Gun for Jaime and Cersei but it’s an extremely well-developed gun, which continues to hang prominently on the wall. Perhaps too much for it to be irrelevant now. But if Jaime/Cersei was just a warning shot - the first one instead of the first and the last one - so the audience will feel safe seeing it on the wall… now that would explain why we are still getting stories and references galore to the incestuous Targaryen marriages and relationships five books and three prequel novellas later when Jaime and Cersei aren’t even a thing anymore.


If Jon/Sansa happens, GRRM can just rest on his patented troll-face and point out every single time he mentioned the Targaryen’s fondness for sibling incest as foreshadowing. And suddenly it would have a point because it narratively legitimizes Jon/Sansa. 


It also paves the way for making Jon/Sansa potentially a lot less strange to Jon and more acceptable to Westeros in general. And it would also further legitimize Jon’s claim to be a Targaryen. Jon Snow/Stark would never marry his (ex-)sister. But to Westeros, that Jon Targaryen does, goes a long way of proving that he is who he claims to be.


*


And if Jon is going to get released from the NW (a major requirement for his Targaryen-ness to matter in the first place) and marry -  his marriage will need to work on three levels in order to feel well-rounded to the audience. A personal one (it would be weird if Jon married someone he doesn’t know at all), a narrative one (the audience would need to know that character and consider them important enough), and a political one (so there would be a narrative reason for them to marry other than pulling a Game of Thrones-Talisa “let’s just do it because we feel like that” situation.)


Westeros has not many female characters who are simultaneously relevant on all three levels right now. Yet, Sansa’s relevance on every of these levels is off the charts. As a POV character, she is narratively relevant, as Jon’s family she is important on a personal level to Jon and politically, her relevance to Jon is probably even larger than they both could currently comprehend.


She is high up in line to inherit the North, the Riverlands, and Harrenhal and will be for as long either Rickon, Bran, and Edmure’s kid have not children of their own. That Sansa has potentially so much power in Westeros makes her hand in marriage literally worth killing for. And not just random people but those with a stronger claim to the North and the Riverlands. Her mere existence puts her family in danger.


Yes, we all like to imagine she’s gonna be Westeros’ Elizabeth I: Independent, Single Woman, Queen in the North and perhaps even Sansa Stark, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord (Lady?) of the Seven Kingdoms and  Protector of the Realm …. but I don’t think Sansa will be Elizabeth I. If anyone she could parallel Elizabeth of York. (At least the murdered younger brothers fit.)


I mean, I love the idea of her winning the Iron Throne in the end but I have serious doubts that it will happen. And anything less than ruling over all of Westeros would be really dangerous for Sansa and even more dangerous for anyone preceding her in the line of succession.


Just look at Littlefinger attempting to murder an easily-led child just speculating on Sansa’s claim, even though she has been disinherited, is wanted for murder and married. Unmarried Sansa would be catnip to every murderous, ambitious jerk in the realm. 


And to Jon as the guy in charge of any place where the North matters, Sansa being married to a Tywin, a Ramsay, a Victarion Greyjoy type of person would be a political problem.


I know that Dany with her three dragons/weapons of mass destruction looks like the better political option for Jon, marriage-wise. But gaining dragons is nice but not vital if Jon manages to not make enemies out of Dany or her dragons. (In which case, marriage would not be in the cards anyway.)


Not losing influence in the North, however, is vital. And every potential husband of Sansa’s would have the opportunity and motive to fuck over Jon politically. To kill whatever is left of Jon’s family. To make a second Lady Hornwood out of Sansa.


That’s why it’s so important that Sansa marries someone who isn’t a creep and who she can trust that he cares about her for a reason other than her potential inheritance. Anyone else could be deadly to her and her family. (And she’s been there, done that already.) But who can and would Sansa trust to be that person? Probably someone who she knows cared about her before she became an heiress to all that potential power. 


So actually, Jon  whether he is king or simply an landless, poor ex-Lord Commander, is her ideal political match.


Of course, if Jon survives and people know he’s Rhaegar’s son, it would give him a pretty good shot at the Iron Throne. And a more certain shot at gaining a “little” kingdom, so he (with his legitimate claim) would leave whoever actually sits on the Iron Throne alone.


But it’s not just the idea of R+L=J that makes people believe he will be king. Or that he “accidentally” gets called “king” repeatedly. 


For example by Mormont’s raven:


“King,” croaked the raven. The bird flapped across the air to land on Mormont’s shoulder. “King,” it said again, strutting back and forth.


“He likes that word,” Jon said, smiling.


“An easy word to say. An easy word to like.”


“King,” the bird said again.


“I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.”


“The realm has three kings already, and that’s two too many for my liking.” Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with his finger, but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow. 


and also by Robert:


“Kings are a rare sight in the north.” 


  Robert snorted. “More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!” 


No, one major piece of evidence for everyone who believes R+L=J is the Kingsguard hanging around the Tower of Joy after learning of Aerys, Rhaegar and Aegon’s death. They should have gone to Viserys. But if Jon is Rhaegar’s legitimate son, they would have stayed to protect him - as he would be the legitimate king of Westeros.


So if you are like Dany or any other Targaryen loyalist (or Stannis, actually) and reject the idea of the “right of conquest/might makes right” claim to the throne (because that is a free-for-all) he already is king.


(But then if you reject the right of conquest, Robb’s disappeared will and the fact that Bran and Rickon aren’t dead, (so basically everything) Sansa is also already Queen in the North.)


But it’s not that Sansa is kind of Queen if you squint reality away.  She gets repeatedly foreshadowed as queen and it is a lot less subtle considering that was the point of her engagement with Joffrey. Sansa even had plans to be the sort of queen that people would love. But even after that falls through, people don’t entirely stop thinking about her in those terms.


Like Tyrion:


Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he’d had the sense to love her. 


And perhaps Littlefinger:


“….What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three queens, I fear.”


Cersei, however, despite fearing a prophesied younger, more beautiful queen never seems to suspect Sansa of being the one in her POVs. Fandom, as it does with everything else, disagrees with Cersei’s assessment.


So here’s the one million dollar question: If all that foreshadowing and claims pan out and Sansa is gonna be (someone’s) queen and Jon’s gonna be king for real… isn’t the most likely scenario that it’s gonna be the same throne? 


Especially, if we are talking about the throne in the North? If Jon is Rhaegar’s son the chances of him becoming King of the North, replacing the Starks, are pretty dim. As long as one of Ned’s children is alive, Jon will not be widely seen as the better option… unless his children are also Ned Stark’s grandchildren, legitimizing him as a “Stark” through marriage. There is more than enough precedent for that. Like Mance’s favorite story of Bael the Bard. People seem to think that the story is a way to foreshadow the R+L=J reveal but what if it is foreshadowing for an actual future event?


It is also hardly the only potential foreshadowing for Jon/Sansa. People who believe in Jon/Dany put a lot of faith in Dany seeing a blue rose growing from a wall in the House of the Undying and hearing a howling wolf while being in the Dothraki Sea (her last chapter in ADWD.) 


In Jon’s last chapter in ADWD, he gets stabbed. Jon calls out for Ghost in the same way Robb calls out for Grey Wind before he dies. But we never learn if Ghost howls when Jon gets stabbed the way Grey Wind howled when Robb was hit by multiple arrows. It stands to reason though because not only Dany hears a howling wolf in the distance around that time but also Sansa. In her last chapter in AFFC (which shares ADWD’s timeline (and is most definitely after Jon became Lord Commander) and therefore could fit the timeframe of Jon’s assassination extremely well) she hears something that sounds like a howling “ghost wolf, big as mountains” while coming down the Eyrie.


That far away-carrying sound of a person in need reeks of magic, of fate, and of a high-brow literary reference: Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre. The interesting thing here is that not only does Sansa’s location support the reference to Brontë’s romance, the sound she hears is described pretty precisely as Ghost and it’s so loud and all-encompassing that she thinks it’s the wind. The howling wolf Dany hears, on the other hand, is far off in the distance.


But Jon does more than just getting stabbed in his last ADWD chapter. His stream of consciousness about his siblings in the same chapter earlier also has him associating Sansa with Ygritte:


Of Sansa, brushing out Lady’s coat and singing to herself. You know nothing, Jon Snow.


Which is spectacular (even if you disregard it as romantic foreshadowing), since the two rarely think about each other at all. Sansa’s POV shows her only consciously thinking of Jon when she prays at the Battle of Blackwater and when she is told he was made Lord Commander (again in her last AFFC chapter, which is with some degree of likelihood is around the same time Jon thinks about her):


She had not thought of Jon in ages. He was only her half brother, but still … with Robb and Bran and Rickon dead, Jon Snow was the only brother that remained to her. I am a bastard too now, just like him. Oh, it would be so sweet, to see him once again. But of course that could never be. Alayne Stone had no brothers, baseborn or otherwise.


Jon’s conscious thoughts of Sansa are nearly equally rare. He says that Winterfell is hers to Stannis and remembers that she told him to always compliment a girl’s name. But there is no conscious reflection of her being Tyrion’s wife, for example, which seems like the thing that should be at least worth a thought. Or that she is wanted for the murder of the guy who had their father executed, succeeding where Robb and half of Westeros failed. But nothing.


If one believes in dramatic irony, it is that thoughtlessness in regards to each other (and possibly Sansa’s anvilicious “that could never be” when thinking about seeing him again) that gives them the best chances of being the first (if not only) Starks to reunite.


Especially since they have never interacted on any of these nearly 6,000 pages. Which in combination with so little thought about each other, reeks of authorial intent rather than GRRM missing the opportunity to do so.


Because that way, any reunion between them will be fresh and new - the first time we see them interact and not merely passing each other by, like it briefly happens in AGOT. (Jon describes Sansa as “radiant” there, which is a weird nearly-Targaryen-like description for a sister.)


But even if Jon is that weird, he is still a step up from Sansa’s usual ""suitors"": a collection of old creepers, murderers and kin-slayers. Maybe one day someone like Willas Tyrell or Harry the Heir or the Great Other will turn up to be a good man to Sansa. But considering how important marriage has been to Sansa’s storyline, resolving it with a last minute white-knight-type character addition is so much of a narrative cop-out that it’s practically deus ex machina.


(I know some people like to imagine Sansa as the prize a male character gets after he stops being a creeper and becomes a “good guy” (although that’s rarely how they put it.) Personally, I find the idea of Sansa becoming a reward, even it is just a partial purpose of her character, creepy.)


Of course, other people find Jon/Sansa just as creepy because of their (pseudo-)incest. Ironically, it’s exactly this sort of repulsion which makes me believe in Jon/Sansa as a real possibility. 


See, without the incest, Jon/Sansa is a tired, tired trope about a damsel in distress and a dragon-riding/slaying hero. Two puzzle pieces that fit in the way they are similar and yet complimentary opposites. Boring.


But with the pseudo-incest it becomes the most outrageous and surprising plot twist. No one in the fandom, not even the people who ship it have any money on it happening. I don’t have have any money on it and I am writing a 6,000 words essay about it. 


It is ultimately one of the most surprising plot developments in terms of “love/marriage” that can possibly happen. ASOIAF lives from its plot twists. To discount this one solely because we won’t see a “positive” portrayal of pseudo-sibling incest is premature.


*


But the ultimate irony for the audience here though is not that Jon gets to be a “real” Targaryen with all that this entails or that of all “smart” political matches he can and should make, Sansa is the best one, but what I mentioned in the beginning - that the average reader wishes these two characters well and gets stabbed in the eyes for that.


We don’t want Jon and Sansa to die or suffer in the end. We want them to get what they want, we want them to be happy. But we also expect better from GRRM than a happy ending. Our perception of the world of ASOIAF is that it’s a crapsack world where happiness cannot exist without being tainted, that wishes and wants only come true at a high price.


And Jon wanted to be important, he wanted to be Stark, he wanted a loving family, he wanted Winterfell, he wanted legitimacy, he wanted to be a hero, he wanted to be Ned. 


Sansa wanted to be queen, to be important, to be loved for herself, wanted revenge, wanted to survive, to have her family (or what’s left of it (which to her knowledge the last time we’ve seen her is just Jon)) back, wanted to marry a good man, a kind man, a hero, a prince. 


And the readers, the majority of them, who don’t actively hate either of them, would like their wishes to come true after all what they went through. 


Jon/Sansa, especially as king and queen will give everyone everything they wish or wished for. Every single thing. And half of that Jon and Sansa won’t want anymore (because they are so gonna be over fairy tales, heroism, and thrones by the end of the series) and the other half they won’t want because the idea of pairing up won’t come to them naturally either.


I know it’s super-speculative of me to say that they will marry without being in love with each other. But I don’t think that Jon/Sansa makes sense in a scenario in which they end up together because they fell in love first - which is the other way Jon/Sansa could happen.


I don’t see that happening because 1 - it’s anti-climactic as far as story-telling is concerned, 2 - it’s too happy, 3 - nothing good ever happens to people in ASOIAF who fall in love with each other without good reason, 4 - that Jon/Sansa is an ideal political match should matter and if they are majorly into each other it won’t matter very much at all.


*


So here we have two characters we wish well and in a way they both get everything they wanted in life at some point in their lives. They get what we wanted them to get. 


And maybe some day that the timeline of the books certainly won’t cover, they might be able to arrange themselves with that. After all, they are similar people with similar dreams and their marriage will be the closest simulacrum to the childhood they both have began to idealize and idolize. 


And Jon might just have inherited the Targaryen gene to find a sister attractive in that way and Sansa, having been portrayed as super-distant from Jon and at least sibling-like in everyone’s recollection and the audience’s perception of their relationship might get over the ex-sibling thing. One day, they might circle all the way to the beginning and become the family they’ve lost and be happy.


And maybe there will be some twisted poetry and romanticism in Jon/Sansa as Ned and Catelyn 2.0. The two had after all one of the healthiest, happiest, and because of that perhaps even most romantic relationships in ASIOAF (to be fair, the bar is low and the competition practically non-existent.) So even the romantics might get something they wished for and yet didn’t. But no one, not the characters, not the readers, would consider the far away possibility of happiness a happy ending. It might be everything they want or wanted in a way, it might make them happy one day, but if it is the rational decision that I presume it would be, it would be merely the least terrible of all choices. No one’s gonna be happy with that - not even people who would actually like the idea of Jon/Sansa.


GRRM, in his trolling glory, promised a bittersweet ending. Giving us something that we want but in a way we don’t, with happiness as something that might occur - but only after we won’t be able to read about it anymore, is most certainly bittersweet.


But then, unlike Jon/Sansa itself, that is my one certain prediction about the series - that no matter who lives and dies, who marries whom or who’s gonna be sad, and forever alone in the end - that all we get in the end is the hope for happiness, not happiness itself.",117,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/8vjuig/a_time_for_wolves/,2018-07-02 20:11:34

339,bnqzir,[Personal Opinion] The ending for Daenerys does make sense,"While I definitely wouldn’t argue that it could be portrayed in a better way and have a more interesting build up to it, the idea of Daenerys being the final antagonist and doing anything to get the throne isn’t a bad ending imo. 


Throughout the show it’s been shown that she believes the throne belongs to her and will do anything in her power to get it.  How often she says she’s the rightful ruler and talks about burning anyone who opposes her clearly shows that she’s not going to be content with any ending other than her as queen or dead. And she was never going to be queen at the end, her whole story was about her seeking the throne, it would be too straightforward of an ending.

There’s also obvious signs that she can be a very brutal ruler, such as what she did to the masters of yunkai(?) and burning the Tarlys despite her being counseled otherwise. She also threatened to burn a city to the ground if they didn’t allow her to take refuge there in season 2. Now she’s realizing the people here don’t love her as much as she thought and she’s just lost everything she’s cared about.

Maybe it is just me, but I’ve kind of seen this plot point coming for a while now. HOWEVER, I haven’t fully read all the leaks and if the one where she allows her army to rape civilians  etc then that definitely doesn’t make sense because it was established in s1 that she was disgusted by that. And yes I can definitely agree that the arc of her becoming the mad queen could’ve been done better and had a slow transition, but the plot point itself isn’t necessarily a bad thing from my point of view.

""He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but “my half brother” since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant.""


3-jon and sansa also mirror each other....they are the only starks who faced a huge disillusionment in their storyline

sansa  was  a naive girl dreamed of becoming a princess,kiss handsome knights and lived in summer castles and end up realising that those knights were either psychos,manipulative assholes etc

Get your head out of your asses, Dany sacrificed a lot, yes, but if she was doing it to fight ""Jon's war"" then she was basically fighting the rightful King's war, and the North, in turn, owes her nothing.

What Dany is about to do to King's Landing after episode 4 is exactly the kind of shit she would do to the Starks and the North if she isn't kept in check, but somehow...the Starks are wrong to not want to kneel to her.

375,bklhhe,"Dany shouldn't win the throne, it goes against the theme of the story","The theme of the show is that playing the game of thrones is horrible, it destroys the entire country and almost gets everyone killed by white walkers. Dany's whole character has been using any means necessary to get her birthright back, meanwhile causing massive instability in Essos and now in Westeros. Now that her goal is in reach, it doesn't square with the established theme to have the culmination be replacing a bad ruler with a good one. That's not breaking the wheel, it's just turning it.

For Game of Thrones to end in a satisfying way, the throne needs to be destroyed, whether by Dany herself or by Jon. One reason I am excited by the possibility of Jon killing Dany in the leaks is that it mirrors the theme--Dany's blind ambition cannot be rewarded. Now, she doesn't have to die, arguably the more satisfying ending would be her learning in the end that she has been wrong the whole time and choosing to destroy the throne herself to set things straight. I think I would prefer that more because it shows the culmination of her arc, but I would be ok with Jon killing her if she doesn't have a change of heart.

Either way, for the story to be satisfying in my mind, there is no way anyone can 'win' the game in the end.",19,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bklhhe/dany_shouldnt_win_the_throne_it_goes_against_the/,2019-05-04 18:07:26

"" *Pay attention. One face will change everything.* "" Lf's faked death theory is heavily predicated on faceless men.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[LF will make his move at the climax of the battle. Everyone in Winterfell is either dead\/dying\/fighting or fleeing. Nobody will suspect a thing. It's complete and utter CHAOS, in other words.... Littlefinger's home court. He faked his death and hid in plain sight, in the crypts of Winterfell, where he waited to steal the blue rose of Winterfell and the last person whom Petyr Baelish loves: Sansa Stark. Right beneath Bran\(don\) Stark's nose, a clear parallel to Bael the Bard. They then retreat to the Vale, one of the safest locations aside from islands due to its altitude and singular point of entry. Suddenly Lf has the key to the north \(Sansa Stark\), Robin Arynn, and the remaining knights of the Vale. Dany is going mad, Jon is reeling from the loss at Winterfell, Cersei prepares to fend off whoever reaches KL first. Suddenly LF becomes a TOP contender. ](https://preview.redd.it/km9kp8llbbu21.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad57ae3f2f8d7a3da195589e9f52934256a98597)

All this ""the story we were denied,"" bullshit with a bunch of characters or story lines from the books that didn't make it into the show or didn't meet your expectations. Who the fuck do you think you are?

Who cares if Jon didn't pet Ghost, ffs. Who cares if Lady Stone heart wasn't in the show (recent post). You realize the logistics and time constraints behind all of this? A small example, GRRM said the real iron throne in the books would be WAY too big, cumbersome, costly and time consuming to make into a reality. They film in the largest hall in Europe IIRC.. Ireland maybe, I forget.

Anyway, that room wouldn't do the book version of the iron throne justice. Now imagine writing in every little thing when it comes to the books.. you sound like fucking twats sitting behind your screens crying about impractical issues.

I've heard alot of shit about Euron lately too and I agree the Rhageal thing was a stretch.. however.. i heard an argument about the scorpions and someone commented, ""all those years and why did they never think of that before.""

*Necessity drives innovation* 

The scorpion/ballistas were never a thing because they were simply never needed. The first one in S7 was smaller than those on the ships in S8. Qyburn is lowkey probably the smartest and best unofficial maester in the show btw.. when westeros was first conquered maybe the technology wasn't as advanved as it was now. Regardless it's all speculative.

So they upscale the scorpion out of necessity.. then comes a whole new era of warfare during S8. Ships are more vulnerable now. Maybe add iron to the sides of the hull to protect against the scorpions ? Once again, necessity drives innovation. 

Oh btw, Euron is speculated to have a full suit of Valyrian steel armor in the books... talk about plot armor.

Euron is supposed to be a feared character but for me I don't care for the actor personally. He just comes off as a creepy, goofy, pirate in the show.

In free folk's defense there are instances of poor writing and I do feel that areas were rushed and I respect that.

But this shit about, ""what could've been,"" or, ""what we deserve,"" needs to stop. It sounds pathetic coming from this sub. 

You honestly sound like snobs and Mance Rayder would have your heads.

 Through blind quarterstaff training + vague ""no one"" talk, and a few weeks arming sword training with a B list swordmaster (who doesn't do a very convincing job of teaching), she becomes a ninja who can beat Brienne with a fucking spadroon and dagger? With IMO pretty ridiculous choreography. And she also gets into this nonsensical feud with Sansa, over a letter she was forced to write. I really don't get the appeal.

424,9cecvq,Jaime Lannister will be the Hand of the King for King Aegon Targaryen and both TV Show and Books foreshadowed this ending game.,"Rewatching the show a few times it got my attention that in season 1 they made several little comments foreshadowing Jaime's ending game as Hand of the King.


* **S1E1** in his first scene with Cersei she tells him that he should be the Hand and Jaime remarks that its a honor that he could live without and makes a joke telling her that its a job that requires long days. Remember Jaime always uses jokes to deflect insecurance or frustration. I actually think he likes the idea.


* **S1E1** When they are preparing for the feast in the evening Jaime goes after Tyrion who is in a brothel with some whores. Jaime shows up and tells him to get ready for the party. ""The Starks are feasting on this evening, please dont leave me alone with those people""

That already got my attention. I expect the Jon and the Starks to rule the kingdom in the end and a new time, a time for wolves to start in Westeros by the end of this story, and I think Jaime will be the last Lannister left to restore his House.

* **S1E2** Later we see Jaime going to Jon Snow to thank him for joining the NW, he offers his right hand and makes a joke about Jon's decision. They even make sure to focus on the hand shake.

* **S1E3** When Ned Stark arrives in Kings Landing Jaime is in the Throne room to receive him. He makes a joke about Ned being the hand of the King ""how do they say it? the King shits and the Hand cleans it?

Again, he is making another joke and mocking Ned Stark, but I think he is a bit jealous, he wanted the job, but people dont think he is serious enough for such position. Nobody taks him seriously, no even his family.


* **S1E5** - in the Robert and Cersei scene where they discuss their marriage, once again there is the idea of Jaime being the hand of the King. Robert says that he will make Jaime his hand, but Cersei knows tells him that Jaime is not serious enough for the job.

* **S1E5** Robert goes see Ned and orders him to put back the badge of hand of the King or he will put the badge on JAIME LANNISTER and make him the Hand of the King!!!

How many times now did they mention Jaime and the Hand of the King job? how did I miss this in my first views of the show? I was actually shocked. I think the show was giving us some hints about the end right in season 1.

* **S1E7** - Tywin is introduced in that awesome scene with the dead stag and in that scene he asks Jaime to become the man he was supposed to be. Jaime now in season 7 is finally taking back his life and becoming the hero we all expect him to be.

**BOOK FORESHADOW**

And I would like to add that in the books it is not a pin, but a chain of hands that signifies the office of the hand.And the mummers make a rope and hang Jaime’s hand around his neck like a chain.

>Bolton’s silence was a hundred times more threatening than Vargo Hoat’s slobbering malevolence. Pale as morning mist, his eyes concealed more than they told. Jaime misliked those eyes. They reminded him of the day at King’s Landing when Ned Stark had found him seated on the Iron Throne. The Lord of the Dreadfort finally pursed his lips and said, **“You have lost a hand.”**             
     
>**""No**,“ said Jaime, **“I have it here, hanging round my neck.”** 

(ASOS, Jaime IV)

>Ned, **he should have kissed the hand that slew Aerys**, but he preferred to scorn the arse he found sitting on Robert’s throne –– 

ACOK - Catelyn VII


________________________

* **On season 5** -  Jaime decides to go to Dorne to rescue Myrcella, when Bronn asks him why go alone and not bring an army with him, he answer is **""I didnt want to start another war.""** He is able to convince Doran to let Myrcella go back to Kings Landing without start another conflict. (Of Course Ellaria Sand puts a ugly end to this agreement)

________________________

* **On season 6** - Jaime is sent to Riverlands to take back the Tullys castle from the Balckfish and once again he is able to solve the conflict without bloodshed.

Jaime Lannister, unlike his younger brother, is humble man, he pays attention to his mistakes and tries to learn from it and not repeat them.  He will be an ambassador, a peacemaker, the new Hand of the King. Jon Snow has no experience in the south; he doesnt know the Houses or the High Lords, but Jaime Lannister lived his whole life in Kings Landing, he watched his father his whole life. He would Jon Snow right hand during his rulling period.

425,950ead,Daenerys seemed intimidated by Cersei,"Beyond the awesome dragon entrance, the way she went to sit down during the meet and then nervously glanced over at Cersei who was glaring at her sealed it for me. And then saying ""Your capital will be safe, you have my word..."", when she should have said ""My capital will not be taken back until the northern threat is dealt with, that I assure you."" If I had directed the episode I would have instructed Emilia Clarke to be colder and even more amused by Cersei's exasperation, as if Dany is looking at her as a usurping upstart and is taking pleasure in her superiority. I wanted to see Cersei in more of a daze after experiencing the dragon firsthand and realising that she has to be more cautious than openly hostile, and has no choice but to cooperate if she wants to buy more time for herself. They acted like Cersei had the advantage! Was anyone else disappointed? It just feels like the show is now less about nuanced characters and is broadly painting Cersei as villainess and Jon & Dany as heroes when in previous seasons, there was an unpredictable quality to how these parts played out. Season 7 felt like watching cartoon characters instead of actual people. ",27,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/950ead/daenerys_seemed_intimidated_by_cersei/,2018-08-06 15:12:32

433,ch6bm4,"As I promised, I've written an elaborate post defending season 8 and it's character conclusions. Those of you who are going to call me ""kNEeLeR"" can fuck right off instantly.","Now, there are people who didn't like the season, trust me I don't have any problem with them. I'm here to analyse the characters and maybe have a discussion with the sensible ones but I'm also here to put some sense in the brain dead folks that lurk here and shit toxicity everyday. So any curse words that I use, It's not directed towards the people who are civil and polite. It's directed towards those Childish, band-wagoning hipsters who think it's cool to disrespect the actors and the writers. Those who were dumb enough to not observe the characters and understand the complexity of the said characters. Those dumbfucks who are just pissed that their fan theories didn't come true and the series didn't end the way they wanted it to. Guess what? Your fan theories were absolutely irrelevant and insignificant,and way way worse than the perfect ending that we actually got.  Deal with it. ""aWW i'M sO sAd i Didn't gET mY iNCesT BabY DIsnEY eNDing"". And before you accuse me of being a blind fan, I myself feel the season should have been longer and a bit more fleshed out but I absolutely don't think that any character was rUinED or bUTcherED just because my wishes didn't come true.

Now coming to the monstrosity known as ""daenerys stormborn"". Dany had always been mad,she just lost control of her madness in the final season. It was coming, many people saw it coming, only blind ""followers"" who saw her as some kind of god were in absolute denial. She was always cruel, ruthless and never ever hesitated to burn people alive. Let's begin with the little things and then we'll go to the more serious evidences. Threatened the spice trader of qarth,that she would burn down his city if he doesn't let her in. She never hesitated to kill even the innocents. The masters of mereen who had nothing to do with the crucifixion of the slaves,a noble man who she thought was involved with the sons of harpy. She showed no remorse despite Barristan, jorah and tyrion continuously telling her that not all of them were guilty and she should show a little amount of empathy even if they were guilty. But no, she getting off to people burning alive. Then when she comes to westeros,she becomes more power hungry. Burns dickon and randyl like a true tyrant, despite warnings from tyrion. What's the point of the hand if she is going to act on impulse? Then she realised she doesn't have enough love here,Jon's heritage, his sister clearly hates her,rhaegals death, missandei's death. All these things made her go completely insane. Don't forget, the mad king too wasn't mad when he was young. A particular incident made him snap and ultimately turned him more and more paranoid. Same thing with dany. She was always cruel and logic was her worst enemy but the incidents that happened in the last couple of seasons made her more emotionally unstable. When you are mad, you don't think straight, that's why you are being called mad in the first place. She burnt down the city to the ground killing lannister soldiers and civilians alike. Nothing mattered to her anymore but the throne. Just rewatch the series again and you'll know she was never a good ruler, not even a very nice human to begin with.

There are some idiots who think ""I never really cared for the innocents to be honest"" destroyed his character arc. Lmao what? Really, you couldn't see through it?

If you haven't noticed already,Jaime used to let his guard down and seek validation from honorable people like Ned and Brienne. He never told anyone the complete story and reasons behind his killing of Aerys. (Tyrion, but I'll come to that later) and when he was in the bath, Jaime was totally broken and in delirium. He just lost that one important thing that made him who he is. It's like his world came crashing down and on top of that there's a noble and honorable knight in front of him who hates him. He actually can't stand that. Brienne is what Jaime wished he could be. An honorable knight who tries her best to keep her promises, who does the right thing and is respected by the people. So in that moment, he let his emotions get the better of him and he just blurted out the truth. He just didn't find it important enough to tell tyrion why he killed Aerys (in the second last episode when he was held captive.) He never shared his true feelings with anyone other than Brienne. It was noticeable that he was lying through his teeth in his scene with Tyrion. All he was thinking of was cersei. How he could make it alive with her. Surely he wouldn't think of innocents when his mind was already preoccupied with worries about cersei. It was pretty apparent that he just said it for the sake of it. It was meant to be a joke ( a jaime-esque joke) and it seriously didn't mean anything. Of course he cared about innocents but not as much as he cared about cersei. That dialogue is nothing. I mean, yeah, it wasn't necessary but it didn't tarnish anything. How could you not fucking see through it? One mundane dialogue can't just change his 8 year long character development.

Also,Jaime and Cersei dying together was perfect. Jaime always loved her no matter what. He went to winterfell to honor his promise, to fight the wights but returned to cersei because he loves her. He himself said in winterfell, that whatever he did, he did for his family and his house and he'll do it all again if he had to. He didn't leave cersei for good, but to keep his promise. You can be a good and honorable person but you can't just change your this strong feeling of love that you harbour for another person .She is like an addiction. Like Olenna said ""if she has driven you this far,then its out of your control"". Jaime dying with cersei was a perfect ending. he died with his family. He loved his brother,father, but most of all his sister. How does loving a bad person cancel out his character development? How could he have stayed away from his one true love despite being honorable? And don't forget he was trying to fullfill a promise in his last moments as well. He promised Tyrion that him and Cersei will leave Westeros for good. No war or killings,just Jaime and Cersei living across the narrow sea,leading a new life. Had he killed Cersei,he would have broken another half a dozen sacred fucking oaths(kin killing/queen killing etc etc.) He did loved her,protected her and died for and with her. You people moan about character assassinations,and you would have been cool if Jaime had murdered Cersei? Really? How fucking Low your IQ has to be to not understand this simple logic? Killing Cersei would have indeed ruined his whole arc,because after being a part of so many honorable acts,if he just killed his lover and queen,then what's the fucking point?

If you actually wanted Jaime to kill cersei, even when she wasn't a threat anymore and was vulnerable to the core, then you are illogical because his whole arc was based on his redemption and love for cersei. Had he killed cersei then he would broken a dozen more vows, that would have indeed broken his arc .

Coming to Jon Snow and his perfect conclusion.

You people do realize not every person who has a strong heritage always leads a grand and luxurious life? And he just came to know about his heritage ffs. Jon was always true to the nights watch and the north. All his life he defended the wall,fought for his brothers,fought against his brothers,United the wildlings and the people South of the wall,killed wights and wight walkers,took a knife in the heart and fucking died. You think his heritage means shit to him? He knows deep down that he is a stark. Him being a targaryen never meant anything to him. He never fucking wanted the throne. It's dany's fault that she saw him as a threat. And let's be clear,he just came to know about his heritage a few episodes back. You think it's going to just change his mind and make him fight for the throne? All his life he was a humble man wanting to be loved. Not wanting to be in the damn spotlight. He didn't even want to be the lord commander at first, ffs. He never had this king like feeling to him. His main goal was to protect his people and his loved ones and save humanity from the walkers. You really think his heritage would suddenly make him fight for the throne? You're worse than the writers if you think that way. Him joining the nights watch and reuniting with the wildlings makes total sense after all he has done for them. He fucking saved them at hardhome ffs if that helps you remember. He is a legend among them. The wildlings worship him. It makes complete sense that he is the king beyond the wall. King in the wildlings' eyes. But sure,a person who gave his life for the nights watch and the wildlings would suddenly want to sit on the iron throne because of his lineage,which he just came to know about,right? Is this what you wanted to happen?

Jon being a targaryen was the least of his concern. He never gave a shit about ruling or sitting on that throne. It's just for us viewers to know that Jon wasn't a bastard. It added another dimension. It made us realize that Ned Stark was always an honorable man and didn't bed some random person during war ( Don't deny the fact that you thought Ned bedding someone else wasn't at all honorable and tainted his character.) It also made us realize that a man who has always been ridiculed for being bastard,a man who never got any love for being a bastard, wasn't a bastard after all. He was a damn stark targaryen and unlike his crazy ancestors and all the greedy power hungry bastards, he is the true hero for not lusting over a throne. It showed a contrast between those who fight for something that’s not theirs and someone who actually is the rightful heir, but doesn’t care about it because he knows the thrown wouldn’t make him happy. He’ll be happy whenhe is around his loved ones. That would satify him more than any superficial chair. It made us respect him more. Do you think him being a Targeryan really matters to him after all the shit he has gone through?

Azor ahai and the valonquar were hardly mentioned in the show. It never was an important factor. Expect it in the books. Arya's Prophecy came true though Arya killed the night king, freys and little finger. I guess little finger had green eyes? Even if he didn't, Arya has killed 100s of men, at least one of them might have had green eyes? It doesn't always have to be some queen or king or a main character.

While I did feel at first that Jon should have been the one to kill the night king, because it would have had a fitting end to his night watch arc,I don't think Arya killing the night kind doesn't make sense. Arya grew up to be an ice cold killer. Her Stealth and swift moves were perfect against the night king. She was obsessed with revenge and death. Night king was literally death. An embodiment. He was her last major kill and all her practice in bravos came to good use. The best silent killer kills the greatest threat to mankind.

Also, some people always seem to ask why didn't Tyrion name Jon as the king in the final episode? Why would tyrion name Jon as the king? He was a prisoner by that time. It was too late. They literally said that if Jon walks free then the unsullied will riot and if Jon is handed to the unsullied the north will riot. Were you people sleeping while watching the show? I wouldn't be surprised if you were. Bran becoming the king makes sense. Only living son of eddard stark who died defending the throne (this was more of a poetic ending on d&d's part,rather than ""logical""). But think about all plots and conspiracies that he can see going behind his back. Now you would say, it would have made sense for bran to become master of whisperers, but a master of whisperers doesn’t have much power. Kings can be pathetic and won’t ever consider what the hand or his council has to say.(dany,joffrey) With this he can make decisions on his own terms without having to worry about whether someone would believe him or not. He literally knows and sees everything . A king and his realm faces many difficulties and challenges. But under his rule those challenges are nothing. How advantageous is that? His coronation made sense,both poetically and logically. Nobody other than him actually deserved to be king.

Many people claim that Bran doesn't do anything. Are you kidding me? Have you ever wondered that the past and the future can't be changed in anyways ? All of it is already written and we are just pawns that need to be in the ""right place"" at the ""right time"". Bran probably knew Night King would die near the godswood tree. He and all other just had to be there in their respective places for the ""events"" to play out the way they are supposed to happen according to the future. And don't say Bran can't see the future. Even Jojen could see the future. Our future is already written and we are supposed to be at our places for the events to play out correctly.

Also sSomebody asked ""why did varys talk to Jon in the open when he knew he was being watched"" Wtf? This is just nitpicking. They were allies, why wouldn't they talk? Many dothrakis don't know the common tongue anyway, so they wouldn't even know what they are talking about. Dany didn't even know who betrayed her until tyrion snitched on varys.

Varys served the realm and had good intentions for the innocents. When he knew some mad bitch was going to destroy an entire city, How could he have stayed mum. It all fell on him. And IIRC he didn't even have any bird who could help him. (well, only one) He was fucked and trapped in an island and did his best to save the realm.

I have explained enough. Don't bother commenting nonsensical ramblings (oH LoOk KneELer, Oh lOOk dAVe) because I won't waste my time on stupid fucks. Oh and just for a reminder,even Nikolaj,Kit and Grrm himself are sick of your rotten behaviour on the internet. Just grow a brain ffs. I wish you Idiots had been a little more attentive while watching the earlier seasons and not dwelled on those stupid fan theories.

**“everyone had a better story than bran.”**
 
&nbsp;


Everything was spelled out in Tyrion’s speech at the dragonpit;

&nbsp;


**“These last few weeks I have been thinking about our bloody history. What unites people?  Armies? Gold? Flags? It’s Stories.”**
 
Their stories give them common goals,identity and creates societal cohesion. How they act is guided by the stories they tell about their history, and also informs them about themselves. The North’s identity is centred around being hard men living in harsh conditions who are strongly independent. According to their history, they saved the entire world in the first long night. The last hero ventured out into the far North to find help from the COTF because they were on the verge of extinction.  There was no outside help, they spent a winter that “lasted generations” relying only on each other.  Their words are warnings of the seasonal change. “winter is coming”,  where they have to prepare their holdfasts for the coming months.  “The North remembers” is a reminder that they rely on each other during those long winters. The lone wolf dies but the pack survives is not a Stark story, it is a story of survival in the North which the Starks hold to keep them cohesive.  
 
&nbsp;


The story of the iron throne also creates cohesion, but in a terrible way, through fear. It tells the story of war and acts as a reminder that if you step out of line, you will be melted into a chair where the king will plant his arse on you. Because of fear, people had to become underhanded to have any kind of power.  There aren’t any open discussions because you could simply be killed. 
 
&nbsp;


**“The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he would never walk again, so he learned to fly”**
 
Bran being king changes the narrative of ruling the kingdoms. From a broken kingdom (fall from a high tower) that will adapt and become better (fly).  His story is about progress and sharing knowledge.  He has access to the best solutions from all their history to solve problems.  He created his chair from “best fit” solution from every other chair from their history.
 
&nbsp;


**“He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories.”** 
 
Who has the better story? Alexander the great?  Mohandas Gandhi? Julius Caesar?  Jesus? Or perhaps it is all of our history books. Bran represents our history books (Westeros has a limited amount of books where most are hoarded by the Maesters) and he holds ALL the stories of every character throughout time. What is the bigger number? 5 individual stories or 1 united big story of them all? Bran also acts like meta on GRRM’s story.  The books are POV narration, and never give a complete picture.  Bran acts as an omniscient narrator that links all the character stories into one story and often fills in gaps in knowledge.
 
&nbsp;


I have mentioned before how GRRM has included, then proceeded to twist, almost every common fantasy trope, but there was one he didn’t twist.  It is the trope of a world that never changes or progresses. He included this trope, their world has not changed much for thousands of years.  In our storytelling we either do it from psychology or from a sociological framework.  People are the product of their psychology or from external societal influences.  Many fictional stories are told from psychology. We have character arcs which show a linear motion.  The characters change over time, whether from good to bad, or have a problem which is resolved. Real people don’t have this type of progression, all people perform acts that are considered good and bad. If our folk psychological ideas are so good at predicting behaviours, then why are we always left so baffled by what others do?  GRRM’s characters lack this linear type of storytelling.  They are grey and remain that way. He is telling a story of societal change, not caused by individual characters, but from changing the stories they tell.  This will over time influence their future behaviours as they form their identity around these new narratives. There is no longer heroes coming to save their world, only stories of people who have made mistakes. The world of Westeros is going to change dramatically since they are now opening knowledge to everyone through Bran. The masters are hoarders of  knowledge and dogmatic in their views. They locked away any information they deemed unnecessary.  Sam even had to steal books to try and find a bit of knowledge.  Now they have it all.

**”Why tyrion is on small council despite the fact that he is a turncloak and was the right hand of a tyrant?”**
 
&nbsp;


This question seems pretty straightforward to me.  Bran made him his hand.  Bran is the King. They had all only reached an agreement that he would be King, so thus they have to follow the rules, that a king’s decision is final. Everyone knew he had no committed some heinous treasonous act, he set his brother free. Nothing that needs pitchforks out and blood. They all wanted peace and to return to their respective kingdoms to restore order from all the chaos.  
 
&nbsp;


Even Grey Worm was not all that interested in Tyrion, he wanted jon.  He hung onto jon so tightly he brought Tyrion out for jon’s trial instead. GW got what he wanted, jon was going to be imprisoned for the rest of his life at the wall.  For GW this is slavery, which is far worse than death. And he had agreed to them electing a king and he decides what happens, since it was not up to him.

If this question was about the small folk, then they weren’t even there and don’t get to decide anyway (yet). They are too busy with injuries, destroyed homes, starvation and grief to worry about what the Lords are all doing.",57,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/dk1el8/fourth_response_question_about_tyrion_and/,2019-10-19 13:23:06
436,cnpded,Why the North (and Sansa) are entirely justified in not wanting to be ruled by Daenerys,"I've noticed a lot of people, especially on this subreddit, hating on Sansa and the North because HOW DARE THEY refuse to bend the knee to Daenerys Targaryen and show any resistance to being ruled by her. Never mind the fact that this subreddit is named after the Free Folk, who famously do not kneel. And I think it's about time someone called it out - maybe I'm not the first one to do so or at least attempt to do so, but the hate some of y'all have here is stupid.

I think a lot of you forget (or don't care) that the North has been threatened with violent subjugation by the South multiple times over. The very first case, of course, being that of Aegon Targaryen and Torrhen Stark, with the latter quickly bending the knee before the former so as to avoid the loss of lives to Aegon's dragonfire. I don't think it's exactly moral to threaten an (at the time) independent kingdom with mass destruction and loss of life (likely including civilians), yet that is precisely what the first Targaryen ruler of Westeros did. Few can, of course, blame Torrhen for attempting to save his people by swallowing his pride, but no one would or should consider this forced integration of the North a noble thing.

Fast forward to the ''abduction'' of Lyanna Stark by Rheagar Targaryen, which led to not only Lyanna's own death but also the murders of Brandon and Rickard Stark at the hands of Aerys Targaryen. Aerys then demanded Ned Stark's head, even though he had nothing to do with all this - and the North subsequently went to war with the South, in which I'm sure plenty of Northerners died or were killed and many more left without family. Even when the war ended with the Mad King's death and the crowning of Robert Baratheon, none can deny that the North was screwed over hard by Aerys's cruelty and that much of the South followed him into battle. The Lannisters, themselves Southerners, didn't help matters with their opportunism of only backing the winning side and then their own cruelty against others.

Then we get to the show timeline, where the Lannisters usurp the Iron Throne and frame Ned Stark for a crime he did not commit, while Joffrey has him executed. Then there's the fact they threw Bran out of a tower. And of course they eventually get Robb and his army killed through collusion with the Freys and Boltons, force Arya to go on the run for years, and treat Sansa rather horribly (even the non-Lannister Southerners never treat her well, refer to the time when Joffrey ordered her stripped of her clothing and no one bothered to help her other than Tyrion and Sandor). Remember that even the non-Lannister Southerners tried to rape and kill Sansa as well as cheered for Ned Stark's execution.

I think a lot of people forget that Southerners essentially killed not one, not two, but THREE Northern leaders and WAY more Northerners in all these conflicts. Not only Robb and Catelyn but also Robb's army, which consisted of Northerners from MULTIPLE houses, were brutally and dishonorably murdered in the Red Wedding. Even the crimes committed by treacherous non-Southerners, like Walder Frey and Roose Bolton, had a Lannister or Southern king's tacit approval.

Tyrion OUTRIGHT states that Frey would never have done what he did if not for Tywin's guarantees. Jaime himself points out that everything the Freys did was only possible because of the Lannisters' support. Roose even outright says ''the Lannisters send their regards''. The whole Sansa being married to Ramsay subplot, in addition to being bad writing and rape played for drama, would never have occurred if not for the small matter of the Boltons only being Wardens of the North to begin with BECAUSE of a corrupt Lannister regime putting them there. It's completely understandable why the North would rather be ruled by one of their own as opposed to another corrupt Southern fucker.

In real life, fighting for independence is (rightfully) not considered a bad thing at least after the fact. The US only exists because of a rebellion movement against the UK. The US's war against the UK was initially motivated by (correct me if I'm wrong) unjustified taxation, which on its own massively pales in comparison to the abuses visited by the South upon the North. Multiple countries, including India, fought for some measure of independence from their colonizers - would anyone call India ''evil'' for not wanting to be under British rule? Bangladesh fought for independence from Pakistan, would you consider the Bengalis ''evil'' for not wanting to be represented by a corrupt and genocidal government?

Now, people would come in and say ''but Daenerys isn't Cersei or Aerys''. It. Doesn't. Fucking. Matter. Just like it didn't matter to the US founders that the next British rulers could well be far more reasonable than the one they had been fighting. King George III may well have been an asshat, but for all the founders knew, the person after him or the one after that could have been a much better ruler and not imposed such taxation. If we can accept that the US is right to want independence and maintain it, why doesn't the North get a similar deal? They had it EVEN WORSE.

Now people might bring up ''but Daenerys helped the North''. So fucking what? That doesn't make the North beholden to her. I could point out that Daenerys didn't even take the Night King seriously until Jon risked his life to bring her evidence, and that it was HER dragon that took down the Wall and accelerated things. She could've given him and his crew some extra men as protection for the wight hunt, even Lyanna Mormont did that with her 62 men in spite of having an even better argument for not supporting his claim to the Iron Throne. Jon nearly died against the White Walkers in S7.

Also, even if Daenerys helped the North, it by no means rectifies the South-North imbalance of justice. Even Aerys wasn't a total dick to the North until later in his reign, and the same is true with the Lannisters. Another issue is that people are assuming that the North can't, you know, pursue positive and even friendly relations with the South without being under its rule. Yet another idea would be for them to have independence IN THEORY but not necessarily practice, as Renly offered to Robb. In real life, the US and UK were strong friends and allies after independence (though not immediately after) and traded with each other for years. India and the UK are at least no longer enemies or hostile to each other.

Finally, GOT has tried to make it clear that a good ruler must have the consent of the ruled. Jon is the example of this. He never wanted to be King in the North but became it as his people wanted him to be. Same with the Lord Commander position. In the books, even Stannis of all people gets this when he realizes that he must save the kingdom to win the throne, not the other way around. Jon would not have got to where he was if he didn't accept the Wildlings and their sense of autonomy, which is EVEN greater than that of the ''proper'' North. Come Season 8, and the Wildlings accept him as their leader anyway lol. 

Daenerys, for all her good intentions, had an entitled attitude and a surprising lack of empathy for the North that showed itself even in her first talk with Jon. And as we all saw, bad writing or otherwise, she went evil anyway and destroyed King's Landing after WINNING the war, something even Aerys didn't do. Aerys at least lost before he tried that. Sansa (and Arya) seem to have realized the risk of this, and combined with the earlier history of oppression of the North by Southron rulers, knew better than to just kiss Daenerys's hands.",156,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/cnpded/why_the_north_and_sansa_are_entirely_justified_in/,2019-08-08 21:57:03

465,bmky9s,"If you think Dany's the hero, you haven't been paying attention.","I love Dany. She’s a complex and interesting character that is fun to root for. We’re supposed to root for her because we’re supposed to question ourselves when we realize we’ve been rooting for the villain all along.  We love her for both her mercy and her ruthlessness.


Viserys might be a massive dick who arranged a marriage for sister (like every other highborn family) but did that really justify his torturous death? We certainly cheered for it.


We cheered when Dany burnt Mirri maz Durr alive, ignoring the fact that her actions were to ensure that “the stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now. His khalasar shall trample no nations into dust.”  A cause that we would otherwise expect Dany to emphasize with.


We cheered when she called for the Unsullied to “Kill the Masters”, while totally ignoring the death and destruction she leaves in her wake in Yunkai, Astapor, and Meereen. Regardless of her intentions to fight injustice, the impact that she leaves these cities is death, starvation, and ruin. She might have conquered these cities, but she was no ruler.


We cheered when Dany crosses the narrow seas back to Westeros but justify her burning the Tarlys to death because they refused to bend the knee. She has come to conquer Westeros because it is her “destiny”.


Now, we jeer Sansa for, rightly, seeing through Dany’s savior facade. Daenerys came to conquer Westeros and the newly freed North with it. She has made it clear what she will do to those who refuse to bend the knee.


The transition from “I want to break the wheel” to “It is my right to drive the wheel” is supposed to be subtle. It is the classic “You were supposed to destroy them, not join them” tragedy of Anakin Skywalker. In our world, it calls back to those who willfully cheered on their leaders until they became murderous dictators. I believe GRRM wants us to question ourselves and how we could be so easily led by a beautiful woman who said all the right things we want to hear while we justified her actions as “right”.

470,9afg5a,I will never not find it funny when I see how much fictional (doesn’t exist in real life) Daenerys Targaryen makes some real human beings feel insecure and emasculated.,"I know that there are people out there who genuinely don’t like the character for understandable reasons. You’re not who this post is about. This class of people don’t feel the need to write metas or posts every other day and twice on Sundays on why “she’s the worst” nor do they go out of their way to demean her achievements. They just don’t like her, say it here and there (if at all) and they move on. The difference is that it’s not personal. It’s not insecurity. 

Growing up, my dad always said that in life, your reaction to or perception of something/someone matters more than the thing itself. Basically, how you interpret things says a lot about you than it does the object of interpretation.


I used to be very active on football twitter and let me tell you, the rivalry there has given birth to some of the funniest and ugliest moments I’ve seen on the internet so I understand rivalry. The worst being between Messi fans and Ronaldo fans. Long story short, one is perceived as very humble including when he almost ran his fans over because they wanted an autograph and the other doesn’t have a tattoo on his body because he’s a blood donor. Guess who’s more hated.


My point is, I’ve seen what insecurity from fans looks like and this is what making fun of that insecurity looks like;

and


https://twitter.com/Biancocelesti8/status/1033475666048630788



So you see, this is nothing new to me (I guess expecting too much from the GOT fanbase is my fault). 

There’s just something about people (fictional or real) who own that they’re the best that makes me respect and love them. They don’t just talk a big game, their actions are always more loudmouthed. Usually, they have very vocal haters, but they’re the ones that history remembers. In relation to this particular post, that legend’s name is Daenerys Stormborn of The House Targaryen.

There’s an ASOIAF youtuber who actually admitted that seeing a tiny woman in command made him feel uncomfortable in the beginning and I respect the honesty. It’s what we’ve come to know and it’s what many will still deny.


The fact that some people hate a ###fictional character with such an intensity is pathetic and in a sad way, hilarious. 



All this said, later this week, I will be posting on the following topics;

1.	**Why House Targaryen is by far the best house in Westeros**. 
2.	**Sandor and Lady Sansa (I might actually put this one up today)**.
3.	**The legend that is Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen and her nine titles**.

479,8zb7zx,the reality about jonerys,"I'm a big fan of the couple Jon and Daenerys, but I need to say something that bothers me and it's a sad reality. For me it's already proven that the actors have an exuberant chemistry, Jon and Dany have an incredible chemistry as well as Jamie and Claire from the Outlander shows. But what's the difference between these two couples that explode chemistry?

 is simple, the actors who play Jamie and Claire / production are deeply committed to making a work that transpires to the public love, seduction, passion, there is professionalism among the actors who are very close friends and are able to do any kind of scene . 

But for me, Kit and Emilia do not make a point of being deeply involved in the love of Jon and Dany, unfortunately what I think is that we will not have enveloping scenes, with lust and passion, simply because the actors do not want to do such scenes as well the production does not want to create strangeness between kit and Emilia soon at the end of game of thrones, there will be no engagement and professionalism in the deepening of Jon and Daenerys. I highly doubt that D & D writes a nude scene again that involves the two great actors in the series. 

Jon and Dany have the potential to be one of the best couples of all time, but this is far from happening, as the barriers are not being broken

480,8bwyo2,"Another ""shitty theory"" that has evidence which freefolk will implode if it is true.","GRRM:

>The Wars of the Roses have always fascinated me, and certainly did influence A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, but there's really no one-for-one character-for-character correspondence. I like to use history to flavor my fantasy, to add texture and versimillitude, but simply rewriting history with the names changed has no appeal for me. I prefer to reimagine it all, and take it in new and unexpected directions.

GRRM takes historical figures as ""samples"" and takes them in unexpected directions. He samples people from history, but he doesn't make them one to one. GRRM then talks about foreshadowing and implies that he draws Tyrion's character from Richard III:

>I like to surprise; but I also like to foreshadow. I use my historical sources in a mix and match way. **Obviously I have drawn on the Wars of the Roses, but Tywin Lannister is not Warwick the Kingmaker and Tyrion is not Richard of Gloucester.** I am also drawing on the Hundred Years War, and the Albigensian Crusade and stuff from outside Europe. It is always a mistake for my readers to assume any one for one correspondences. The joy of fantasy is that you can more easily take your plot off in different directions--in historical fiction, you know most of what is going to happen.

He gets aspects of Tywin from Warick the Kingmaker, but they Tywin isn't Warick, he gets aspects of Tyrion from King Richard, but Tyrion isn't Richard.

In my other post about Daenerys becoming killed by the Others, I showed that GRRM put several Shakespeare references. From Othello, Hamlet, and King Lear to  Titus Andronicus and Frey pies, there was another one which I mentioned was *Richard III* play by Shakespeare and its ASoIaF counterpart: *the Bloody Hand*.

Richard III:

>And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,

>To entertain these fair well-spoken days,

>I am determined to prove a villain

>And hate the idle pleasures of these days

The Bloody Hand:

>As I cannot be the hero

>let me be the monster

>and lesson them in fear in place of love.

King Richard III in the play was set to marry Elizabeth of York (Stark), while Tyrion is set to marry Sansa in the play. Which he did end up doing.

The show's version of Arya's *Mercy* chapter which includes *the Bloody Hand* has Arya sent by the Faceless Men to kill the actor who plays Cersei Lannister.  The person who ordered the hit was the actor who played Sansa Stark, who wanted to play the role of Cersei Lannister, the queen.

Sansa + Tyrion on the throne is endgame.  Interestingly enough, Peter Dinklage actually played as Richard III one time:

481,735tkz,POSSIBLE LEAKED SPOILERS FOR SEASON 8 - BE WARNED,"I know there's been rumours of a source leaking details about Season 8, but I have a source who has given me the REAL details on Season 8. 

Read at your peril. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
the season opens up with Jon and dany in bed on the boat. They talk about their relationship and it shows the White walkers going through the wall. 

Tyrion consoles Jorah, who gets depressed because Jon porked Dany. 

Bran finds out about Jon and Dany. He tells Sam, who he has confided in. Sam is shook af to hear this news and begs Bran not to tell Jon, thinking it will destroy him and ruin their chances at defeating the Night King. 

Theon kills Euron, but is killed himself. Yara takes control of the Iron fleet, which is then burned by Viserion. Yara dies.

Jon, Dany, Tyrion and co go to Winterfell. Jon reunites with the Stark family, Bran tells Jon he needs to speak with him later. 

That night, Sam pushes Bran's wheel chair down the stairs and kills him. Jon and co don't suspect Sam of anything. However, Jamie was watching and saw everything.

Jamie tries to tell Jon about Sam, but he imprisoned Jamie. 

Tyrion and Sansa reconnect and consummate their marriage. Sam begins getting dreams of a Three Eyed Raven. He sees Bran in his dreams. 

Jon officially bends the knee, in front of the other Northmen. The other Northmen are hesitent to accept Dany, but she gives them a speech and they all come to accept her. 

Jon and Dany agree to get married. Because Jon is a bastard, he intends to take the name Targeryn. However, on the Eve of their wedding, Jorah challenges Jon to a fight to the death. Jon wins, but doesn't kill Jorah who commits suicide.

Tormund and Beric show up, having survived from the Wall. They warn the others about the White Walkers advancing. 

They all go to move out to meet the White Walkers in an open field. However, before they leave, Sam has another dream.

He sees the identity of the Night King - Aegon I Targaryen. He travelled across the Wall, hoping to explore and was captured by the Children of the Forrest who turned him into a White Walker. It's why he knew the dragon was coming. 

Sam writes a note, telling the truth about Jon and the Night King and hangs himself. However, Varys reads the note and burns it. 

Jon, Dany, the dragons and most of the fighting force go to face the White Walkers, Sansa, Tyrion, Arya and Gendry stay at Winterfell.

Cersi marches on Winterfell with the Golden Company. She negotiates with Sansa for Jamie's release. They release Jamie.

Cersi then reveals to Jamie that she had the Golden Company place caches of Wildfire all around Winterfell and the North. On her command, she's going to ""Burn them all"". Jamie refuses to go along with this plan and strangles Cersei with his golden hand. 

He takes control of the Golden Company and the Mountain and transports all the Wild fire somewhere else. 

Viserion is killed by the other two dragons, but all 3 dragons die in the battle. 

Jon and co retreat back to Winterfell. Jamie activates the Wildfire caches  and creates a ring of Wildfire around Winterfell, giving them a breather. 

Varys tells Jon and Dany everything, thinking they're all about to die. Jon kills Varys. 

The Wildings break through into Winterfell, it's one final huge battle. Ed Sheeren's character shows up and saves Arya, they share a kiss (Arya's like, 18 by the end of the show and the actress who plays her is in her 20s. Calm down weirdos) before Sheeren's character gets ripped apart by White Walkers

The Mountain gets turned into a White Walker, but is killed by the Hound using a flaming sword. Both brothers are engulfed in fire and die 

Milisandre returns during the chaos and goes to a mysterious gravesite in King's Landing. She says the Lord of Light's prayer and dies. 

All hope seems lost. Jon and Dany are about to die, Arya is badly wounded, Grey Worm dies. 

Suddenly, Ned Stark appears, having been ressurected by Miliandre in her last act. He wields Long Claw and kills the Night King, ending the threat once and for all.

It turns out, Ned was the prince who was promised all along.

Dany refuses to be queen. Instead, all 7 Kingdoms are once again split up. 

The Iron Throne is melted down and made into a statue of Ned 

Jon and Dany rule the Crownlands, Sansa and Tyrion rule the North, Gendry rules the Stormlands, Varys runs Dorne, Ser Davos rules the Iron Islands, a freed Edmure Stark rules the Riverlands, Grey Worm and Missandei rule the Vale.  

Ned and Arya venture across, passed the remains of the Wall to discovery the true origins of the White Walkers and make sure they never return.

The end.

Probably this is going to get downvoted so I am going to keep it simple and to the point.

- **STOP** asking what was the point of making us think that Jon and Dany are going to have a baby. When you started watching you thought Ned Stark is going to be the next king

- **STOP** telling that Dany becoming mad/evil in two episodes is stupid writing. She was portrayed as a breaker of chains and mother of dragons and all other titles to be portrayed as a saint. Such a person loosing it all is what this show will do if it lives up to its previous reputation (because it's worse than death). It's shitty writing now alright but it's the right thing to do

- **STOP** telling that the show will be shitty if Jon kills Dany. This is Game of Thrones and you can go back and to watching Sleeping Beauty if you want a and-they-lived-happily-ever-after ending

- **STOP** telling that Euron shot those arrows (or whatever you want to call it) 3/3 perfect on Rhaegal. He didn't have no obstacle infront of him and a crossbow that size was designed to kill of Dragons. Do not underestimate Qyburn

496,bj9h8j,"For the sake of my sanity, someone push dragonglass in my heart. I volunteer for next NK. Help, what bunk did I just witness in episode 3?","JO! First and foremost. I honestly never felt the urge to share my, in all honesty, insignificant opinion on the web. As with most opinions, it's often to no avail and unnecessarily time-consuming, or simply put.. not exactly meaningful. However, I do always applaud and admire those who put in the effort or making their opinions/voice be heard, Salut. End of the day, all those technically add-up to the overall opinion/public view of a product. And I truly appreciate all active users, regardless of stance on the matter. Now here is mine. 

&#x200B;

The reason/urge for me doing so, other than being tilted from this lackluster episode lol. Is that I clearly see a general movement towards the plea for more in-depth stories/screenplay writing. Not necessary with GoT, but in general. Which I personally feel is a tremendously good thing, and hopefully a sign of good things to come.  As GRRM described, I feel we're sick of the ""Your typically evil is evil, good is good blabla"" scenarios or the cliche ""All main characters have plot armor and good guys always win.."" kind of events. But more so crave a balanced experience, where we as readers/viewers slowly decide who has valid points/reason and sympathize with whomever we deem fit. This in combination with the realization or expectation that nobody is truly safe. Resulting in ""Nobody is a villain in their own story."" And no matter what side of the spectrum you're on in terms of liking GoT. We kinda universally want to break the wheel of cliche writing, right? 

&#x200B;

Well, before you pin me down and swarm me. I'm just a casual who enjoyed reading the books/lore and watching the show of course, although the show less as I felt it was going downhill. However, the reason for my salt is not because my future view/predictions or ""theories"" did not come to fruition. Far from that actually. In all honesty, I didn't really occupy myself with those. Of course, everyone has something in mind in terms of a preferable outcome. But it wouldn't bother me in the slightest if it completely derailed from that. In fact, the unpredictable factor is so appealing. No worries, I'm not here to convince everyone the show has some horseshit bad/lazy story writing. Or convert your opinion if you do like this Season. From numerous different point-of-views, everybody has some sort of legitimate standpoint. And that's perfectly fine. But seeing the sheer number of complains, disappointment, gutted and rather confused people among side me (Thank Fuck for that). I might as well clean my thoughts. 

&#x200B;

Back on track. I'm not going to address all my thoughts on the endless of aspects in the episode, or season. That would just turn into nitpicking or circle-jerking on rationalizing a fiction we don't have control over. And people would presumably just feel the urge to answer/prove my analytics, perspective wrong. Which would be fine, but its more so addressing some general points/obvious concerns I feel fans shouldn't tolerate. Or at least provide some food for thought on why the show of this masterpiece lost the magic. So let's start. I guess if you like turning the mind off and just enjoy watching some random action, the episode was likely fine. Thing is, we can practically find that anywhere.

\- Non-stop dark scenes. Nothing major, but rather a small nuisance. Sure, give it a more dramatic effect. But I bet everybody at some point tried adjusting their TV setting/brightness to get a better view of it all. Half of the time it was a bit too much, and you could definitely not take in much detail.

\- Plot armor. This doesn't need much explaining as it seems the main let down for most. Yes, it was painfully obvious. But before you think ""not this again.. we get it"". I sincerely don't crave blood and/or death for characters just because. I totally get the fact you need to preserve characters for the upcoming Cercei arc. However, it was a relentless cinematic of main characters getting swarmed or experiencing near-death moments just to be rescued in the last second. Most frustrating of all, they would cut scenes on the moment of presumably going down. Just to return them in perfectly fine condition a few shots later. During the whole fight, none of the main characters had a problem surviving the endless waves of wights. Which is fine, but at least put them in more favorable/safe positions to make it more credible. For example, Sam endured countless of wights stockpiling him. Meanwhile, the elite fodder warriors get deleted within moments. Again, even that would be tolerable but please spare me the exact same close to dying scenes over-and-over again. 

\- Some minor complains. Lack of effort in Jon, Bran, WW/NK. What exactly was Jon his contribution in it all? Yes, I don't know either. Being fodder I suppose. Apparently, they did not want the predicted hero to add much weight in this conclusive fight. Also fine, but some more decisive support/action from Jon would be slightly fitting. Bran, being the specific target and this powerful greenseer with so much knowledge did absolutely nothing. Perhaps we get some more insight next episode but apparently, it was more along the lines of ""I'm afk. Wake me up when this shit is over.."" just relaxing in his safe-space. Now obviously the NK did put in work, but not so much as first observed. Other than the casual controlling, raising dead and doing some dragon riding. We don't get a demonstration of his actual sword-wielding abilities or general combat. Although there was plenty of opportunities. Likewise, none of the actual WW got their hands dirty. It was practically wights only. While we're at it, Melisandre part was rather weak as well. Just here to light the trench and hype up Arya?  

\- ! The main issue, complete lack of reasoning. You have this enormous build-up towards the threat of the WW/NK from the start, with countless of lore/prophecies/mythical stories/cryptic symbols/actual events, etc. Making it out to be the most important and meaningful battle of the current time. Broadly spoken, the story is of course generally and inevitably all about the throne. And we know the WW/NK had to be stopped in order to continue that story. But a long night or losing the ""Great war"" would put all that into insignificance. ""There's only one war that matters, and it is here."" Putting a lot more emphasis on the importance of winning it. So they did, and the problem isn't necessarily about that. But rather the lack of background or purpose of it all. 

Throughout the show, they made the WW/NK very mission-driven. Even to the point of calculating smart. Think of the dragon trap, making a pact with Craster to convert baby's, specific movement, even some sort of signs of communication, at least within the book, creating symbols, making a blizzard to render the dragons, etc. thus making viewers curious about the state of their objective or at least wonder about a deeper meaning. Sure, some could argue the objective was clear. Just mindlessly kill and conquer. However, we all know that is exactly against all principles GRRM stands for. Furthermore, the NK doesn't seem to practically interested in only mindless killing. He had plenty of opportunities to make a proper effort of killing Jon/Dany before the war. He even went as far just observing Jon and showcasing/flexing his resurrection powers towards him at hardhome. Now alright, we get to know in a rather weird and fast manner that the NK specifically wants Bran aka Three-Eyed Raven. For the sole reason of being the hard-drive with history of men. But what is that knowledge worth if you're going to wipe out mankind in the first place? And Bran doesn't partially showcase any potential that could hurt/kill him? Or even provide an effective solution for everybody. The last Three-Eyed Raven was stuck in a cave, not exactly threating either. Regardless, the vibe I personally felt was pretty clear. The NK was keen on doing the job of killing Bran himself, like it was some sort of poetic justice or vengeance/retribution between those two. If mindless killing is the objective, why not wait a minute and remain out the line of fire and let the wights/ww finish the job. Who knows, maybe they will enlighten us more in the next episodes. But I'm afraid the lack of depth/meaning we are so eager to see is totally lost. 

\- Lack of twist. So Arya killing the NK is the twist, I suppose? I'm tired, but the directors literally have endless of mind-blowing scenarios they can play out here. I don't necessarily dislike the kill, but a pretty unimaginative end. Or let me rephrase, a heavy miss in terms of possibilities. Even still, this can be tolerated if we had some more damn meaning. I'm more confused now than before the season.

&#x200B;

/Rant over. If I didn't bore you to death and you actually read it. Respect and Thank You for listening/reading. End of the day, a loud fanbase does seem to be the backbone for future progression. Not talking about the show GoT now as that is all set in stone. But we clearly strafe for more exciting/constructive/in-depth stories and screenplay, glad to see. Peace!
