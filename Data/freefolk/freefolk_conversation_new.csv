TLJ basically said everything that happened in the Original Trilogy didn't matter. It said all the plot lines established in just the previous entry, didn't matter. The New Republic *kinda forgot* how to fight and just get conquered by the smaller First Order in a matter of hours. 

Like genuinely, TLJ makes it so that everything that happened in episodes 1 through 7 *doesn't matter*. At all. It makes no sense in any meaningful way. The plot is nonsensical and contrived, the characters are inconsistent to all hell. Just the simple choreography / structure is so bad that characters are genuinely *teleporting* all over the place for the movie to 'work' and 'move forward'. (E.g. how Phasma was about to execute Rose and Finn from like 3 feet away, explosion happens, Finn comes to and Phasma who was apparently teleported out walks in from clear the other side of the ship in pristine armor.)(or how Rose pulled back and accelerated away from Finn, Finn went full speed ahead, in the same vehicle, then Rose somehow teleports in front of Finn in order to crash into him after she realized he wasn't following)(or how weapons were CGI'd out half way through the fight scene with the Sith Guards so it would make sense to why Mary Sue doesn't get chopped in half).

Basically what RJ accomplished in The Last Jedi was to systematically shoot down every interesting plot thread from The Force Awakens and left nothing for fans to go off of between ep 8 and 9. You can tell they felt the need to fix RJ’s mistakes by bringing back Palpatine, obviously killing off Snoke left them with no viable main villain (Kylo Ren is conflicted, but not really main villain material).

You can tell in the hype levels going into ep 9, which is out this month, yet it feels like it’s a year away because of how little attention it’s getting. The run-up to both eps 7 and 8 were big, fans were theorizing left and right about every aspect of the movies, yet all that seems pretty muted now. Maybe it’s my own lack of enthusiasm showing, but it feels like nobody cares about it (I’ll likely still see it with my son, but I’m not looking forward to it)

One of the reasons I don’t take TLJ salt too seriously is that so many people seem to be grasping at any random complaint they can grab hold of, even if it doesn’t make any sense. It shows an underlying emotionality. It suggests you don’t actually know what you’re really upset about. Probably just the standard ones- you don’t find it satisfying that Rey’s parents were no one, that Snoke wasn’t important, that Luke was a bitter asshole. But it’s harder to attack those from a storytelling perspective so just grab at something random that’s pissing you off even if you don’t know why.

And I have seen some really good and solid criticism of TLJ. I mean I liked it quite a bit but it still had a ton of flaws, although as mentioned, a lot of it is actually just carryover problems from TFA.

But stuff like this is just emotionality, not real criticism.","Even half of the movie itself didn't matter.

They knew for years that they were the most popular show around because of their intricate story and character work and they never thought to shore up the staff with people who could sustain that past GRRMs published work. 

I respect that D&D signed up to adapt and not to write, but more than that they signed up be show runners, to RUN the show. What gets my goat is that had they just hired some writers, taken more time off things would have been so much better. Instead this was subpar because they gave up.

This is the same argument I hear from people defending GoT S8. That plot point COULD have been good, it COULD have been interesting, but it wasn't. The problem with it is Luke's motivation. Why does Luke believe the Jedi need to die? That's the entire reason why he thought about killing Kylo and why he went into exile, so what's the answer? There isn't one. At least not one set up in the movie. All we see in the film is Luke saying he saw Snoke luring Kylo in and then got scared. We don't see why Luke is afraid of Snoke, how the Jedi teachings failed him, or how Luke became a pessimistic coward. We don't follow that plot point because it makes no sense from the last time we saw Luke. This is the reason Mark Hamill has stated he couldn't view his character as Luke, and instead had to see him as Jake Skywalker.

It then establishes a bunch of mystery boxes- Who are Rey's Parents? Who is this Snoke? Why was Luke hiding?

And as far as I've been able to tell Abrams had no actual plans for resolving any of these dangling questions.

This created an impossible ask for any sequel; resolve these unresolved mysteries in a way that satisfies all fans in the midst of a story and setting that lacks any cohesion and that banks on nostalgia by basically invalidating the plot of the original trilogy.

Up to and now including apparently just bringing back the Emperor. 

Like the clearest example I think is with Luke. So many fans are pissed off that Luke is a bitter old hermit in this story, going to a backwoods planet to die.

That's not our Luke! Our Luke is a hero!

The problem is, besides this literally being what both of his mentors did, that literally any other explanation for why Luke hid himself on a remote planet and tried to avoid being found is going to be far worse.

Like Luke is a much, *much* bigger asshole if he thinks he'd be useful to the Resistance and then ran away anyway. The only good reason for him to be hiding is because he thinks he's not capable of helping, that he's a fuckup. 

Luke's disappearance in TFA is presented as a big mystery box into which fans can pour half-formed speculation, but it becomes obvious with a moment of thought that there was only one real possibility that had any narrative significance. 

And frankly I think the fans that don't see this stuff lack an understanding of story structure at a basic level.

I'm reminded of how when I used to hang around this sub back in season 5-6, hell, even in 7, and I would point out why the story was falling apart I would get downvoted and told to fuck off because people didn't want to hear it. They applauded D&D the entire time they were knocking out the support beams, and then acted shocked and outraged when the roof collapsed on their heads.","I have never been impressed with any attempt I've seen to draw parallels between GoT S8 and TLJ, and I'm not impressed with this one. 

The first and most obvious problem with your argument:

*Luke is not the fucking protagonist.*

Daenerys was the co-protagonist with Jon Snow of the entire fucking series. Literally she was the most central pillar of the entire story- a good 1/3 or more of the plot even early on was just dedicated to her rise to power, even when disconnected from everything else on an entirely separate continent. By the end, her military campaign *was* the story, especially after they unceremoniously ended Winter early. 

Understanding the logic and motivation and trajectory of Dany's descent into pure villainry is really fucking important.

Understanding Luke's isn't because in the new trilogy, *Luke isn't the fucking protagonist.* He's not even close to one. He, like Leia and Han, get relegated to background roles. He's not Dany, he's Jorah or Barristan. And like let's take the latter, who did get shabbily treated by D&D- but Barristan being offed was very clearly not even in the same scale of fuckup as what they did to Dany.

While the series in general needs a lot more establishment of setting and background and what happened in between the OT and the Sequels, and that lack is a detriment to the story, we don't need a point-by-point account of Luke's attempts to train the new generation of Jedi, a full account of his failure, and to witness him struggle and fail to come to terms with it. In fact, it would be straight up bad storytelling to spend that much time on Luke. I do love Mark Hamil but I feel like he may legitimately have lost track of the fact that Luke stopped being the protagonist in the new trilogy, and is no longer the center of either the actions or themes of the new story. 

I think him becoming a bitter cynic who no longer believes in the Jedi religion is perfectly sensible but there's no need to cover that descent in detail because that's not his role in the story anymore. His role is to pass on what he's learned to the new generation of hero, to become filled with a new hope at their determination, cast off his bitterness, and then sacrifice himself to advance the cause while passing on the torch to the next generation.

Like this is even,  unlike some of the other stuff, actually just fucking bog-standard storytelling trope stuff. ""Young scrappy hero wants to be trained by old master, master doesn't want to train them and thinks it's pointless, scrappy hero perseveres, gets training, rekindles the old master's belief in the cause, old master dies saving the hero or setting up their victory"" is just like. It's been done a million times.","Ive already started, someone there made a meme about how the last season was bad and I cried so hard and believed so much that they stopped!

Had GRRM been hit by a bus the day after they the first season premiered, would it still be his fault? They bought a work unfinished which is always a foolish venture. 

Hell, HBO could have bought the rights and waited until all the books were out even to start. They had no rules to follow. GRRM was never contractually obligated with HBO to complete the books in any timeframe, so how is it his fault for being slow? ADWD was already famously delayed when they got into the game. Even another delay of that length would mean there is no book 7 for the end of the show.

When you agree to be a showrunner you become the CEO of the show. Part of the job is that the blame falls to you if everything implodes. D&D agreed to that responsibility in 2010 or so and GRRM never did.

Going to heavy disagree here. TFA, in the small picture, does recreate Rebels vs Empire. But it is very explicit that the New Republic is the power in the galaxy, the First Order is on the fringes of the galaxy outside New Republic control, that the Resistance is a local group fighting the First Order in that section of the galaxy, and that the New Republic is funding / helping the Resistance by proxy. 

The First Order is explicitly *not* all powerful. It is a regional power in that section of the galaxy. 

So while its basically ANH 2.0 on the small picture which we mostly see, the bigger universe is *vastly* different than ANH had. That is until TLJ was like ""lol jk for no reason whatsoever First Order controls the galaxy"".

> It then establishes a bunch of mystery boxes- Who are Rey's Parents? Who is this Snoke? Why was Luke hiding?

Are we just calling all foreshadowing / mysteries 'mystery boxes' now?

> This created an impossible ask for any sequel; resolve these unresolved mysteries in a way that satisfies all fans in the midst of a story and setting that lacks any cohesion and that banks on nostalgia by basically invalidating the plot of the original trilogy.

Not remotely. One, the middle film doesn't need to solve all of them. Two, Rian Johnson very much intentionally chose the *least* satisfying answers, and often times the answers that canonically *make no sense*, because he thinks a 'good' film can be measured in how upset you make the audience. He thinks purposefully giving unsatisfying answers is how you 'subvert' the audience's expectations, and he also thinks subversion for the sake of subversion is a good plot device. Its genuinely 100% terrible.

Just off the top of my head, Rey's parentage didn't really matter. It wasn't as emphasized as everyone tries to make it seem it was in TFA. Its there but overall unimportant, and any answer will do (although the delivery in TLJ seems very deliberate in a 'fuck anything that could happen there' category, although funnily if the leaks are true...). The actual mystery is how Rey is so talented in the Force (which had a possibility of being answered by parentage), because there were many hints that this was a plot thread. Kylo seemed overly upset for just a 'random girl', it seemed like he knew something. But TLJ didn't resolve any of that, it just made it worse by giving her more power for no reason.

Snoke / First Order in general could use more expansion, at the moment all we have about them is that they are space nazis and want to rule the galaxy. When you come form the OT to the sequels, that kind of difference could use an explanation.

Luke hiding is hinted at being related to the destruction of his academy in TFA. There are many ways to resolve this without destroying Luke / his whole character arc in the OT. I dig Luke feeling he failed to such a degree that he goes into exile. That's fine. But *how* he failed is important. Luke attempting to murder his nephew for kinda thinking he might go dark side one day is a terrible reason when the whole OT ended with him believing in a father he barely knew to be good. Its nonsensical. Have Luke go out for milk or something and come back to his academy destroyed by Snoke (who also kidnaps some of them for the Knights of Ren / his guards / Kylo), it helps expand on how Snoke came to power and it gives Luke a legitimate reason to go super depressed in a corner of the galaxy. Genuinely isn't that hard to spend 5 seconds coming up with better answers than Rian Johnson did (because, again, Rian Johnson *explicitly* aims for the *least satisfying* conclusion to any given scene/ plot thread because he thinks that's good storytelling lol).

> The problem is, besides this literally being what both of his mentors did, that literally any other explanation for why Luke hid himself on a remote planet and tried to avoid being found is going to be far worse.

Not at all. I already gave one half ass reason that's already 100 times better than ""luke tried to murder his sleeping defenseless nephew"". There are so many more. Maybe Luke was *too* nice and didn't stop Kylo, who then accidentally lops off someone's arm, which prompts to him kicking Kylo out of the academy and then Kylo joining Snoke and destroying Luke's Academy in vengeance. Maybe Luke ended up in a situation where he had to fight Snoke / First Order (or maybe just some wild animals) with some students and lost some of them, say Kylo's GF and Kylo blames him for it, resulting in him being bitter and defecting to Snoke etc etc. 

It genuinely isn't hard to come up with more believable and true to character ways for Luke to get depressed and feel he failed, and to seek guidance at the original temple.

Like, if you're saying Luke being a hermit is one of the best ways for the plot, then I agree. I just vehemently disagree on the why, and it is a very important why. Also I feel there are other legitimate reasons for a non depressed Luke to not interfere with current conflicts. But I think being depressed has better narrative qualities and would allow the new characters to shine as opposed to just sitting back and let Luke take care of everything (even though I wouldn't be against that either)",">Understanding Luke isn't in the new trilogy because Luke isn't the fucking protagonist

This is the worst argument I have ever seen for destroying a character. You know what using that logic Lando wasn't the protagonist in Solo so it would be perfectly acceptable to you to make that character a giant spider that shoots icecream and never explain it because it doesn't matter because Lando isn't the protagonist?

>We don't need a point-by-pount account of Luke's attempts to train the new generation of Jedi, a full account of his failure, and to witness him struggle and fail to come to terms with it

You know what that sounds like? A legitimately interesting movie. But regardless you are right, we don't need 2 hours of a 2 and a half hour movie to establish any of that. You know what we need? One damn scene, like maximum of 5 minutes, showing Luke training and failing Kylo. We do not need everything to be spelled out, but we do need it there because then Luke's character makes sense. You're defending lazy writing by taking criticisms other people have and exploding them out of proportion, when the actual solution is stupendously simpler. Actually here's the exact spot they could have had it. You remember when Luke is talking to Rey about almost killing Kylo? And they have those flashback shots of Luke almost killing Kylo? Yeah like during that, kind of at the beginning of the speech, Luke could have been like ""I was a bad teacher"" and then shots of Kylo yelling at Luke, getting angry, and Luke checking the sacred texts and nothing changing. You know quick shots, real quick, so that we get the information that Luke tried the Jedi way, and the Jedi way failed. Simple, fast, slots into the movie perfectly. We don't need everything spelled out, we just need it to exist.

Now. I'm sorry. Luke Skywalker. One of the most IMPORTANT people in the entire history of this civilization and you think we don't need to understand him?

Contractually it was out of GRRMs control and that was HBOs choice. GRRM did not create the show or dictate how it would go. If he is guilty of letting anyone down it is book readers and not show watchers. 

I just don't get where this defense comes from. It doesnt matter what other writers did or how many words he wrote or what he told them in a non-legally binding way, the show was the responsibility of HBO and the profits stood to benefit its shareholders, not GRRM.

You can disagree I guess but how does that assign all the blame to a guy who wasn't in the writers room? Someone who had no say in casting or writing or how long seasons would be or the number of those seasons.

If book 3 took 2 seasons, then 4/5 should have taken three at least, which means if D&D had not accelerated things the end of season 7 would have been Jons death. They cut out stuff like stoneheart and faegon without knowing how integral those plots would be to the endgame. Even with his material they made huge changes and never ever thought about what they were adding up to. What good would TWOW have been to them if those two plots and stuff like northern politics and the faceless men messing with the citadel dictated how things went? All that was cut when they had material to work with.

Blaming GRRM full stop only makes sense if you dont look at the full picture. It was never his job or obligation to do anything for the show, the info he shared he did out of the kindess of his heart. And if your business relies on the favors of others to work then you have a bad business.

They could have gone that route.,"OMG stop with this. The Iron Fleet was NOT built on that island, the REAVERS REAVED all coastal areas jeebus",Lol,Suspension of belieffffff,The book was better. Euron presented a magical horn that can enslave dragons. Of course people will vote for him. The show didn’t make sense at all.,"Plus, like... why was nobody saying ""Yeah sure Euron. Now that you say it, we will build a gigantic Aramada. Of course. Why haven't we thought of that before? Gee. That would have come in handy at various points in our history, but I guess we really needed some gallivantin' asshole to tell us.""","And the ships euron had were sleek and armored and massive.

Yara and theon took all the ships available with them. The iron islands revolve around their ship pride, some being handed down generation's, getting upgraded along the way.

But dem thousand ships that were made yesterday? Euron must be ceo of SpaceX","\>  shows up suspiciously right after the king dies 

&#x200B;

in the tv series he even tells the iron islands that he killed his brother...","Ironic as euron in the books, once again, is one of the best characters. Fuck DD",Where is this fucking forest. Did they plant it and it grew into the beach in a week?,"Tbf, in the books and histories, the whole MIA ironborn brother returns and usurps King thing is pretty normal for the Iron Islands","They could have said, ""Go steal me a thousand ships"", and even if it's still unlikely, I would have bought it more than a tiny island building an enormous fleet with no resources.","Bro, you're just not alpha enough to understand it. Euron was the legendary alpha meant to lead against all the beta cuck mainlanders.","Euron's ship resemble Greek Triremes and other ships of the ancient Mediterranean. These were incredibly expensive. At the height of their power, Athens, Carthege, and Rome never had more than 400 of these at the same time. Building a Greek Trireme took about 6,000 mandays, so actually building a thousand ships would have cost 6,000,000 man days. Therefore, to complete those ships even within a year (let alone more quickly) would require 16,400 workers skilled in ship building. It would also require an enormous number of large, mature trees. According to Homer, Odysseus built his ship from 20 mature trees, so Euron's fleet would have required 20,000 trees. Neither the number of men nor trees required is anywhere near realistic for the Ironborn.","He explicitly calls out that he killed balon as well. Apparently they are all just ok with brother killing now but somehow theon, as king of winterfell, is a monster for the murder of two kids during a war.","He actually tells them he killed the king. He paid the “iron price”. You keep what you kill and they are all for that. 

Fuck this show though. Will never rewatch.","Yeah. In-universe, Bravos can build, on average, one ship per day. And even that is considered insane by the standards of the setting.","I thought Euron’s introduction was perfect, it just all went downhill from there. Euron is a hype-man, and everything about how he presents himself is tailored to appeal to the Ironborn and get them to vote for him. (Being a man is basically everything for most Ironborn, as they are a violently misogynistic people) 

As for the fleet, Pyke is described as barren in the books as well, but it’s the Iron IslandS, with an S. There are trees elsewhere, and more to be stolen from the mainland shore. 

Everything after that was the problem. It was absurd to suggest Yara was able to steal all of their ships. And then they took away is powers but still had him do impossible things, while giving him the personality of a frat boy.","Thing is people forgave them for this sort of bullshit because the previous seasons were very good, and everyone just hoped these failures would be a one-off thing and the show would improve again. Only it didn't.",We put up with it cause we expected the pay off to be worth it in end. It wasn’t and the rest is history,"When you have built up enough trust with your audience, they will forgive errors later because they will expect those errors to result in some future consequence in the story: that's what stories are.

The problem is, beginning in season 5, those errors start accumulating - and Game of Thrones had built up so much goodwill with the audience that they were ready to forgive a lot. Until you get to the final season, where we only have 6 episodes to bring consequences to 4 error-filled seasons.

That's why Season 8 was so highly anticipated, it had SO MUCH to accomplish to remedy issues going back to season 5/6/7, not to mention where the story arcs left off in season 4, and the overall arc of white walkers and Dany's invasion of Westeros.

That's why when they were like, ""We're only going to do 6 episodes, but they're going to be movie length"" it actually sounded good, like they understood how much remained - people expected LOTR + Hobbit trilogies, or the Harry Potter Saga, to wrap everything up.

So when we got some of the worst writing ever put on television, it was an unfathomable fall from audience expectations. ""Suffering is the difference between expectations and reality"", expectations were sky-high, and the reality (writing) was 6 feet under, and the result was a Icarian fall.",I watched till the end but the Sand Snakes is when I realized the quality was over.,"I liked the arya story line, i dont know what people hate so much about it. That might be because I started watching it late and I binge watched up to season 6 though",I put part of the blame on the fanbase for letting the show slip away,And there's only ever like 20 of them,"Yeah, that’s always been my problem with this particular meme. There’s more than one island. Pyke is barren, but the others aren’t.

Excellent points about the Ironborn. I still can’t believe we got Dagmer Cleftjaw without giving him a cleft-jaw.","They scaled them down a lot. For example in A Clash of Kings Theon is given command of 8 ships to raid the coast, in S2 he's given a single ship.

I get that it's mainly for production reasons. But it does leave the Iron Islanders looking like a pretty sorry group",This is the same way I count reps when working out,1 2 skip a few 99 a thousand,\- Me doing push ups,and stealth technology,"Which, as with pretty much everything about him, would have made sense if they’d followed the book. He has an army of priests and sorcerers that help his fleet move impossibly fast. They tried to give him the results without the power to achieve them.",And making invaders kind of forget.,"ah, so smart, only a genius writer could come up with such subtle hidden gems","Not only that, but he actually read the books and boasted before filming that Euron would make Ramsay look like a little kid. Because he expected Euron to at least be a little bit like the book version.","To be fair to the incredible costume designers, apparently the rock n’ asshole biker aesthetic was Pilou’s idea","Dont forget they also destroyed the other Iron Fleet. You know, the massive fleet crewed by the same people with the same skills and knowledge, who were wiped out in under an hour by their own peers...",Didn't even get a montage.,**A finger in da bum**,My master points out that men don&#39;t need nipples.,"Ah, that would explain why Varys' ship sank.","Little known fact, the best wood for boat building in all of Westeros is Euron's morning wood.",Manned an army out of his pants! He must be miraculously returned lord Frey.,Remember this is the same season that CGI'ed a wide shot of the Golden Company in front of King's Landing and totally forgot to give them any kind of shadow so they looked pasted in.,"Lowballing it, assuming they built all 1,000 ships and assuming (generously) each ship has a crew of 50, they'd need to produce 50,000 men when Yara just ran off with the Iron Fleet.",I would give you a gold if I have.,I’m pretty sure gunpowder was invented in GoT yet,They didn't have cannons.,"I know, but it was still in very short time made.",I don't get why they didn't bring in the horn in the show. Euron could have killed Rhaegal with it and it would have made sense and we would have avoided the episode 4 nonsense...,"Book euron was honestly one of the most intimidating characters in the whole series. Psychotic pirate sorcerer? Hell yeah

Show euron just wanted to fuck the queen",I want to seduce the dragon! Blows his horn! *Rolls 1d20*,"Whoa so in theory we could had Dany, The night King and Cersei all have one dragon each.",Tbh I hated him in the book too,Well to be fair in the show It was Euron vs Yara only and Euron was a man.,"not only enslave dragons but literally melt the insides of people when he blew it. Book Euron was similar to Odin in many ways, show Euron is ACTUALLY Captain Jack Sparrow.","You might enjoy a reread of that chapter, the horn is magical, but I don't think it is dragons that it influences.","The show replaced the horn with his dick, and dragons with cersei.","Nah, Euron sucks in the books too. Another slow down plot advancement character.","That's literally how D&D views it. They don't have a reasonable grasp of a medieval society. You see characters pitch ideas that D&D clearly thinks are supposed to be brilliant, yet anyone with a reasonable grasp of the time period will quickly deduce that it is utterly moronic.

""Why don't we just build a thousand ships?""

""Why don't I just get everyone I dislike into one place and murder them?""

""What if we create an elected monarchy, where the nobles choose the King? That's almost as good as democracy, which is always inherently good, right?""

Funnily enough, the smartest suggestion regarding government policy in Season 7 and 8 actually came from Bronn. Building brothels is a good idea.  King's Landing is going to need a lot of workers to be fully repaired, and those workers are going to need something to do. If the government owns the brothels, then this ensures that some of the coin the workers receive will eventually find its way back to the government.",I thought it was an unspoken truth that Euron killed Old Man Greyjoy and all the Iron Islanders just kinda figured that was the way of things.,Really? I found him to be one of the worst characters GRRM wrote up till that point. He is basically a walking Deus Ex Machina/edgelord OC even in the books,"The funny thing is it took Dany, what 6 seasons? to acquire ships. But Euron magically gets them overnight. Such a joke!",And they'd occasionally throw in an episode that was comparatively amazing and you'd forgive it. Season 5 had Hardhome. Season 6 had Battle of the Bastards/Winds of Winter.,"All the islands are supposed to be barren, with their major export being iron. 

The way the iron islands are supposed to have gone is the people on there lived a sea faring life, had access to weapons but not much else and thought mining was beneath them. They first raided for more wood to further their conflicts within, but then realized it was better to just raid other wealthier places. Additionally they could get thralls(slaves) to do the mining for them. They built a lifestyle that required constant raiding and warfare. They became a sort of half-viking half-spartan society, with the men becoming more and more focused on being raiders and capturing slaves to do the work supporting the raiding and collecting tributes.

However a unified Westeros was far more powerful even in the sea than the Iron Islands. Once the Targaryen's united the realms that was it.

Pyke is supposed to be way bigger than it's displayed as, it's the 3rd largest of 31 islands.",Only when babes walk in.,And anti air missile batteries,"Well he had magical fuccboi pirate powers, so...","Is there any indication in the books that he uses magic to sail his ship faster?

I don't think they even considered killing a dragon until they'd already started writing s8.

They didn't plan ahead because they are shitty writers.",Because Dumbfuck and Dickweed wanted to get the fantasy out of a fantasy story.,"Imagine how fucking bad ass his reveal could have been with a fucking full set of Valyrian steel armor with a horn that could enslave (or change it to being able to kill) a dragon.

When they brought those giant chains out of nowhere and people kept complaining about it I kept saying I guarantee it'll make sense because they're going to do some weird shit with how the night king is connected to Bran and saw through time to plan the dragon kill or something. 

Then it turned out to legitimately just be bad writing.","So true.   They started all these elaborate story lines with no way out of them.  So in season 5 they just started to shoddily kill off characters and lazily wrap up story lines.   To me the beginning of the end was roose Bolton’s hasty murder, followed by Ramsey with bonus death Rickon and his plot.  Instead of relying on story telling they had to try and use cinematography. Like who thought Ramsey would beat Jon?  Nobody.  But the battle *was* beautiful.  Or Varys and little finger.  So much hype.  So much mystery.

She is blamed for starting the war but her capturing Tyrion did not start the war as Ned would have still found out the secret, still confessed to Cersei who would have killed Robert and captured Ned anyways

She is blamed for Ned accepting the hand's position but if she had not convinced Ned to accept the hand's position Ned would have made an enemy of the king, no way Robert travels a million miles over months and takes no for an answer, not with Cersei constantly reminding her about it

She is blamed for making Ned trust littlefinger, when littlefinger has fooled every single person including Tywin and Tyrion and would have taken in Ned anyways

I'm not going to say that misogamy isn't a large part, but I'd say a lot of it is just that the incident with Jon that starts us off and colors everything after, he is our protagonist after all, strikes a cord because it is relatable.  A lot of folks have or care about people that have experiences with step parents that treat kids poorly.  (I know that their relationship is more complicated than that but that is the closest real world analogue I can think of and it is one that I know some people have connected to emotionally.)  The characters that really infuriate people are the ones that are relatable like that.

There was no misogyny there.

Granted he/she was still wrong and it's not what happened but you're acting like he/she said some horrible anti-woman mantra, when he/she just hates a character in a book/tv series, and then you're attempting to paint a whole sub of people as something awful because of it. Just stop looking for something that's not there so you can feel like youre valiantly fighting some horrid giant machination, when it isn't that deep and he/she just dislikes a character from a work of fiction.

Does nothing when his friend(who was in the Nights Watch) advocated for treason. His sisters do the same thing. Not only does he not try to keep them in line, he specifically shares information with them that he himself learned of when his friends tried to use it against the queen.

Aemon didn't come up until after Dany had killed a ton of people because it would have made Jon look like an asshole and highlighted the shitty storytelling.

Aemon becoming a maester was supposed to get rid of his claim to the throne, but he had to double down on that decision when this happened.

So. Much. Foreshadowing.

Lol... can you really not tell the difference between Dany and those other character? Oof.

I mean, did those other characters threaten to raze EVERY CITY THEY EVER VISITED? Did they burn POWS alive, or kill people not guilty of crimes to instill fear?

This was mostly an issue with D&D's writing. The Targs enemies have a vested interest in making them seems unfit to rule. The writers had a similar issues of treating specific povs like they were fact. Catlyn thought that Edmure was a bit of an idiot so they wrote him like an idiot. Some of the characters thought that Tywinn was actually a good leader so they wrote the story like he was a good leader. They missed that the god's flip a coin thing was not supposed to be treated as fact. A look at the Targ family tree will tell you that half of them aren't crazy. 

They didn't even bother to actually include what Jaehaerys II actually said.

 *King Jaehaerys once told me that* [*madness*](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Targaryen_madness) *and greatness were two sides of the same coin.

In hindsight we should treasure that episode in some ways, since we would never again see wight animals like Old Nan alluded to (the bear) or see the NK do any meaningful fighting after his spear throw.

The problem with that episode is that their motivation and strategy just made no sense whatsoever and it was pretty obviously just D&D wanting the NK to get a dragon and backing their way into it. They wanted that visual spectacle for Season 8 and chose it over anything that could be called reasonable storytelling.

I explicitly said that Rhaella was one of the good ones, and I didn't say that Rhaegar was mad, I said that he was a big failure. And considering the fact that Rhaegar abandoned his sick wife and small children to have a fuck fest with a teenager ""for the greater good"" and started a civil war by doing so, I'd say that's a rather fair observation.

So much for the Mad Queen arc development.","The thing that bothered me most about the episode where they get the wight, is why the fuck didn’t they just get the random dude that died right away and wait for him to turn.

For instance, when the king was being held hostage and threatened with death, Tywin himself basically said it was not really that bad if he did die because then they would have a much better king (meaning Rhaegar). I think a lot of people in Westeros are aware that kidnapping/rape would be very out of character for him and unlikely, but when Robert was on the throne the last thing you would want is to say anything that makes you sound like a Targaryen supporter. So his version of the story spreads, but I doubt it was believed as firmly as it seems.

I don’t see what’s the big deal in the Targaryens getting to survive or having a continuation of their family line, they’re not all that special besides the dragons. Which there weren’t even any legitimately powerful dragons for a long time until Daenerys came around. Also there’s a reason Jon gets sent back to the nights watch at the end of the show and that is something we know will happen in the books.

Fuck sake....","This.

Targaryens aren't mad. They are obsessive.

The ""Great"" Targaryens are ones who became obsessed with something positive, and successfully achieved their goals. The ""Mad"" Targaryens are those who were obsessed with things that were either awful or literally unattainable.

If you look at Aerys's rein, he was just constantly flipping from one obsession to the next. He wanted to build a new wall, even further north than the old one. He wanted to build a brand new capital from scratch. He wanted to build a canal through Dorne, and make it green. When Tywin became more popular than him, he started making decisions for the sole purpose of spiting House Lannister.

Then the Defiance of Duskendale happened, where Aerys was captured, mocked, and possibly tortured. He had the Lord of Duskendale burned alive, and that's where he developed his paranoia, his ruthlessness, and his obsession with fire all in one go.

Rhaegar was obsessed with prophecy. Viserys was obsessed with reclaiming his birthright. Daenerys was obsessed with liberation and being seen as a messiah. Jon was obsessed with... not wanting things, I guess.","They were cruel. Viserys sold his sister as a slave and threatened to cut out her baby when she began to gain influence. 

Aerys burned people alive and would rather burn his entire city down than have his rule questioned.

Aerys got off on burning people alive, tortured his mistress and her whole family to death and sexually abused Rhaella so violently that his kingsguards could hear her screams whilst standing in front of his chamber.

They were monsters.","It wasn’t his duty to kill her, the Night’s Watch wasn’t created to kill Wildlings. Like he said, they just happen to been in the wrong side of the wall when she was built.

First Ranger Uncle Benjen talked of it, so did Craster and Mance. The scene I'm referring to killing Ygritte was exactly what he was supposed to to and did not. The Wall was built originally yes for the WhiteWalkers called the Others in the books but to act like that's all the Night Watch was for by the time this takes place you are either taking the piss or need a rewatch.","Yeah that happens to plenty of families in Westeros the Targaryens are not special in that regard.

Robb, Catelyn, Ned, and Rickon were all massacred because of the numerous wars and battles the starks took part in.

Imagine how cool a show would have been that played around the time of Bran the Builder that showed all events leading to the construction of the Wall if the White Walkers had been a true menace to everything living in the whole of Westeros. Now, the first season of such a show would just be meme fodder and there would be no second season...

&#x200B;

I find it also funny, that they are planning spin-off shows that focus more on the Targaryens and their dragons when it was DnD's expressed wish to have less magic elements to draw in the housewife and football player crowd. I mean, the subtle mix of realism and magic was what made GoT stand out in contrast to other fantasy shows.

By S8, tons of people were talking about it, everyone would discuss the episodes and what things might mean, new communities and viewing parties popped up, and mostly people were being very protective for each other about not dropping any spoilers for people who had DVR’d it to watch when they had the time. I liked all that.","I think they stuck the landing with Sanaa’s character arc in terms of hating the North and taking her family for granted as a child and learning to be a true Queen by the end, just not the type of Queen she wished to be.",The cinematography was genuinely really well done and reflected the budget increase since the start of the show.,I liked it better then season 7!,"They recreated the city of Kings Landing irl or a part of it, but still.

It was just as awful as the rest of the season. No definitive ending, no drawn out fight, just, ""meh, they'll both fall into the fire and fuck it.""

Horribly pathetic writing and such a massive anti-climax to the entire brotherly feud. It was absolute trash as a scene, and it's even fucking worse when you compare it to the Mountain vs Oberyn fight, which was amazingly done and one of the best scenes in the show. 

Just another example of the final season not paying off storylines, or paying them off horribly wrong and/or shitty. No surprise, sucked just as many dicks as everything else in s8.","It contained Cleganes, yet nary a soup vessel in sight. And the shots of the Qy going bye looked atrocious.

Yeah he took a dagger through the eye and just kept going, but the night king also took a full on blast of dragon fire, and threw so many dead at Jon that he physically couldnt get to him. In the end NK got stabbed and The Mountain just sort of fell.","Dropped the show after the night kings death, never finished it and don’t even care, will wait for the books","I had a whole theory that Qyburn was able to revive The Mountain through use of Necromancy (which is what got him booted from The Maesters) which was activated when Dany hatched the dragons, bringing magic back.

I thought eventually The Night King would wrest control of The Mountain away from Cersei after a battle of wills. I thought magic was going to play a larger part, it was hinted at in the books, suddenly street magicians were doing real magic, Pyromancers were suddenly producing more wildfire... it was going to be great.

The Mountain was a character were considerably more familiar with. His influence on the story and characters was enormous, and the show had built up the conflict between the brothers to a huge degree. I'm not saying the conclusion to that conflict was the best. But the fact that the show took much more effort and time depicted over his death than the Night King perhaps isn't to me an issue. As a character it was relatively well deserved. And it did a fair bit of justice to his brother too, though again that doesn't mean I'm happy with the writing or his arc in general.

No. It turns out that to kill the night King you have to first be trained by the first sword of bravos, then you have to get experience travelling with various groups of armed men and finally you need to learn the secrets of the faceless men. Then you only need to use all those skills you've learned to sneak past an army of walkers and get into the right position at the right time to strike the fatal blow...

Of all the things to nit pick in this show (and there are many) this isn't it. It was pretty obvious to anyone that Arya was being trained as a classic Rogue, complete with skill points in dagger and rapier and sneak. When you consider the existence of the Valerian steel dagger then honestly anyone who didn't see this coming at least as a possibility was really not thinking hard.",He didn't do nearly as much damage nor was it necessary to not confront him directly/kill him with subterfuge.  Not really a good point honestly.,The mountain was already dead,I mean it was said forever that dragon glass/valyrian steel is a one hit kill on the white walkers.,"Nonsense. Fans felt that anticlimax so hard, but really think about it. The Night King was responsible for the entire white walker army. He killed countless. And his march past the wall was met by the only prepared resistance, and it came so close. It was a single skill Arya had crafted that brought him down. A single moment of stealth and dexterity.

Cinematically, the fight between the Hound and the Mountain is so good. But this whole, the Night King was ""easy"" to kill? That makes no narrative sense.",No he wasn’t.

Dany and co now go for the throne, but Euron kills Rhaegal and Cersei captures Miss Sunday and kills her. Mountain executes. Dany burns down the city in rage because some bells drove her mad. Jaime kills Euron who makes fun of him and then reunites with Cersei and they die together.

The Mountain is just a big guy that was nearly killed by a shrimpy guy.  Then killed outright by a slightly smaller big guy.

Granted, the attempts on the Mountains life were more spread out and not all occurring in the span of a single episode, but the NK was harder to kill by far.  The NK tanked freaking dragonfire and the combined plotarmors of Jon and Theon.

I was stupefied when the fight started, there was NOTHING leading up to it.

I would have much preferred for them to make some risky plot choices and miss rather than getting the plot equivalent of plain oatmeal made with water, without any fruit, butter, sugar or salt.

GRRM had the Hodor twist written for years, he gave that to them in good faith. A time travel plot twist involving a character with an insanely powerful ability, hinted at by Ned hearing Bran's voice at the Tower of Joy. 

When Bran said ""I have to go now"" to Theon, I was hoping there was going to be some amazing reveal, perhaps involving whatever Bran and Tyrion spoke about off-screen by the fireplace. That was me thinking this was an epic tale though and not some fucking kids' show where a plot device like that is shown as a foreshadowing of something so mundane that only makes sense once you've seen the whole thing. The reason Bran and Tyrion talked by the fire was so Tyrion could suggest him as King, that's literally it. The Stark women were against Dany because they knew she would have a sudden 180 degree heel turn. None of the foreshadowing actually makes any sense until the future events happen, which is trash writing no matter how you spin it. Her burning dissidents was an example of decent foreshadowing that things would go poorly, the Starks hating someone who has done so much for everyone with no valid reason is an example of shitty foreshadowing.

This is a fantasy story. GRRM likely told them Bran ends up as king because he's pretty much a demigod, the show however showed us nothing, except the Hodor stuff, which was quickly dropped due to them not wanting to take any risks.",That's true.

Considering how easy it became to kill them, facing them head-on like they did was incredibly stupid. They would have been better off manning the walls of Winterfell with archers and firing hundreds of thousands of dragonglass tipped arrows from the walls of Winterfell.

The only way the Wights were dangerous was if they swarmed someone. Very few have weapons. They rip people apart mostly or perhaps suffocate their victims.

Plus the Night King is a White Walker or an ""Other"" as they're called in the books and the strongest one at that, he's not just a Wight and he knows everything that can kill him.  The way he was killed and the fact he had Arya by the throat and didn't crush her windpipe with his super strong White Walker hand, or freeze and shatter her like they can do to a steel sword is what made it a weak ass way for the most feared being of the entire series to go out.","Are you ashamed of me, Father?","In fairness, Sam wasn’t exactly fond of his father and brother.

You know she showed off her newly matrix downloaded skill of throwing daggers to Gendry. At King's Landing one good dagger throw some spilled wine and one less Lannister and it would have been over. The Hound could have still has his tete -a- tete with The Mountain that rides and Brienne because you know she would would have, could have comforted Jamie. He could probably kick her in the arse and she would say it's okay and forgive him.

Daenarys could come to her senses and send Mr. I don wan it to the wall and You Got Edd killed Sam the Useless with him. Keep her promise to Yara, give Edmure the Riverlands,and work something out with Dorne.

Dracarys Tyrion because Ellaria was right you can never trust a Lannister and it will finally shut him up being smart and being a smartass are not the same though it apparently confuses some. And because it also seems to be true of Starks banish Sansa and Bran to the Riverlands because their are no Weirwoods in the south, dragon beats raven, Sansa is a put up job, and Arya can complain but fire beats magic stick fighting and dagger throwing and smart aleck comebacks everytime and there's nothing they can do about it. As far as The North, there is someone there who will have no problem ruling it. Starks aren't magic or special pass the tiki torch.

After finally getting to sit on the Iron Throne to say she did, Daenerys can have Drogon melt it down and reform a new chair into something comfortable and fit for a Queen.","Let it be clear that in order for a nation to become independent they must defeat the ruling power in question. The north declared themselves independent but never defeated the crown, just the Bolton’s (and the houses that supported them), which, were a northern house. 🤷🏻‍♀️","Wanting the men to rest was in no way encoring Cersei's rule.   Sansa wanted their armies to be as near peak condition as they could be.   Varys himself said waiting would give even more Houses time to turn against Cersei.   He said they were turning but Ms. ""I need my crown NOW"" Targaryen couldn't wait.   

In their one on one, Sansa continuously used the phrase ""We"" when talking about the war with Cersei.   I don't know why The Breaker of Chains could tell Sansa, with the North's help in securing my Throne, I will grant Independence and name the North a Forever friend of the crown.   But nope, the wannabe center of the Universe had to have ALL people beneath her heel.  I guess her nickname should have been ""The Maker of Chains.""

And Dany was calling the war for the living Jon's war.   It was her perception that was faulty.   I guess she was in a mood because the North wasn't giving her, her customary ego bath.  No crowd surfing makes ""Baby Dany"" cranky.","Literally no one in the North forgot about Cersei.   
They were willing to help Dany destroy Cersei, in return for her helping them destroy the NK. 

""And what happens afterwards? **We** defeat the dead, **we** destroy Cersei""

It was an **even exchange**, as long as they kept their independance. But It didn't work out, because Daenerys required total submission, not unlike Cersei.",All great except why should Brienne accept Jaime's kick in the ass? Better  he dies trying to save Cersei. Arya could get a twofer.,On point!,Why would she send Jon to the wall,Do you think Robert would have given the North  independence?  No.  Cersei sure as hell wouldn't have.   But apparently Sansa can go behind Jons back (he was King) and not even offer anything in exchange like Yara did.,"Cerise sent Bronn to murder Tyrion and Jaime before the Long Night even began. She didn't GAF about anyone's rest or anybody's time. She was the most well-rested and newly stocked with armies from everywhere. 

I've said before that I understand both Sansa and Daenerys here. Yes, the soldiers do need some rest and recuperation, but also, Cersei literally said ""we will deal with whatever is left of you"" and you know she doesn't fight fair, so knowing the path is clear and the soldiers are tired gives her a perfect chance to strike.

She put them in a position where either choice could go wrong.

Dany also didn't ask for the North in exchange for fighting with them. She PLEDGED HER ARMIES BEFORE JON EVEN BENT THE KNEE. S8 rewrote a lot of shit, but never forget that in Season 7, she'd seen the NK and he'd murdered her DRAGON. That was enough for her to pledge to fight him. And then he decided to kneel. Which means the North could have still been independent when Dany came North, but JON CHOSE TO KNEEL. She didn't make him, she didn't blackmail him, he CHOSE to do it. 

""fighting jon's war"" was the shittiest revisionist writing i'd ever seen. Dany saw the NK and his army. That was what made her fight the war for humanity. Diminishing her as some dumbass who only fights a war because she's in LoVe was an insult to our intelligence.","Lmao what on Earth are you on about? That discussion between Dany and Sansa was interrupted. Miss wannabe-center-of-the-universe was the one who even wanted to have a conversation, whereas Miss Smartest-person-that-Arya-has-ever-seen never even tried to have a conversation about it afterwards, she just kept throwing Dany dirty looks when Dany was making strategic moves.

As for wanting the armies to be in peak condition, LMFAO. Sansa wasn't even ready to admit Dany helped them in any way, and all but bit Arya's head off for agreeing with Jon that they needed her. She didn't want the armies to rest, she was just stalling because she wanted to back out of the bargain. And looking at the Northern armies actions in KL, they didn't actually need the rest.

After all is said and done though, Dany didn't even have to bother to have a conversation with Sansa, she was just the lady of WF, and the King in the North already gave his word. Sansa going back on it is like Benjen giving Robert attitude after Ned already bent the knee.",">Sansa wanted their armies to be as near peak condition as they could be.

The vast majority of their men would have been sleeping outside. In the North. During Winter. That seem like a sound plan to you?

>Varys himself said waiting would give even more Houses time to turn against Cersei.   He said they were turning

Do you believe everything people say? What houses was he talking about? Who was even supporting Cersei in the first place? The only one we saw was House Tarly. They weren't a problem anymore. Even if there were others, why would more time cause them to switch sides? If Cersei blowing up the Sept and not having any legal right to the throne didn't do it...","that wasn't the exchange.

Their KING IN THE NORTH had already bent the knee. Their deal wasn't even a deal. Dany pledged herself to the long night without asking anything in return, and Jon bent the knee because of that. The north is now under her rule. Which means those armies are under her command. Which means there's nothing to debate when it comes to traveling south.","It didn't work because Sansa opposed Daenerys at every turn and plotted to stage a coup and overthrow her on the eve of battle. Northern independence was never a  part of the agreement, Jon bent the knee and backed Daenerys claim that should have been the end of it.","Talking out of your ass, as always, huh?",I can get behind that.,Thanks. We've all had so much time to muse over it all.,"We have the gift of hindsight, he betrayed her. In this scenario she sends him to the wall before he can betray and kill her. It's mercy. She does care for him. It's really the only place for him anyway. She could never really trust him. She would be better off with Daario. At least he was loyal.",">I've said before that I understand both Sansa and Daenerys here. Yes, the soldiers do need some rest and recuperation,

Sansa's side of that argument only makes sense in an abstract way. It immediately falls apart the second you think about it. The entire thing ignores that Kings Landing is on the other end of the continent. Winterfell and Kings Landing are about 1500 miles apart. However long they wait, the men are still going to end up dealing with marching for over 500 hours. Even if we go with the shrunken version of the universe where that trip only take a trip, that's still 160 hours of walking. They were never going to be well rested. The idea that they need rest also ignores that they should have plenty of time to rest while marching south. Dany's supposed to be retaking all of the seven kingdoms. She's just going to ignore the Vale and the Riverlands? They could have stopped for weeks anywhere if that was an actual issue.

The other issue is that they seemed to forget that it was winter. If we're going with the Night King's army only killing half of theirs, there should have been roughly 45k soldiers left. I don't know how many people could fit inside Winterfell, but [this real castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak_des_Chevaliers) could only garrison 2000 men. Lets just bump that up to 5000 to be generous\*. That puts 40k soldiers outside in freezing temperatures. It would be one thing if Game of Thrones was a less realistic show, but Stannis' camp had tons of issues due to the weather in season 5. Her and Varys acting like it was reasonable for them keep their army at Winterfell for an unknown amount of time make absolutely no sense.

\*That's a highly unrealistic number. Winterfell in the books has a garrison of around 100 men at the start of the books. The Dreadfort having a wildly inflated 600 should have been the first clue that we got that he was up to something.","Also Sansa should have been happy that ms I wanna be centre of the universe, as this dumbass above puts it, had just brought her armies and dragons to save the north, but she had slapped bitch face all through the celebrations, she was just spoiling for an argument...and of course we all know how much more humane and painless, dying by starvation is /s","So why did Dany let Jorah talk her into seeking out Sansa?   Sansa was a prominent Northern figure AND She was the only reason the Vale forces stayed.  The Vale didn't give a damn about Dany or Jon.  As articulated by Tyrion, if Jon made a play for the Throne Dany would lose the Vale, ""Sansa, will see to that.""

As for their convo, I think it was pretty clear Dany's response was going to be ""Hell no.""

And Sansa said ""We'll always be grateful."" But she's still upset about giving away the farm.   Til episode 4, Sansa did her duty, grudgingly.   Greeted Dany as arriving royalty, hosted her in what I imagine were suitable accommodations, but was pissed.  Prior to the end of Episode 4 Dany got everything she was entitled to, it just bothered her that Sansa detested her.",">It didn't work because Sansa opposed Daenerys at every turn

I thought you said there were only 6 season? I saw 2 more onlin-“

“We don’t talk about those in this house”",We should do what the last air bender fandom did and pretend season 8 never existed.,Yes it is,"If anyone wants a tiny teenie little very thin silver lining to this whole GOT/D&D disaster, here is my opinion:

The world permanently lost a great story that can never be fixed. That's the true shame of this all. However, we live in a capitalist system. And what matters to capitalists is obviously money. HBO, the capitalists in this situation, lost TONS of money.

They may not fully realize it yet. But I think they are starting to do so. Disney already canned D&D, I believe, for this very reason.

Where did they lose money?

GOT should have been a long term asset with revenue generating value. Most good shows continue to generate revenue for IP owner and the artists involved for years and years. 

People continue to buy or rent the shows so they can rewatch. While HBO doesn't typically syndicate their shows, people would have considered GOT access as part of their consideration for getting HBO. Merchandising and spin-offs have great value. 

HBO could have created live events, fan shows, marketed themselves and other shows, and continued to bolster their status as a top studio for years. Having one of the greatest and most successful shows of all time is (would have been) a huge credit to their entire company.

But instead....... what do they have now?

Shit, they got shit. 

Take me as an example. I own seasons 1 through 7. I was stubborn and continued to watch/rewatch/purchase the seasons even though the last few got really bad. I fell for the sunk cost fallacy. I admit that. I was hoping they would somehow wrap it all up and fix it in the final season. Anyway, I did not buy the final season. I haven't watched any of the episodes a second time and I have no intention to do so.

I may have even kept my HBO Now subscription, maybe. But instead, I did not buy the final season. I cancelled HBO. I didn't buy any GOT related anything. I don't talk about GOT or HBO other than here. I have no intention of rewatching any of it or watching any of the spin-off and related stories. 

I'm not the only one. 

GOT buzz is gone everywhere. This is a huge blow to HBO financially. I have no way to put real numbers behind it. But I would guess the total financial loss (relative to what the IP value would  have been had the show been finished properly) is many millions of USD.

Accountants and financiers aren't stupid (most of the time). They can see this. They will analyze this disaster for years and use it as an example of how to royally screw up an IP asset and devalue their own company.

Not just HBO, but businesses everywhere will eventually (I suspect already) understand this. In business school, most textbooks not only explain theory and concepts, but also cite examples of how these concepts are applicable to the real world. HBO's GOT disaster will someday end up in one of those ""real world example"" asides in a business textbook.

Businesses will learn and hopefully not repeat the same mistake. They will no longer allow an untalented arrogant lazy couple of douchebags like D&D destroy an entire multi-million dollar asset. Business executives will look at someone like Benioff and say ""what exactly are your credentials again?"". You want complete control of this whole project? Go fuck yourself, and your buddy Weiss too. 

It's one thing for a director to screw up one movie that could have had lots of potential. But to screw up an entire multi-billion Dollar franchise that could have generated many millions for many more years is unforgivable in the eyes of a capitalist.

So I guess, in some ways, we can all appreciate the sacrifice GOT made for the future benefit of human civilization.",I'm rewatching it with my mum and this is where we are gonna finish. I dont want to ruin this show for her,"This is what I tell everyone who hasn't seen it.  Go through season 6, then for the love of God, STOP!","This IS how it ended. This is the last time the show really stirred something in me, ya know?

I’ve read the books, loved them, but I think if the show ended at the end of Season 4, I could accept that.

Tyrion gets revenge and doesn’t get a happy ending either, instead he flees for his life, accompanied by Varys. Stannis arrives beyond the wall, saving the Night’s Watch and restoring the castles along the wall, finally doing some good in the world. Danaerys takes over Meereen, driving out the masters and overseeing the day-to-day runnings of her newly conquered provinces. Sansa also escapes to the vale, escaping the Lannister’s and leading a life with Baelish, for good or ill. Arya leaves Westeros, choosing a life with the Faceless Men over poverty in a kingdom that thinks her dead. Reek gets a reward for his services in gaining Moat Cailin’s surrender, finally getting his punishment. The Bolton’s control the North, the Arryns are about to collapse, making way for Sansa and Baelish to take power, the Westerlands and Crownlands are in turmoil over the death of Tywin, rendering the Lannister’s a broken faction. No one wins, I like it.","It ended with Arya heading to Braavos, in my opinion",GOT ended?,I was gonna tell my kids they never finished filming GoT.... Kinda like Half life.. but I can't use that excuse anymore..,"Queen Dany just hired Tyrion Lannister? Just met the man who was her blood enemy until a week prior?

Plus, I understand author delays, seeing as I expected to have *Farisa's Crossing* published 7 months ago (exp. date now: Feb. 2021). 

I guess D&D caught wind of the mild shade I was throwing and said, ""Fuck it, you know who's going to win the game of thrones? Nobody. Absolutely fucking nobody gets to win the game of thrones.""

Sansa was their best candidate and they didn't bother making up a good reason for him to give her to them.,"In the books, LF’s gift of Jeyne Poole (who he poses as the lost Arya Stark) was brilliant, as he lost nothing important to him or his ambitions while gaining significant influence with the Boltons.

Littlefinger could then become Warden of the North and Protector of the Vale.,"Because the Vale was absolutely destroyed. That is why. In the books it seems that ASOIAF is about the story of the seven kingdoms not about Starks, Lannisters and Daenerys. Because The Vale was destroyed Baelish became useless. Martin has said that we need 4-5 more seasons. These seasons are not because of the incredibly idiot idea of Daenerys becomes crazy (by the way Meereen plot was only 3 seasons long and many people are complaining that they don't like it very much and they are waiting for Daenerys in Westeros. Can you imagine 5 seasons for ""Daenerys goes crazy"". It would be incredibly boring. Not to mentione stupid). These 5 seasons are one season for Dorne. Surprise there is no need to convert Doran into nothing. One season about The Reach and the Stormlads. One season about Vale and the plans of lord Baelish. One season of Daenerys ... in Essos. They kind of forgot about Volantis. I am almost 100 % sure that Daenerys will liberate the slaves in Volantis at least.

The last you hear of them for a long time is after Samwell let them through a secret passage in the wall. Before that he’s in only a handful of chapters of the longest(?) book in the whole series.

I could pick a bunch of stuff from Seasons 1-4 if I wanted to. Stannis just walking away easily from the Battle of Blackwater when he was on the front lines? Khal Drogo melting gold in 10 seconds to pour it onto Viserys lol. Stannis taking the ENTIRE army beyond the wall somehow (through 1 castle black gate?) to miraculously flank ""the largest army of wildlings"" to save Jon?

Cut to the south. Cersei keeps trying to get updates on what's happening up there, but the ravens don't return. Eventually it becomes clear that the dead march on. She and Euron frantically prepare to defend King's Landing. The dead attack the city, but just when it all seems lost, the survivors from Winterfell (all our favorites, maybe minus a few) join the fray. 

At the end of Episode 5 they win by the thinnest of margins. They stand victorious in the ruins of the city...and Dany straight kills Cersei and her loyalists. She doesn't have to be full on mad queen, but the ice cold murder can still pit Jon/the North against her. Episode 6 can still be about what to do about Dany--can they still let her be queen? Do they depose her? Etc.","Exactly. Like the Battle of Winterfell cuts to black somewhere in the middle and the entire next episode is all getting ready from Cersei’s perspective. She still gets the Golden Company and preps for Dany, Euron’s ready in the water, and then she finally hears the dragons calling out through the clouds. It’s time to fight.

One of the most anticipated scenes in the whole series and it looked absolutely turd,"No, that's just not true. Even lower budget and worse fantasy has more consistency. Suddenly characters were doing things that didn't fall in line with their personalities or arcs. Whole storylines were either abandoned or hand waved off. Its objectively bad tv, expectations before it or not.","After reading the transcript of DnD latest conversation (the one about mums and NFL players), I am pretty sure this was the case.","Saying LSH isn’t a major character is like saying Tywin  or Walder Frey aren’t major characters. A character doesn’t need to appear in a ton of chapters to have a large presence in the story. Sure, Stoneheart doesn’t show up often, but her impact on the story in the Riverlands is massive, especially as it involves other major characters like Brienne, Jaime, and the Freys. And she’s poised to have more time in the limelight in the next two books (Gods willing...)

And aside from that, her reveal in the epilogue of ASoS is fucking vintage ASOIAF. Every bit as much of an unforgettable, series-defining jaw-dropper as the Red Wedding or Ned’s death. The show leaving that out at the end of S4 was massively disappointing because it was such an iconic scene.",Good call. Watch The Boys instead. Quality stuff.,"Why would Cersei's opinion of Littlefinger improve when she finds out he's been harboring the girl who Cersei is convinced murdered her son along with Tyrion?

This whole subplot makes absolutely zero sense due to D&D removing Jeyne Poole from the story, who the **LANNISTERS** sent north to marry Ramsay Bolton, knowing full well she is not actually Arya Stark.  This makes sense in the books because the Lannisters have it in their interests to have the Boltons solidify their claim on Winterfell.  It conversely makes zero sense in the show because why in the fuck would Littlefinger want to help the Boltons with this when HE wants to be warden of the North?","That's the thing, the show didn't even *need* Jeyne Pool. In the books, she's a plot device - she's used to show what happens to girls who aren't protected by their name, to show how terrible Ramsay is, and to motivate Theon to regain a part of his old self. Having Sansa, a main character with a clearly defined character arc, take Jeyne's place meant butchering the story, and all of the characters in her plot line.

Sansa goes from a main character learning about the hypocrisy of the world she admired, and understanding that ""courtesy is a lady's armour"" \[book!Sansa\], to a plot device who cries in a corner and begs Theon to help her \[book Jeyne\], to suddenly being a brilliant schemer who ends up Queen, and doesn't show many (if any) signs of trauma \[very likely endgame book!Sansa\]. The fact that Sansa forgets about courtesy and starts being openly antagonistic to someone as powerful as Dany, I chalk up to 2D being generally disdainful of ""feminine"" skills.

The viewers had already been shown how terrible Ramsay was, and it would have been much less damaging to the story to write another way for Theon to come to his senses. But apparently 2D really enjoyed Ramsay's character, and were very keen on all the graphic torture.",Why did they need it?,Wait...we saw Jeyne Pool in the show? I don’t even remember.,I didnt read the books so I just looked up the character you're talking about and damn that's sad as hell,You’re a bitch,think about all the cool scenes we could've seen with his flashback.,ThE BeSt StOrY!1!!!1!,"To be fair, he had more interesting bits in the earlier seasons.

He just has the most chill life ever. There's barely acting required to read off your text without any emotion.",I think about this but it's because you cannot separate the Stark history and the Jon reveal from it. It's a great piece but does hit harr because of the context of when it's used.,It’s a masterpiece indeed. These soundtracks are so well suited to the entire theme of the respective shows.,Margarine ain’t it?,He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.,Hodor!,">And how is Petyr pimping bad?

Seriously. He wants her to be his Queen. Why would he let Ramsay take the thing he wants the most ?    


>Khal Drogo melting gold in 10 seconds to pour it onto Viserys lol

You really want to wait for hours. The waiting time is skipped, not making gold so easy to melt like a snowflake. 

>Stannis just walking away easily from the Battle of Blackwater when he was on the front lines?

He just boarded a ship and got out of there. In the books he was in the rear, safe and sound to escape once the battle was lost. He boarded a Lyseni ship after the Ghost of Renly turned the tide of the battle. But true in the show he could have been easily killed since he had to get down the wall and head to the boats, at which time the archers can just shower him with arrows.     
     
I too didn't mind the small things but after reading the books, I can't help but wonder why they didn't use the material to make the show even better and realistic.","Those are your last words? *Fuck you?* Come on, dolref, you can do better.","5 killed all passion I had for the show with its awful writing, directing and acting.

All Littlefinger told her was that Sansa escaped Joffrey's wedding and ended up in Winterfell. Littlefinger still controlled the Vale so Cersei's opinion of him changed.,"I think this is a pretty good explanation for their mindset and the damage it did to Sansa’s arc. There priorities were always on shocking violence, not on character arcs or story progression. 

This also reminds me: Losing Bran speaking to Theon at the heart tree is one of the top scenes I wish we’d gotten.","That's a fair point, I agree","Well I don't know about the specifics, but they needed someone to motivate Theon to find his courage and break away from Ramsay. 

This is pure speculation, but I'm guessing having another character that the audience cares about involved in that situation would make that moment feel even more powerful on screen. In order to avoid introducing another character, Sansa probably felt like the obvious choice for that purpose.

Bran told Jojen in the books he heard stories from Old Nan, not from his father so I think Ned just didn't speak about it.",s6 eps3 Bran clearly states his father told him he beat Sir Arthur. Im going off of the tv series. The books could be different. I don't know how that particular un truth was to protect Jon.,"Well, it could be that Ned was willing to lie to protect Jon, and that included lying about the whole thing. 

Now that I think about it, I wouldn't think Ned would have told anyone about defeating Arthur Dayne... it would have probably brought questions about why they fought.",I'll always hate them,Love this 😂😂,Yeah the same jokes over and over are so funny!

Aside from the incompetence, which was already there, the show became ""self aware"" in a way, evidenced by the ridiculous amount of fanservice in the last 2 seasons.

I know a lot of people are in the same boat but I was really using media as an escape from my dull everyday life. But I wasn't just watching shows and playing video games, I was invested in the quality of it, discussing it with people, etc. it was a full time hobby.

If you're doing something like analyzing great literature or other works of art it can be a worthy and rewarding pastime. But most modern stuff is just a garbage cash grab and I feel like a moron for getting so invested in it.

Nowadays I don't bother nearly as much to seek out and discuss entertainment.... I'll watch a show when it's done and people whose tastes seem to align with mine agree it was awesome. I won't buy a game until it's fully patched and expanded and continues to be well-reviewed. It's not that I won't try anything new but if I do I'm also not going to spend a whole lot of time on it before or after... just enjoy it or don't, and stop consuming it if it's not fun anymore. 

You can have way more fun as a tv fan or gamer if you let people sort out what was good or not after the fact, rather than being part of the group discussing the merits of something before or during it.

So many people put so much time, energy, and emotional investment into something that is ultimately done to make money off them.","I'm not sure I attribute the show's failure to pop culture. The culture embraced it because it was good... but the writers, HBO, executive producers and such... they attributed the success to the *wrong factors.* 

It's about apparent that D&D thought ""shocking"" twists and ""unexpected"" turns were why people liked the show... and they were *somewhat* correct - the problem was that it wasn't the twists exactly, it was the story that led to them, set it up so as to be earned, and then led to consequences that the characters had to deal with. It was the *realism* of it all. They could have cut out all the nudity and sex from the first four seasons, and it still would have been an epic story. 

So they learned the wrong lessons, applied those lessons to their writing and production, and missed the mark by a mile.","D&D even suck at being greedy cunts because they believe in outdated ideas from decades ago about what the mainstream likes. that nerdy shit and fantasy just isn't cool. that was true 30 years ago but nerd culture has gone mainstream since, big bang theory, silicon valley, the DC marvel universes, Harry Potter Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones of course.

Bran’s soul is sitting on a throne in the Weirwood Cave that the CoF made for him after he ate the sacrificial Weirwood/Jojen paste. That’s Bran’s body but it’s not him. He’s the Three Eyed Raven. His sigil is a Raven. He’s one of the many-faces of the god of death. Darkness is his cloak and shield. 

The TER is not going to let Sansa keep the north. Jon allegedly (if the final books are ever released) is supposed to be more assertive. I think when the TER goes for the north, this is where Jon will reach his potential as Azor Ahai. Personally I think it’s irrelevant that Jon is either a Stark or Targaryen. When he died those identities died as well.","And what happens when Bran dies and the next king isn’t a Stark or someone who isn’t sympathetic to Northern independence and won’t give up the North without ANOTHER civil war?

People say the North has suffered but that's because of their own stupidity and they are not the only ones.In the 300 years of Targaryen reign,only the death of Brandon and Rickard are the crimes done against North.Lyanna is as much to blame as Rhaegar and Aerys for that.And in the  Wo5K,except Dorne and Vale all other kingdoms took a heavy toll-Riverlands the most. 

And let's be real nobody is going to choose a Greyjoy for a king.","Yeah, given my knowledge of medieval history and my reading of Westerosi history, I think that’s fanciful at best.","True. Holding onto the last shred of hope, I guess that the books will be different. 

From what GRRM said recently though that..

“the series has been extremely faithful compared to 97% of all television and movie adaptations of literary properties.

But it’s not completely faithful. And it can’t be. Otherwise, it would have to run another five seasons.”

*Edited to include some of GRRMs recent comments above. 

It would have been awesome to see Jon raised as some warrior hero.

The whole story is basically about two warring gods (R’hllor and the Great Other) who are apparently about to bring their battle into the human realm. The Great Other thru Bran and R’hllor thru Jon.","Lyanna was a 14 year old girl and Rhaegar was a twenty something year old married prince, but sure, let’s put blame on an innocent CHILD bc a prince couldn’t keep it in his pants.

And in that case why did the Iron Islands “deserve” independence? Also you’re forgetting Ned Stark, Robb Stark, Cat Stark... all murdered bc of Southern rulers.",">«La série a été extrêmement fidèle

WHAT ?!!!!

They have removed half of the intrigue in them, the personality of the characters are in different light years, and 3/4 of the things on which Dumb and Dumbers have based themselves to make their end exist even not in the books","GRR MARTIN reveals that the show “wasn’t faithful” to his preferred ending.

SOURCE: https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/10/game-of-thrones-ending-george-rr-martin-faithful

ALSO GRR MARTIN: “*How will it all end? I hear people asking.   The same ending as the show?  Different?*

*Well… yes.  And no.  And yes.   And no.   And yes.   And no.   And yes.*

*I am working in a very different medium than David and Dan, never forget.*”

Game of Thrones has not been GRR MARTIN’s story for a long while. Probably not since season 4. And no, fuck D&D and their shit end. I’m not going to pin season 8 on anyone else except them & their incompetence. 

If other and more competent writers were given the same ending GRR MARTIN vague outline, you can’t guarantee it will have the same shit ending the arrogant fucks came up with.",Where in the heck did you get the part that GRR MARTIN said that a majority of the show’s shit ending (aka season 8) is actually 90% accurate because THAT IS A LOAD OF SHIT.  Add your source and then name your poison.,"Robert fucked a 14 year old whore in the books.

Dany was 13 when she married Drogo who was like 40.

Iron Islands got independence because Yara provided Dany Fleet and also promised not to pillage the other kingdoms.She asked nicely and showed respect and diplomacy.

Ned died because of the stupid actions he did in KL.And Robb because he couldn't keep in his pants.","> i am **working** in a very different medium...

According to the GRRM interview and article...

“GEORGE RR MARTIN’S The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring will see a much more assertive Jon Snow than in Game of Thrones.

It would certainly be quite something if Aegon took the Iron Throne at the end of A Song of Ice and Fire rather than Bran.

However, Martin has repeatedly affirmed that all the major plot points in Game of Thrones are what he plans for the last two novels in the series.

Speaking with 60 Minutes earlier this year, the author said: “I don’t think [Game of Thrones showrunners] Dan and Dave’s ending is gonna be that different from my ending because of the conversations we did have.

We’re talking here about several days of story conferences taking place in my home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

Martin continued: But there’s no way to get in all the detail, all the minor characters, all the secondary characters.

The series has been extremely faithful compared to 97% of all television and movie adaptations of literary properties.

But it’s not completely faithful. And it can’t be. Otherwise, it would have to run another five seasons.”",See above.,"And you’re missing the whole point of making them that young is they’re given this responsibility but still act like children. But hey, I mean if you wanna defend statutory rape and a grown ass man fucking a teenager (while correctly, I’m assuming, calling Drogo disgusting as well even though Dany grew to love him) that’s on you. You can’t teach someone morals like ‘hey the married twenty year old needs to take ALL the blame for raping a 14 year old girl) and I’m not going to try.

And Jon pledged his armies to Daenerys. They were going down south (and ended up murdered bc Khaleesi had a blowout and burned them all alive).  Wtf more did she want??? Also you only ‘deserve’ independence if you’re nice to the people you want independence from??? That’s.... not how that works? At all? In ANY way????","I think you need to read what he said slower for a full understanding ... and then you’re taking something he said *from earlier this year*, pre-s8 release. What shit.

Frankly, the only thing that’s been officially confirmed (thanks to Isaac, who played Bran) was that Bran becomes King. That’s it.","Did you hear Bran' narration when he revealed Jon' parentage.""He loved her,she loved him"".Jon himself said Rhaegar wasn't a rapist but you do you,sweetie and act like Lyanna was an innocent victim.

And Independence isn't asked nicely but you do have to treat your allies with respect.Sansa showed none.","I was debating whether or not to get into a pissing contest with you about this. Guess I will. There is no need for me to “read what he said slow.” I quite understand the article.

Let me state, I’m not here to change your opinion. We all have an opinion and an asshole. I don’t care if you hate or love Season 8. D&D. GRRM or the story. It’s your right to hate or love anything. Nor am I here to defend the show or sing its accolades. GOT is not my story to tell. They don’t pay me for PR representation. 

I, as a fan of the story, was merely mentioning a recent article I read a few days ago. Anything that is written, it’s interpretation is left up to the reader to form his/her own opinions. Really makes no difference to me what your opinions are. They are your own. I may agree or disagree.

Yes. It was obvious Bran would be king. This whole story has been his backstory. The other characters were distractions.

GOT Promotional Poster has a Crow with Ned Stark

The author of the current article I linked above was released on 11/25/19, did partly reference a 60 Minutes Interview with GRRM which aired 4/13/19 with Anderson Cooper. The show premiered the following day on 4/14/19 and concluded 5/19/19.

So, according to you, because of a few of the referenced statements made by GRRM on the 60 Minutes broadcast which were made the day before GOT Season 8 aired, they are now irrelevant because the statements were made prior to the ending of Season 8? 

Anything an author tells the media is public record regardless if he/she has a change of heart. It’s still relevant.

Sure Jan.","I am using all information that's been given on Lyanna.Because if we go by books,Dany isn't even in Westeros and hasn't burned KL.

“I don’t believe Dan and Dave’s ending will be that different because of the conversations we did have.” GRRM to Anderson Cooper 4/13/19

GRRM comments right there in the 60 Minutes interview one day before the show premiered. 

GRRM is distancing himself from the show now (rightfully so $$$) because of fan reaction. And he wants to keep it that way. He still has books to sell and shows related to GOT due to come out.","The day before the show premiered? Fuck sakes! That don’t mean shit. You meant before 8x01 and before it got worst as the episodes went on? Are you assuming GRR MARTIN saw or knew anything about how shit the season finale was going to turn out? Even the actors didn’t see the shit coming. 

Clarke told Entertainment Weekly her first thoughts were: ""'*What, what, what, WHAT!?' Because it comes out of f***ing nowhere. I’m flabbergasted. Absolutely never saw that coming*.""

I think we all had our clown faces on up until 8x03. And then who can forget 8x05.... fuck, I wish I can forget it. 
I doubt that even GRR MARTIN thought the two arrogant fucks can fuck up the world and characters he created *this* badly. 

In fact, it gives you a better perspective as to why GRR MARTIN decided to separate himself from the two fucks after season 4. Since then, what do you know? It’s been a slow coming nose dive. That’s one heck of a *creative difference* but hey, they sure got their *goddamn zombie polar bear* so I’m sure with that alone, it’s a definite A or A+ in D&D’s book.

Nice try, Jan. But *ah don’t wunt et.*",Qyburn...touches the ground in a sex way?!?!??,I can't wait to tell my onions about this,">*Bran exits carrying Bran.*

So he's acting oblivious to keep all this tension from exploding into open conflict and pissing Daenerys off so much that she just leaves.

For the most part, they had to be Architects, but as we all know, GRRM is a Gardener, and sometimes gardens get overrun with a lot of weeds. Many fans find these the two most boring books. And many storylines did not work on the show or would not have worked on the show, if included.  Examples: 

Dorne, false Aegon, Tyrion meanderings in Essos, Stoneheart, Vale. Also overmuch Reek, Meereen, Braavos, sellsword politics, etc. 

 Many readers liked some of these or  all of these, and sorry if I’ve mentioned one of your favorites. I’ve mentioned one of mine.

I've seen an analysis of writing (not specific to GoT) that differentiated good writing and not-so-good writing as writing ""scenes"" versus writing ""stories""

This is like Hardhome, and Battle of the Bastards, and the Sept of Baelor destruction... those were just 'scenes', but the story was disjointed.  Especially with the last bit, it had no consequences, like huge events in the earlier seasons would, because they came from a *story*.","People give them way too much credit for those early scenes.

Tywin doesn't know Arya is missing. Cersei covered that up and went to Littlefinger to get him to find her. While Tywin clearly believes Arya is lying about something, there are sufficient clues for someone like him to not suspect she's as high born as she is.

For example, when Tywin has Arya test his food for poison (something he wouldn't have a valuable prisoner does), she eats with very poor table manners (would he think Ned Stark and Catelyn Tully's daughter would allow their daughter to act like that?)

Tywin would never suspect Arya was Arya because of Arya doesn't act like a lady. She acts like someone of lower born status who was raised around high borns, like Jeyne Poole, but who is very rough around the edges.

That makes it not worth Tywin's time to figure out who she is.  He's too smart and makes assumptions like she's small for her age because she's been underfed her whole life - thus proving she's not valuable as a hostage.

If it's the former, then yes, defiantly overcoming hardships can make you a stronger person. Though it can also break you and leave you in pieces. 

That being said, I'm not entirely convinced Sansa actually is a 'Strong woman'.  We are constantly told that she is, but her being 'strong' pretty much consists of being a massive bitch to the one person who ensured her survival and jeopardized everything to help her.

Dany actually is a 'Strong woman' (before she got lobotomized in season 7,8) and she definitely is as strong as she at least in part because of the hardships she endured.(As she likes to remind us)  The difference is that the hardships Dany endured didn't strip her of her emotions and her compassion. She fought for the weak and the helpless even though it was detrimental to her war efforts. It seems Sansa only thinks about herself. She isn't 'Strong' she'd just a bitch. That's too bad though, she wasn't like this always. Back when she was with Joffrey and took risks to help the drunk knight. Or point out she saw Joffrey cry when he mocked Tommen for crying. Then she was strong.","The writers don't know how to make a strong woman... so they removed all her empathy and pathos and just made her into a bitch. 

I'm not usually one for pushing for any sort of 'diversity' in any positions, as long as the people in those positions are *qualified* for them... but this was a case where I think having a team of writers, with several women, would have helped write better female characters.","The sentiment was misguided and ill-written. There was a lot of telling and not showing with Sansa's character in the last season. Arya had to tell Jon Sansa was smart and Sansa had to call Tyrion dumb so the audience knew Sansa was smart now. Likewise, Sansa had to convey through words that her character had been affected by all the trauma she had dealt with. Instead of, you know, not skipping an entire character arc in the Vale that would have gracefully shown the change in Sansa.

I don't believe there's anything wrong with that idea. It's a fact that people are shaped by their experiences good and bad and it's very evident in Sansa's character. If you were to try and write her yourself, you'd almost have to pick which Sansa you'd want to write or mimic her traumas and the resulting development of her character. 

It's the classic, ""What if Hitler got into art school?""   question. Who would Sansa be if Ned hadn't gotten his head chopped off, or if Robb and Cat didn't die the way they did, or Rickon? What if she had never met Littlefinger? What if she hadn't married Ramsay? Would she be the same? Probably not. It doesn't make Ramsay's actions right. But it was D&D and I doubt they possess the capability of writing complex character arcs without GRRM holding their hand.","I do think that sometimes negative experiences can teach you valuable lessons, but the idea that you **must** go throught bad shit to be wise forever annoys me.

People can also learn good lessons by following good examples and good leaders, they can learn by love rather than fear, and they can learn in a positive environment. 

If Sansa had been married to a honorable Lord, had children and had a fairytale life, there wouldn't be anyhing keeping her from becoming smart and wise. 

Of course, that probably wouldn't be as exciting as her storyline, but to say she **had** to be imprisoned, sold and raped to become smart... is stupid.",Agree.

Master of Coin is also a job that involves tax collecting in Kings Landing as it's primary means of raising revenue, which in a dilapidated economy like Westeros after the wars more or less means extorting all the merchants. Masters of Coin have a shorter life expectancy than any small council position besides hand, and those that are particularly tactless in collecting taxes risk getting swamped by an angry mob and murdered. It also keeps him out of the Reach and thus at a disadvantage should his vassals rebel. In universe, Tyrion could be betting that if he doesn't get himself killed by an angry mob in Kings Landing, he'll get himself killed by unruly vassals. Of course, none of this is intended by 2D because they're both lazy morons, but the decision to give him those things makes sense from a realpolitik perspective if the aim is to get him killed while refilling the coffers through extreme taxation that you can then repeal and blame on the late lord of Highgarden once he bites the dust.",7 Gods there's more holes in the plot than the movie Holes.,All the smaller nobles and lesser folk got written out.

Besides that yeah he’s very much a warrior who can rally troops and what not. But doesn’t equal a good ruling king.","Here's what he said:
>Ruling is hard. This was maybe my answer to Tolkien, whom, as much as I admire him, I do quibble with. Lord of the Rings had a very medieval philosophy: that if the king was a good man, the land would prosper. We look at real history and it’s not that simple. Tolkien can say that Aragorn became king and reigned for a hundred years, and he was wise and good. But Tolkien doesn’t ask the question: What was Aragorn’s tax policy? Did he maintain a standing army? What did he do in times of flood and famine? And what about all these orcs? By the end of the war, Sauron is gone but all of the orcs aren’t gone – they’re in the mountains. Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic genocide and kill them? Even the little baby orcs, in their little orc cradles?  

>The war that Tolkien wrote about was a war for the fate of civilization and the future of humanity, and that’s become the template. I’m not sure that it’s a good template, though. The Tolkien model led generations of fantasy writers to produce these endless series of dark lords and their evil minions who are all very ugly and wear black clothes. But the vast majority of wars throughout history are not like that.

I think this is mostly a difference in interests and resources. Tolkien read a ton of myths (such as the Kalevala) and the general form of his work reflects that. In myth, especially mythologized epics, things are sort of elevated from reality but still reflect it, sometimes reflecting reality more accurately than if one used realism instead.

Martin draws a lot from popular history and historical fiction, basing the manner of his stories on the often gritty imaginings of those times and their events. Also a lot of pulp stuff. So I think his ""quibbles"" come from being immersed in that perspective.","https://youtu.be/l_MyUGq7pgs

A general that was absent, when others were present. So there is one theory that the others intentionally “misheard” his dying words.

“tôi kratistôi” vs “tôi Kraterôi”

Though even the story of a final statement at all is disputed, and there are other accounts, like Alexander passing his ring to the head of his guard. We will never know.","He tried to set up his son as his successor and set up a general named Perdiccas as regent. Unfortunately Alexander's wishes basically meant nothing to these people since they were power-hungry and out to win the Empire for themselves.

Alexander actually did a lot to keep his empire together, balancing the wants of his newly conquered subjects and the Macedonians who helped him conquer everything. Who knows if he would have been able to keep it together if he hadn't died so young. His main downfall was that he needed to keep conquering and that he fought in battles himself too close to the front lines.

Why bother delaying the throne once again when she could have taking KL easily and got the main goal ? Why delay it once more to help the north with all her forces i ?  Why save jon again after his reveal when his death could align with her goal?","At least for me, it's more that they're setting up her mindset, her psychological geography, to be one of someone who has some serious potential to go mad *if outside circumstances align to push her so*. Things like early and repetitive trauma, a tenuous support structure (she has close friends, but nothing like a community or family to fall back on). I think she gets more attached to people than they to her, because of the lack of family/love she had early on (only had an abusive brother). She becomes very very focused on her goal, sees it as both something she has to fight for but also something she has the right to (not like her brother, but there are shades of it), and I wonder, once she gets closer to that goal, how well she can handle not getting it. She has the capacity to be incredibly vicious towards her enemies (but so have pretty much all the major characters, with the exceptions of Brienne, Sansa, Sam, and Davos), but so far it's been mainly people who, objectively, kinda deserve it. 

But these traits could also make her a great leader, she's empathetic, intelligent, cunning, and has a sense of fair justice, she's capable of making compromise. 

I think there are a couple of scenarios that could play out, both involving the Wildfire caches under Kings Landing and Young Griff. Young Griff might start to win over the masses or be poised to win the Throne, and Dany will see this Johnny-come-lately swooping and and stealing what she fought and suffered for, and go after him a little too hard, accidentally blowing up Kings Landing in the process. Or she takes the city first, accidentally blows it up, and THAT is what shoves her into madness, the guilt and blame of killing so many innocents, and then she just goes HAM on anyone that is left that she can blame for this, like Young Griff or Cersei or Stannis. 

Or she never goes mad, only is the Mad Queen in gossip and tales.","Just her immaturity in leadership in Meereen. She definitely had the dragon. The seeds were planted there, and had they had time to grow they would have made sense in my mind. A lot of it was slow, and it seemed more desperate as her advisors were dying, which amped up in season 8. When she was alone, she tended to go violent. BUT she had developed a good heart and matured a ton in leadership.

Even when the plot goes to hell though, the cinematography, set design, and costuming are amazing.

I consider her leaving the Slaver's bay (and yes it's the slaver's bay since they most definitely took it back once she left with all her force) the final nail in her moral coffin. She left a fucking merc in charge for god's sakes. 

What happens after her arrival is rushed to a point of nonsensical, but I interpret it as her genuinely falling for Jon. Both as a love interest and an object of admiration. He was actually what she pretended to be. But ultimately her obsession/hunger for power takes over. Which is fitting since that was her primary drive anyhow. But yea it was A to B to Z. They should have started to elaborate this stage of her reveal over atleast one season earlier, but the show makers rode that ""good danny"" popularity wagon too long and tried to jump off the last minute.

The books describe them as almost the same being, even when bran isn't warging into the wolf they still communicate and have a really powerful connection. But his wolf gets slaughtered by zombies and he never even flinches over it or sheds a tear. 

He had more freedom than bloodraven too, meera easily could have stayed with him and been useful, there was no reason for bran to become a zombie tree man and extend his life to wait for the next greenseer like bloodraven had to do. 
The writers made this giant transition with no build up or even a real sense of what was actually happening to bran, and when he does become ""the three eyed raven"" its just like all the years of character development and usefulness are washed away for some horribly cheap and rushed ending that makes no sense. The entire 8th season bran just sits around staring into space and dishing out the occasional weird cryptic line with no followup whatsoever.","Yup, Jon's the heir to two noble houses full of fuckbois.

The similarity between Dany's last scene and her flight from Mereen is astounding. The slavers, Yunkai, Mereen, everywhere are rejoicing that Dany is dead since they see her hair burning. They believe the dragon has taken her away to eat her, that she's not coming back & start with their shit. 

A couple of months later, Dany returns as vengeance personified for all the masters. Maybe the slave masters will risk trying to resume slavery a second time or maybe they will remember what happened the last time they thought Daenerys Targaryen was dead. 

I don't know whether we will get an open ending in books or Grrm will confirm one way or another. But myth around Dany's resurrection will forever remain in Essos.

She then decides “Fuck Westeros and it’s people. They’re pretty much all cunts anyway. I’m gonna stay in Essos and keep fighting the good fight and all the Westerosi can keep their backwater shithole continent.” She then laughs as she hears the stories of the whole continent falling into ruin because all the people in charge are idiots and King Bran is too busy warging animals to give a shit.

I had briefly forgotten that most of /r/freefolk was still defending the show against criticism up until S08E03. /r/asoiaf had long since recognized that the show was dead, but even after S08E01 aired, this subreddit would mostly still defend it.

S08E01, for reminders, literally had its first line of dialogue be a ""haha no balls"" joke from Tyrion to Varys. That was the *first* dialogue of the *entire season*. After waiting 2 years between seasons, and wanting to see if maybe Season 7 was just rushed and D&D would do better this time...the first line of dialogue was a balls joke.

6 episodes and they just completely wasted an entire one on the people just ARRIVING? Yikes.","Nah, if they went with the theory where the NK goes to Kings Landing while his army attacks Winterfell, it would have been enough time and would have worked wonderfully. 

Ep 3: Battle of Winterfell. The living take heavy losses but end up winning, not through deus ex Arya, but by killing a few white walkers and actually winning the battle. At the end of the episode, as they burn the dead the next morning, the mood is somber and everyone is wondering where the NK was. It's the one outcome they didn't expect, to win the battle but not the war with it.

Ep. 4: opens with Cersei doing Cersei stuff. Suddenly the bells ring in warning, she goes to the window and sees the NK on Viserion destroying KL. She tries to escape but the Mountain gets taken over by the Others and kills her, Qyburn, and all of team Cersei. Cut back to Winterfell and Bronn arrives, he saw the NK on Viserion heading south and let's everyone know that KL is fucked. Flash back to KL, Euron walks into the ruined and snowy throne room where NK sits the throne. Euron is holding a baby, which he gives to NK. He's been pulling a craster this whole time and the Others are smart enough to ally with such humans. Euron will be allowed to keep the Iron Islands and conquer other island territory (stepstones, summer islands, etc) and once Westeros is conquered his ships will transport the Others to Essos to continue conquering. NK raises the dead, his army is larger than it ever was before and he still has more White Walkers. Back in Winterfell, the crew make battle plans. Bran tells them it had to be this way, he foresaw it and lied to everyone, but the NK has made a fatal mistake.

Ep. 5: Enact battle plans. The two armies meet before Harrenhal. It's epic. Bran wargs into Nymerias pack. The living at losing though. Dance of Dragons ensues. Dany gets injured an Drogon bugs out to protect her. Jon is outmatched and flees, NK pursues. NK catches him over God's Eye, wins, Jon lands with Rhaegal who flies off (or dies of wounds), NK goes for Jon and Dany appears on Drogon and knocks NK off Viserion, then fights Viserion overhead. Jon and NK duel, NK is winning, Jon barely able to backpedal further I the island, eventually getting to a circle of Weirwoods before the NK stabs him in the gut. NK smirks, before Ravens start fucking his face up. Cut to Bran with white eyes. From behind the Weirwoods, children of the forest emerge, chanting, as Weirwood roots rise up and bind the NK. Jon rides unsteadily, grasps Longclaw, and runs it through NK's heart. White Walker explosions and wights dropping ensues. Jon collapses. End episode.

Ep 6: Dany lands next to Jon. She holds him as he dies. The living burn the dead and the mood is somber, much has been lost Dany returns with Jons body. Flash forward 9 months. Turns out Dany got pregnant by Jon, the realm I celebrating the birth of her son. We learn of loose ends being tied up. Euron is still out there but his fleet has scattered, rumors are he's went pirate with the portion he kept. Bran has moved to the Gods Eye full time to be the 3ER. His contributions have resulted in Weirwoods being planted in most courts. Everything seems generally good. In Winterfell, Sansa is settling in as Wardeness of the North. It turns out Arya is missing. Aboard Eurons ship, hes about to get up to some rape. His crewmate is helping hold the girl down. Suddenly, the crewmate stabs Euron in the throat, and removes his own face, it's Arya.

>I get annoyed by people trashing the Loot Train Lannister v Dragon battle and then listing Blackwater as a favorite episode. We can have both better writing and good action. 

Blackwater was a seasons worth of build up, and the best scenes in that episode have nothing to do with fire or battles. The loot train was them saying ""We need a dragon action scene for this episode lets teleport them again"".

Balarion the Black Dread did.

Unlike Elendil who saved his people built  a new king for then (without the need for Dragons) and fought against the Dark lord.

Elendil the tall> Agon the ""conquer""",So he has to be 240lbs to be a fierce warrior? Not very agile a build to be fighting on and off dragon back.

Just Daeron I, Rhaegar or one of the Jaehaerys, he's got that sorta build.","He's not a good casting choice for Aegon, he doesn't have the build to portray the character.

I know you care about your opinion but you shouldnt get so emotional if someone calls you out for being condescending.

You original comment seems pretty serious and when talking about the physique of an actor, using an weight number like ""120 pounds"", it will be seen as its your actual opinion and not an hyperbole.

We are writing words here, not speaking, so its harder to notice rethorical phrases. There is no way that your first comment was ""clearly hyperbolic"".

The first reaction to criticism shouldnt be ""your wrong for attacking me"" but ""hey thats kinda rude but maybe he is right"".","You haven't read a thing I've said, I used Henry because of his build, that's what Aegon needs to look like. Would my ideal casting be Henry? Yes. Are there plenty of other actors cut out for the role who have the right build? Yes.

Because the decline in quality started with them.

to your question about Dany believing she's a god -

It was still salvageable, but it was a train wreck season that directly lead to the brutal death of the show.","It really just goes to show how bad Season 8 was. All my friends enjoyed Season 4's plot, but raised an eyebrow at some of the questionable choices (having Shae genuinely love Tyrion makes the trial make less sense, having Tyrion kill Shae in self defense is weaker, cutting out Jaime's Tysha reveal, etc), and we groaned through Season 5 but still felt the show could be decent, and then Season 6 tipped it over the edge into ""Okay, this show is not going to be good again"". Seasons 7 and 8 were just the icing on the cake of bad, but it had been obvious for a while by that point that the show was broken.

Yet there are still so many people like OP who not only don't seem to care that much about the flaws in Seasons 5 and 6, but considers those seasons to be the peak of the show. It's crazy to me. But that just goes to show how bad Season 8 was. It unites people who had long thought the show was getting bad with people who, for some reason, think Season 6 is the best season of the show. All can agree on how bad Season 8 was.

But yeah, Season 6 really was a train wreck. I think people get tricked by fondly thinking back to their emotions when Hodor died, to the spectacle of Battle of the Bastards, and to the cinematic nature of the sept explosion. And they walk away thinking the season was incredible. But a few individual moments don't make a season good by any means. Season 6 was a disaster which is only elevated by those 3 things, and I think 2 out of 3 of those moments aren't even good. The Battle of the Bastards was great spectacle, but not good writing. It all hinged on us being surprised by Littlefinger showing up at the last second, which people saw coming a mile away, and it relies on Sansa being an absolute idiot, and it was filled with heavy plot armor for Jon. And the sept explosion might have been a great cinematic moment, but it was a huge cop out from the writers to take a situation where a character seemed to have no way out, and instead of writing a clever conclusion to those plot points, just blow it all up, and it was followed by the absolute idiocy of Cersei just being the undisputed queen. So even these moments which people remember making Season 6 good were only good at spectacle, but not being good writing.

And if you actually set those moments aside, the season was just so weak. The absolutely ridiculous Arya in Braavos arc, the completely boring lead up to the Battle of the Bastards (just scattered scenes of talking to random lords and ladies, trying to recruit them), etc. To reiterate, even if those moments in Season 6 were truly incredible, I don't think 3 great moments do enough to counteract a season full of bad in order to call the season great; it would just be a bad season with a few great moments. But on top of that, 2 of the 3 moments which people often think fondly of were not even good moments at all. Just a bad season.",Hodor!,They are jewish they can't eat pork.

 In truth, this scene is clearly a dialogue between D & D and the viewer to justify the forced intrigue that is the sudden madness of Dany. This dialogue is also so meaningless. If you change the subject, you can apply the same argument to any other character.   


After 7 seasons of torture, wars, spectacular death, fighting to death, public beheadings, etc... Coming from all the characters and for reasons sometimes more than doubtful; Without ever questioning mental health of the performers, We must suddenly believe that the death sentence and conquest, has become suddenly something unhealthy and bad, according to the Westerosi value system.

I thought her entire arc was building up to become the best diplomat in order to assist Jon and Dany. After ALL of her arc, she suddenly turns to want the crown instead?  That’s illogical.  She supported Jon wholeheartedly and could’ve helped maintain peace in the north. And tbh...her and Dany had absolutely no bonding outside of that cringe conversation. They would’ve loved each other.","I think if Dany has been ‘ya know what? Fine. Let’s talk about the North.’ And the two of them had a calm collected rational discussion where they come to a compromise like they get independence after a set period of time, independence after the Northmen fight for Daenerys, the Vale and Riverlands aren’t included, independence but their armies still help one another when needed, whatever... they would have gotten along. But Daenerys refused to even talk about it with Sansa, and Sansa was not willing to budge. Her mother and brother died for independence, her father and grandfather and uncle were murdered by southern rulers... she gave up her birthright for Jon to be king when SHE was the oldest trueborn heir (under the presumption Bran & Rickon was missing presumed dead), and then he just gives the North away for a pretty face. 

And exactly like not only does she have the right name, shes the reason the Starks took back Winterfell, she’s shown to be a good ruler, she’s concerned about food for her people, she commands the gates be left open until the last possible second... I legit do not understand why people think the smallfolk will hate and rebel. Because she didn’t play nice to a foreign southern ruler? Because she got them independence without any more bloodshed? Because she’s shown she can be tough (slitting Littlefingers throat) but fair (giving him a trial first)? The Northmen choose their leaders. They choose them three times. First with Robb, then Jon, now Sansa. It’s literally what Missandei said, ‘she’s the queen we choose’. The Northmen choose the Starks.  (Also considering the Starks have ruled for THOUSANDS of years pretty much without a single break, I really doubt all of a sudden they’re gonna go ‘fuck Sansa, we don’t want a stark anymore bc she was mean!’","why would Sansa want to help a Targaryean after everything she suffered at the hands of the South. Physical abuse, psychological turmoil, loss of identity. It's all the same to her at that point. Why would she willingly want to help a Targaryean who has never stepped foot in Westeros and knows nothing about the North subject.

&#x200B;

Jon said it himself ""Northerners don't trust outsiders."" they only bent the knee to King Robert out of tradition and previous Targeryeans out of fear. That fear didn't stop the terror they experienced. 

there's no evidence Sansa wanted the crown before Season 8 finale. All throughout from Season 6 finale to end of the Season 8 she wanted to give the crown to Jon. Once that was not available, she had to take it, with Jon's blessing. 

there's no reason Sansa wanted to bond with Dany.

Add to the likely theory and evidene that Sansa was developing feelings for Jon, there was also jealousy motivating Sansa's personal dislike (in addition to political) dislike of Dany.","A problem I have is the way Daenerys is written in S8 compared to S7. When Jon finally 'bent the knee', her response was ""what about the people who swore allegiance to you?"" followed by ""I hope I deserve it"". That sounds like she hopes she's worthy of their allegiance, which would lead to understanding it wasn't necessarily automatically *hers* just because Jon bent the knee. I think at that point, she would have had more of a mindset that she *had to earn it, or at least be someone worthy of it*. 

Then in the last season, they regressed her to the arrogant self-assured ""It's mine and you owe me"" attitude about her crown. That was a bit jarring. 

I would figure if they had remained consistent with her attitude from season 7, she would have been more than open to having a real productive discussion with Sansa, though I think Jon would have had to be involved in anything regarding the political fate of the North. Sansa was NOT warden of the North, Jon would have been, though we never saw Daenerys appoint him such, we only know she offered it when they first met if he bent the knee. So that leaves Sansa as nothing more than the Lady of Winterfell, who would have been in no position to negotiate with Daenerys on behalf of the North. 

Getting past that, I would figure at that point, neither Jon nor Daenerys knew about his true identity, and they probably would have still been very much in love. Daenerys would probably have in mind to marry Jon, which would take him and keep him south with her, requiring *someone* be Warden of the North. I'd suspect Jon would want Sansa to be, and Daenerys would trust his judgement. 

The whole problem there is anything actually logical ends up defeating the ""dragon lady bad"" narrative, ruining how they wanted to end her. 

Meh.

Shit writing. The whole last season.",">(Also considering the Starks have ruled for THOUSANDS of years pretty much without a single break, I really doubt all of a sudden they’re gonna go ‘fuck Sansa, we don’t want a stark anymore bc she was mean!’

Either we have different definitions of pretty much  without a break or... The Boltons and the east coast of The North rebelled several times over those thousands of years. Two different. Royce Boltons II and Royce Bolton IV burned significant chunks of Winterfell during their rebellions. As far as I can tell, the Starks hadn't actually controlled The North as a whole until the Boltons bend the knee again 700 years before Aegon conquered the continent.

You're also ignoring the recent rebellion. The Boltons took over the north and had more support for the rule than the Starks.

>I think if Dany has been ‘ya know what? Fine. Let’s talk about the North.’ And the two of them had a calm collected rational discussion where they come to a compromise like they get independence after a set period of time, independence after the Northmen fight for Daenerys, the Vale and Riverlands aren’t included, independence but their armies still help one another when needed, whatever... they would have gotten along.

Sansa wasn't the leader of the North. They would only get along if Dany treated Sansa like she had more power than she did?

>But Daenerys refused to even talk about it with Sansa, and Sansa was not willing to budge.

Dany didn't get a chance to reply and Sansa never brought the topic up again.

>Her mother and brother died for independence,

No they didn't. Robb realizes the problem his lords are forcing him into but only goes along with it because that's what they claim to want. Allying themselves with Renly or Stannis would have most likely kept the Iron Born from attacking while they were in the south. They were opposing the throne in general so they couldn't expect any support from the future king. They norther lords actually have to deal with being independent and turn on him the second things start going south.

>her father and grandfather and uncle were murdered by southern rulers...

She was trying to marry one of those southern rulers.

>she gave up her birthright for Jon to be king when SHE was the oldest trueborn heir (under the presumption Bran & Rickon was missing presumed dead),

She didn't give up anything. The northern lords didn't even seem to consider her.

>and then he just gives the North away for a pretty face.

How was Jon or Sansa supposed to maintain their independence? Dany had more than a pretty face if you recall.

>And exactly like not only does she have the right name, shes the reason the Starks took back Winterfell

She's also partially responsible for the northern army being hung out to dry. She didn't tell Jon about the Vale forces because of her personal beef with Littlefinger and him manipulating her.

>she’s shown to be a good ruler,

When? D&D wouldn't even know what a good ruler looked like.

>she’s concerned about food for her people,

Mentioning food doesn't show an actual concern. She does nothing to actually make sure the entirety of The North can eat. She find out that they have a years worth of food in season 7 and her solution is to take food from the other regions and bring it to Winterfell. That's not an actual solution.

Dany and Edmure were in control of the continents bread baskets and she treated them both like shit.

>she commands the gates be left open until the last possible second...

Do you think that was actual her decision? How do you think Dany would have responded if she learned Sansa locked her men outside of the gates?

>I legit do not understand why people think the smallfolk will hate and rebel.

The small folk would probably rebel because they don't actually have any food. That's not really the problem I see people mention though. The lords would be the real problem. Sansa herself talks about how fickle they are in season 7.

> Because she didn’t play nice to a foreign southern ruler?  

Where do you think the food comes from in Westeros? 

> The Northmen choose their leaders. They choose them three times. First with Robb, then Jon, now Sansa. 

Were you paying attention? The northmen choose Robb then betrayed him. They did the same with Jon and started talking about betraying him in season 7. Sansa talks about this in season 7.

She talked about what happened to Robb and then said:

***""Yes, they turned their backs on Jon when it was time to retake Winterfell, then they named him their king, and now they're ready to turn their backs on him again. How far would you trust men like that?***

***They're all bloody wind vanes.""***",True! All of those points are valid! I was just thinking that her values and Davy’s values are aligned. Dany spent years freeing people from tyranny just to want to force the North under her control because...grandpa did it? Sansa of course would be mad that Jon gave the North away but she’d also be willing to negotiate - and Jon on the throne while she helped control the north was a solid negotiation that wasn’t even brought up. She’s understand an opportunistic marriage like Dany/Jon even WITH the relationship between them.  And her telling the secret? That’s so unlike her.  But plot had to move forward I guess.,"This whole plot of it being north vs south needs to be dropped, because it’s so dumb and like many other dumb things it started in season 8. The north was under the rule of a southern leader for centuries in a peaceful relationship with 0 conflicts whatsoever. It wasn’t until the Lannisters starting stirring shit up, and it all amounted to Ned’s head (their beloved leader) on a pike. How does conflict with ONE house suddenly make the entirety of the south enemies/ outsiders / people the north just can’t bend the knee to for “reasons.” This doesn’t even make sense because the Lannisters control the west, while the Tyrells run the south. Is Sansa just ignoring all the people who tried to help her or comfort her? Olenna? Margaery? Even Tyrion.

And to say the North bent the knee to just because of tradition Robert is so wrong it’s laughable. Ned and Robert were raised together and thought of each other as brothers. They fought together to overthrow the mad king who killed Ned’s father and brother, and who’s son allegedly kidnapped and raped his sister. If anything they loved Robert just as much as Ned and definitely didn’t bend the knee simply because of tradition.

In season 1 Ned said the north values strength overall, and that you find your true friends in battle. Did Daenerys not prove herself when she stopped her own conquest to aid the north which did nothing but cost her? She lost a dragon to save their king, and lost her closest advisor. Not to mention they *needed* her, and her dragons, her armies. More so than she needed them. Yet in season 8 D&D decided to make the north xenophobic and ungrateful.

Sansa was totally undermining Jon every step of the way prior to season 8, yet the show tries to paint it as her being a hero. Her and Arya abomination of a conflict was literally about this. And it shows when she kept the armies of the vale a secret for literally no reason, and didn’t bring them out until things looked dire, and she was smiling up until she saw Jon alive. Then in season 8 she tells his secret when he specifically tells her not to, which puts Daenerys advisors against her. She wants Jon and Daenerys gone for “reasons.” That’s not even questioning how idiotic it was to scheme against your only chance to beat Cersei who’s your main enemy. And lastly she votes to send Jon to the wall for killing Daenerys SOMETHING SHE WANTED HIM TO DO, and doesn’t even mention him as the heir to the throne when voting on the new king. And what does she do in the end? She secedes the north and assumes the title of queen in the north.

The real question is why **wouldn’t** Sansa want to help her own ally, who she needed to fight the AOTD, she needed to fight against Cersei, and loved her brother. If she was smart she would’ve schemed to get Jon and Daenerys together, and assume the role of warden of the north in her place.","Especially since in Season 6 they specifically made a point of her saying the other kingdoms were welcome to ask for independence as well like the iron islands did. Daenerys was also ALL about that ""women in charge"" movement. Most people thought that the 7 kingdoms were going to be broken up into independent realms with a council coming together, which would have been a logical progression....but *expectations subverted*


Had they had Sansa and Daenerys actually have a conversation and Sansa tell Daenerys all about what she had suffered and make a case as to why she wants the north to be free, Daenerys would have been open to it. But instead they thought writing two women in power immediately meant cat fight."," I don't think you grasped entirely what the titles means. Warden is simply a supreme military commander of a region, charged with defending it. That's it. So it means that Jon as the Warden of the North commands northern forces during a military conflict. But that's all. He has no keep of his own, no lands, no incomes... Nothing. It's literally spelled out in the books that ""In peace, the title is only an honor."" Now, Sansa is the Lady of Winterfell but not like Catlyn was. Catlyn received that title through marriage to the Lord of Winterfell, and her duties were centralized around running the household. Sansa was born a Stark. She is Lady Stark in the same manner as Maege Mormont was Lady Mormont, meaning that she is the Head of her House. She's not performing Catlyn's role but Ned's, in fact. Which means that Winterfell is hers to with it as she sees fit, and that all of bannermen of House Stark answer to her. And that's actually entire North. Sitting in judgement, taxes, disposal of other keeps, food stores, finances, local disputes, heredity issues of other northern Houses (like Hornwood in the books)... It's all for Sansa to take care of. Jon superseded her when he was the King in the North, as the supreme judge etc., but giving up that title for the Warden of the North, he actually lost all of his prerogatives, save for the military one. On the show it even was Sansa who called their bannermen to Winterfell after the Wall fell. So this idea that ""as nothing more than the Lady of Winterfell, \[Sansa\] would have been in no position to negotiate with Daenerys on behalf of the North"" is the furthest thing from the truth. Abandoning his crown, Jon actually shifted supreme political position in the North from himself to Sansa. Warden is just a military title, long story short.","But would Sansa have really had any power?   She would get marching orders from Jon VIA Raven, who would be getting his marching orders from Dany and her Lannister Hand.  

Marriages/Alliances are just another battleground and one Jon wouldn't have been willing to fight on.  Sansa has her own marriage experiences, Tyrion (she was a political hostage given no choice), Ramsay (a brutal battle if ever there was one).  The marriages she saw in Kings Landing, Joffrey/Margaery, which was a soft but fierce (until it became outright combat) war between House Lannister and House Tyrell.

And after years as a Prisoner of House Lannister, the family she ran to for shelter (Lysa Arryn), tried to kill her.

The idea that Sansa should have thought, Dany and Jon could get married and all would be well, really ignores everything we the reader/viewer and Sansa herself, have seen throughout this story.","Yes on all accounts. ""The North/the Starks/Sansa suffered so much more than anyone else under the South"" has absolutely nothing to do with what we were shown. The North lived in peace under Southern rule until Aerys reign and when he was king every kingdom suffered because he was a paranoid pyromanic. With the Starks he at least had a reason to burn them, while many others (including his own mistress) were punished for imagined crimes. And later on the North and House Stark accepted Bobby because he was Ned's best friend and they suffered much less than, say, Dorne who had to bend the knee to the guy who ordered the rape and murder of their princess and her children or the Iron Island's who had their heir taken as a hostage.

As for Sansa, I am rather certain that **a Northern lord** raped and abused her and that **Southern troops** won back Winterfell for her. So her being unable to trust anybody from the South is bullshit. Not to even mention the fact that a) Dany wasn't from the South and 2) Sansa's father was the one who supported the man that murdered her whole family and even attempted to poison her while she was pregnant. So by Sansa-stan-logic shouldn't Dany be the one to be unwilling to save the North because ""she suffered so much under them""? Oh i forgot, trauma only counts when it concerns Sansa.","Sansa could have cheered on the Lord's in Season 7 when they were egging her on to replace Jon.  He was gone and she had the perfect opportunity to ascend then and there, she chose not too even before she saw Arya.  She feels helpless when she's not on even footing with everyone else and whom can blame her after the last 7 years.

I can understand the North hating the South.  House Lannister ascended on the backs of House Baratheon.   King Joffrey and his Lannister Hand are credited as mastermind the Red Wedding and now a southern Queen and her Lannister Hand, are back to assume control of the North?  If you lost family at the Red Wedding or were a Lannister Hostage in Kings Landing, why would you be in favor of this?

What Sansa learned in the South was that the game never ends.  The Tyrells and The Lannisters had an alliance sealed by marriage.  That didn't stop the Tyrells from plotting to usurp control of the Throne out from under House Lannister.  Sansa saw first hand how Margaery was able to manipulate Joffrey,  she knows Olenna murdered Joffrey at his own wedding (and incidentally had NO issue letting Tyrion and Sansa take the fall for it).

And as for the argument that gratitude should have made Sansa kiss Dany's feet.  Again, other people have saved or helped Sansa in the past, they were not friends.  For all that Tyrion did for her, he still had her held prisoner in Kings Landing, he still worked to keep House Lannister (Tywin, Joffrey and Cersei) in power, this is why Sansa told Jon, though Tyrion was kind to her, they couldn't/shouldn't trust him.   Olenna was going to frame Sansa for regicide even though Sansa was honest and confirmed Joffrey's true nature.  As much as Margaery was surface nice to Sansa, she still stood up at the Purple Wedding and gave a speech about how The War of the Five Kings came to a ""Just"" end.  I don't think that was lost on Sansa.

A Jon/Dany marriage just guarantee's Dany's control of the North, if your goal is Northern Independence, there is nothing to be gained.  Jon wasn't standing up for the North in the end, he was saying and doing whatever Dany wanted.  That's all he would have done had they been married.   The North would have been in the hands of Dany and her Lannister Hand.  Jon would have been clueless in Kings Landing and done nothing for Northern Supremacy.   If Tyrion had an idea that was good for 3 Kingdoms but bad for the North, do you really think Jon would have been able to sway him and Dany from acting on it?","\[ This whole plot of it being north vs south needs to be dropped, because  it’s so dumb and like many other dumb things it started in season 8. \] quote from Powerblue1022

&#x200B;

**This is patently FALSE.** This North vs South conflict started in **Season 1 Episode 1**. Ned and Catelyn have a dialogue at their disappointment King Robert from the South is demanding Ned come down to the Capital. Please see Ned and Catelyn's bed chamber scene.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP5N5UNbPH4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP5N5UNbPH4)

Ned: I'm a Northman. I belong here with you **not down South in the rat's nest they call the Capital.** 

Catelyn: I won't let him take you!

Ned: King takes what he wants. Twice king. 

Catelyn: I'll say listen fat man. You are not taking my husband anywhere! he belongs to me. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

King Robert's inability to handle business and Littlefinger and Lannister scheming of murder of the previous hand forced Ned to come down tot he Capital. Ned obliged to handle business due to oath of the kingdom, to find out the truth. and his inability to outmaneuver the politicians and unwillingness to deny his integrity led to his untimely death. The conflict with Lannisters led to all sorts of the deaths and misery to the Starks.

&#x200B;

And prior to that, several Starks were burned alive in front of the Mad King while Jaime Lannister watched. 

&#x200B;

Littlefinger, Lannister, Targaryeans tortured and killed many Starks. That's the gratitude Starks get for their fealty and integrity.

Then Sansa is tortured at hands of Joeffrey. Jon is called son of a traitior, instead of the honorable Warden of the North. Sansa is manipulated by Littlefinger. Sansa is arranged to be wed by Littlefinger and Boltons who have a contract with Cersie. 

&#x200B;

All this suffering is at the hands of a Southern rule. This conflict has been going for every season.

&#x200B;

Then here, Jon says he can't bend the knee to Dany because Northerns won't accept it after all they suffered

&#x200B;

The point isn't so much as whether Dany would be a good or bad queen, its that keeping the system of Southern rule over the North puts North at tremendous risk. One monarch might be decent but the next one can be crazy and North is at disadvantage. even serving a decent one like King Robert comes with risks. It hurts the Stark family unit. 

&#x200B;

Sansa Stark and Jon Snow reasonably want to get away from that crap. 

&#x200B;

Sansa has no reason to trust Dany prior to her arriving to Winterfell. Dany had never stepped foot in Westeros before, grew up outside of Westeros, is making a claim based on her being the daughter of the Mad King. She is using her dragons as leverage to get Jon to bend the knee, which means she is putting their life at risk to gain political power. 

See 4:05 mark in this video with Jon and Dany in the cave.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJqkneqc2Sw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJqkneqc2Sw)

&#x200B;

Yes, Sansa should be grateful at Dany's willingness to help the North fight the Night King but that doesn't mean she must be excited about more Southern rule or that there are no risks for the North later on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Dany could have helped the North and tried to arrange a partnership (an alliance) instead of her ruling over them. she didn't because she wanted absolute power. she burnt Tarlys because they wouldn't bend the knee instead of just putting them in a prison cell like a sane human being as Tyrion requested. This is Season 7.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXGBZ1s5k9Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXGBZ1s5k9Q)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is all the reason Sansa couldn't trust them. Jon is a military leader and is making the best he can do and bent the knee to save his people. he kept his oath. but he wastn't going to let Dany kill Sansa or hurt the North. once that came clear, Jon stabbed Dany brutally in the chest and left her body on the ground.",">Especially since in Season 6 they specifically made a point of her saying the other kingdoms were welcome to ask for independence as well like the iron islands did.

I don't know how you missed it, but she wasn't being genuine. The Iron Islands were offering something she needed in exchange for their Independence. None of the other kingdoms had anything she desperately needed. The seven kingdoms splitting up isn't a logical conclusion. They weren't better off before the seven kingdoms was created. Instead of having one absolute ruler, you'd have 8. The same plots and drama that caused drama in Kings Landing would still be present in every region on the continent. Westeros was once ruled by dozens of petty kings. The various leaders of the regions consolidating power lead to there being more stability. Aegon just did the same thing on a bigger scale.","I think you're limiting what Warden of the North does. It's not just a military position, it's a political position. Ned Stark executed the King's Laws in the north as a political figure, and had authority to act as executor of those laws. If it were just military, Ned couldn't do anything without orders from above - the King. That's not practical given Winterfell is so far away. So Warden of the North is almost like being King, though he could not make is own laws, only enforce the laws and decrees of the King of the Seven Kingdoms, but he could act on those laws with the authority of the king. 

You would be right about Sansa being Lady of Winterfell, and pretty much the oldest legitimate Stark, but that doesn't necessarily give her power over all of the North, only the Stark lands. Ned Umber and Alys Karstark were the lords of their lands. It wasn't really mentioned who had control of Bolton lands after Roose and Ramsay were offed, though. Assuming that the Starks now rule it may be assuming too much. 

Without being named Warden of the North by a sitting monarch (Roose was named by Joffrey, and would have retained the position under Tommen and Cersei), and Jon was implied to be named by Daenerys should he bend the knee.","I forgot to put this in there. It’s so ironic that she just hates the south all of a sudden when if I remember correctly it was a northern lord who forced her into marriage with his son, a northern lord who raped her, and the majority of the northern houses did not help take back winterfell. In fact they fought AGAINST the Starks. So tell me again why the North just *can’t stand* the thought of being under a southern leader. But apparently since the North has just seceded, it’s okay for the south to not only be under the rule of a northerner but a foreigner? Logic and season 8 just don’t go together.","YOU'RE THE KING'S HAND! YOU'LL DO AS I COMMAND, OR I'LL FIND ME A HAND WHO WILL!","Again, the Lannisters messing shit up does not account for all of the south. Her hate for them is unwarranted. Ned loved Robert as a brother and fought with him in overthrowing Aerys, the same king who killed his brother and father who was the previous warden of the north. And the seven kingdoms lived in peace until the LANNISTERS wanted to climb power. That has nothing to do with the Baratheons now that it’s common knowledge that Roberts children were never really his children. Abominations born of incest. How is Daenerys from the south? The girl literally came across the sea from **Essos** after freeing slaves. Tyrion is a Lannister but Sansa knows he isn’t like the rest and hates his family just as much as everyone else. He could’ve raped her on their wedding night but he chose not to.

Though the Tyrell’s were ambitious they targeted only the Lannisters and were one of the few people who treated her like a person rather than property. What Sansa and every other Stark learned is that you make friends in the most unexpected places. And If I remember correctly Sansa was glad when her engagement with Joffrey was annulled, and he was promised to Margaery. Yes the Tyrells were plotting to take the throne, and even take the north via a marriage through Loras and Sansa. But notice how the Tyrells don’t hurt people along the way? Sansa was actually interested in Loras, not forced to marry him. The last line of your paragraph is bullshit, Tyrion and only Tyrion was punished for Joffrey’s death. Sansa was never even suspected.

Did I say Sansa should be kissing Dany’s feet? No, seriously find the part where I said it. I’ll wait.

Tyrion didn’t hold Sansa prisoner in King’s landing, that was Cersei and Tywin. Tyrion wanted to let her go and felt sorry for her when she was forced to marry him. However he had no power to let her go because as soon as Tywin assumed the role of hand Tyrion lost all power and sway. Olenna was never going to frame Sansa for regicide, she was going to frame TYRION. You literally already mentioned this. Margaery saying the war came to a just end was little more a situation of perspective, and like you mentioned the Tyrell’s were also playing the game. Was she supposed to insult Joffrey right then and there?

But at the same time Sansa gains nothing from northern independence. This means the other kingdoms are free to conquer the north whenever  because it no longer has protection under the crown. Not it’s *really* an us vs them scenario. If Jon assumed the throne with Daenerys this would mean Stark not only being the ruling house in the north, but also being on the throne. They’d be at the same power of the Lannisters in season 1. Not only that but Jon being a Targaryen means he can control dragons just like Daenerys, this gives the north MUCH  more sway in politics and military power in general. She gains way more with Jon on the throne and her being warden of the north, than being queen in the north. That’s not even mentioning how the north’s defenses are basically non existent, they were only able to muster 10k for the battle of winterfell. They’d be crushed in any conflicts. This is not smart.

Now I’d like to ask you a question. Why does Sansa hate **all** of the south because she was mistreated by the Lannisters, when it was a **Northern lord** who forced her into marriage with his bastard son, the bastard so who later became a **Northern lord** who raped her. Not only that but it was the **majority** of the northern houses who actively fought against the Starks when they retook winterfell, and it was **southern** soldiers who helped take back winterfell. Make this make sense. And I’m not even gonna acknowledge Jon doing whatever Dany wanted because like many other characters in season 8 he just stopped thinking, after the NK he served no purpose and his character just revolved around other characters while he did whatever they told him to do. And though season 7 is also shitty, this is SHARP contract from the Jon we saw there who literally called Daenary’s a child and told her to forget the throne for a while and fight for the living. Even in season 8 he defied her when she said not to tell anyone his secret, so tell me again why would he be just a puppet for her to control?",">Sansa could have cheered on the Lord's in Season 7 when they were egging her on to replace Jon. He was gone and she had the **perfect opportunity to ascend** then and there

How did she have the perfect opportunity? Jon wasn't dead. He left to ally himself with the most powerful person on the continent. How do do you think it would have worked out if Jon comes back and Sansa has stolen his position?

>she chose not too even before she saw Arya.

What are you basing this one? [Arya killing her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdpcyovK0ZU&t=144s) was the only reason she gave to Littlefinger when he suggested that she do this.

The script reads like she was planning to take Jon's position until Arya shows up. This bit was right after Arya got there. What was Sansa worried about if she wasn't up to something?

>Sansa gets ticked off watching her sister and Brienne spar in the courtyard, and worries Brienne might be an ally for her sister should Arya turn on Sansa. **“Sansa is not happy about it”** the script reads. Furthermore: **“This disturbs Sansa; the woman she thought was her dedicated protector is actually a time share.”** That’s why Sansa [abruptly, and unkindly](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-6-beyond-the-wall-sansa-brienne), sends Brienne away.

The scripts show that she was trying to play the lords to get them on her side.

>When Arya [accuses Sansa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk-oBUjx0K8) of trying to placate the Northern lords to ensure they are on her side, the script explains: **“Arya is right. She knows it. We know it. Sansa knows it.”**

&#x200B;

>I can understand the North hating the South.

Are you xenophobic?

>House Lannister ascended on the backs of House Baratheon. King Joffrey and his Lannister Hand are credited as mastermind the Red Wedding and now a southern Queen and her Lannister Hand, are back to assume control of the North?

Do you think Sansa is incapable of logic thought? Tyrion isn't his father and Dany isn't Joffrey.

Sansa was the one playing southern games. She could have brought the Knights of the Vale into their fight to retake Winterfell but doesn't due to a grudge. Littlefinger was still pulling her string at this point. He goes out of his way to point out that their army is loyal to her ""half-brother"" instead of her. She lies to Jon about she found out about the Blackfish retaking Riverun. She sen Brienne on a silly mission to Riverlands to stop her from telling Jon about the meeting she had with Littlefinger. She's clearly manipulating Brienne in the scene where she's questioned [about lying to Jon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-ziN6id30U). She shit talked people who tried or were trying to help them. While Jon's trying to take her home back like she pushed him to, she's hiding that she has and army waiting to help them. During this time, she's shit talking the people that tried to kill her abusive husband and his hand. She's also [mockingly reefers to Lyanna Mormont and her](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvxfeZzYASE) support. These people are putting their lives on the line to help take her home back and she's shit talking them and refusing to offer any support.

She tries to take Jon's position in season 7. She then tries to start a coupe in season 8 by using information that her brother wanted kept secret against their queen.",The Lannisters send their regards.,">Dany could have helped the North and tried to arrange a partnership (an alliance) instead of her ruling over them.

She was probably planning to marry Jon and make him king. He had also bent the knee at that point.

>she didn't because she wanted absolute power.

And Sansa didn't want Dany to rule over them because she wanted her or Jon to have absolute power over half of the continent. 

>she burnt Tarlys because they wouldn't bend the knee instead of just putting them in a prison cell like a sane human being as Tyrion requested. This is Season 7.

The standard punishment for treason and refusing to respect the authority of a regions lord or king is execution. Westeros doesn't really do long prison sentences. You either get a short stint for a minor crime, whipped, maimed, exiled, or executed. Do you think Jon would have put the heads of house Bolton, Karstark, or Umber if they survived the battle of the bastards? He said what the punishment for those crimes was in the scene where Sansa is undermining him to push for punishing children for the crimes of their parents. What did Sansa do to Ramsey again?","What you're talking about - executions, enforcing law etc. - were Ned's prerogatives as Lord of Winterfell, not Warden of the North. That really didn't matter much when one person was holding both titles, but later they were split between Jon and Sansa. And Sansa is the one who holds the political position you mention. Sure, if Jon remained the Warden after the wars, I suppose he would've been respected well enough but he wouldn't have held any political power de iure. Being named Warden of the East gave Jaime no judicial authority over the Vale. Robert also stated that all Eyrie incomes would go to Sweetrobin. As Martin said: ""Wardens are supposed to defend their regions against invaders. In theory, at least, they are each the supreme general for their region and therefore preventing any disunity of command."" If there was anything more to it, Ned wouldn't have argued that it's only an honorary title during peace.

What I meant by Sansa having power over entire North is that all northern lords are sworn to her as bannermen of House Stark. She can call for their troops, collect taxes, pass judgement over them, all of that. Yes, you have Alys ruling Karhold and so on but Sansa is her liege (or was until Alys' death). That's how feudalism works, you have lesser lords sworn to higher lords. And then higher lords sworn to the king. As Lady of Winterfell, with all of the North behind her, Sansa was actually second only to the monarch. I do not assume that Bolton lands are directly ruled by House Stark now, I assume they were given by House Stark to someone who bent the knee to House Stark. That's the thing, as the Head of House Stark, Sansa can administrate northern lands. That's what I meant.","Yup, Sansa and Jon won their ancestral home back with foreign soldiers and ""violent savages"" (the wildlings, anyone?) despite the fact that the majority of Northern nobility didn't even support their war and fought against them. Weird how they get celebrated for the very same thing Dany gets villainized for.","it wasn't Northern lord who forced the marriage, it was Littlefinger who pressured Sansa to do it (although he claims he wouldn't force her, but he kept pressuring using the logic of avenging her family's death, which was propelled by Littlefinger, a Southerner. Roose Bolton didn't have any leverage until Sansa agreed with Littlefinger's plan.",">Tyrion didn’t hold Sansa prisoner in King’s landing, that was Cersei and Tywin. Tyrion wanted to let her go and felt sorry for her when she was forced to marry him. However he had no power to let her go because as soon as Tywin assumed the role of hand Tyrion lost all power and sway.

What about during Season 2?  He was running things then.  He worked to keep his family in power (he himself acknowledged in Season 8, he fought against the Starks), he was irate when Sansa was taken by the mob because he was worried about what would happen to Jamie as a result.

GRRM himself confirmed the poison was on Sansa (which Olenna knew) because she was to take the fall if the court didn't buy that Joffrey just happened to choke on his pie.  From the Author himself.

&#x200B;

>The last line of your paragraph is bullshit, Tyrion and only Tyrion was punished for Joffrey’s death. Sansa was never even suspected.

Tywin, Cersei and Jamie suspected Sansa of the regicide.  It's the entire reason she was a fugitive from the Iron Throne.

It's why Littlefinger married her to Ramsay (at the time heir to the Warden of the North), so that it would once again push the North into rebellion against the Iron Throne.

What Sansa thinks she will gain, if the North isn't beneath the heel of the Iron Throne, is freedom from he intrigues of Kings Landing (whether that's true or not, time will tell).  The Iron Throne gave The Lannisters the power to elevate House Bolton to Wardens of the North.  The Iron Throne gave The Lannisters the power to forcibly marry Sansa to Tyrion.  The Iron Throne gave The Lannisters the power to elevate House Frey to the top of the Riverlands totem after they hosted the Red Wedding.   In Sansa's shoes, I would want to withdraw from the Seven Kingdoms too.

As for why Sansa hates ALL of the South, she doesn't hate the Vale but everyone else? Pretty much yeah.  Was there a courtier in Kings Landing that didn't mock her or stand by while she was beaten and stripped in the throne room?  The Tyrells were kind to her when they had something to gain, they were indifferent to her fate when they had nothing to gain.  THAT is what Sansa learned.  There are no real allies or real friendships, there are common interest.  Sansa was happy to work with Dany to defeat Cersei but that was where any rapport ended once Dany was clear an independent North would not happen.

As for why Sansa didn't have faith in Jon when it came to Dany.  He gave away the ENTIRE Kingdom, for starters.  When Sansa had one good idea, to let the soldiers rest before throwing them into another war, because Dany was feeling insecure, Jon puffed up like the Hulk and all but said ""Shut up Sansa.""  We the audience saw Jon was still going ""Yes, My Queen"" after strolling through the ashes of Dany's massacre of Kings Landing.  Tyrion had to remind Jon that Sansa's days we're numbered before he proceeded to have a semblance of backbone.  And I understood why she did the things she did.

Some think Sansa should have been ""Ra Rah, Sis, Boom Bah"" for Dany and Jon, I felt that would have been out of character.  This is in no way mean't to convince you of anything.  Just how I see it.  You disagree and everything is still everything.",I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter which Lannister puts the baby in you. Maybe I&#39;ll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.,"It was Littlefinger who is from the South who arranged the marriage between Ramsey Bolton and Sansa Stark, for political reasons. the Northern Lord was beholden to a Southern king and backstabbed the King in the North who they had pledged fealty. That Northern lord beholden to King Tommen abused Sansa all day long and the North suffered for it.",The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me.,"&#x200B;

> As Martin said: ""Wardens are supposed to defend their regions against invaders. In theory, at least, they are each the supreme general for their region and therefore preventing any disunity of command. ""

I think the problem here is that you're interpreting this statement as all-encompassing - that this is the limit of the definition and role of a ""Warden of *Region*"". You're interpreting the statement that it is a military leadership position as indicative that it is *only* a military leadership position. 

I don't think that's the dynamic of a Warden. Jon, as King of/in the North bends the knee, but then is reduced to basically only a military leader breaks the very structure of feudalism, that is, unless he is also recognized as Lord of Winterfell. I'd guess since the Northern lords named him King, they'd probably be on board with him essentially being Lord of Winterfell. If, upon Jon's bending the knee, the Lord/Lady of Winterfell title went to Sansa, his bending of the knee becomes absolutely meaningless, because Sansa could just simply say ""nope, the North is not sworn to Daenerys of House Targaryen"". 

Now, the show leaves a lot out. As mentioned, we never see Jon named Warden of the North by Daenerys, so that's an assumption. We see neither Jon nor Sansa named/recognized as Lord or Lady of Winterfell, although Sansa is called that in the previous season by Littlefinger. So we can assume she was Lady of Winterfell because Jon was in a position higher than she. But what would have happened if, say, Ned Stark was to rebel and be named King in the North? Would Robb have then become Lord of Winterfell, or would Ned still be Lord of Winterfell? It's not really made clear by the show, and I'm not sure it is in the books.","Maester Ok_now_huh, send ravens to all the Northern Houses: Roose Bolton is dead, poisoned by our enemies.",I have never been nothing. I am the blood of the dragon.,"I think it’s easy to hate on Sansa because of some horrible writing in the later seasons. I was stating that a diplomatic marriage would make sense, and her being warden of the north would make sense (the best of both worlds to many people).  I think your points are great, even if you disagree on the Dany/Jon support that Id imagine.

A lot of people think Sansa hates Jon but she loves and respects him up until he endangers her home. Her wants in the show are: her home, her family, safety. When she does something the audience hates her for, it’s usually because something of hers is in danger. She tells Tyrion the secret because of her home and family in danger. When Jon doesn’t listen to her make plans because Littlefinger was involved, she goes behind his back to secure the Knights of the Vale in order to save her family and home. She doesn’t want Jon going south because Stark men never come back - so I agree with everyone that she wouldn’t like Dany, I just think the power marriage would make more sense than Bran on the throne. Easier to write etc.

Another note is that Sansa was a literal child being tortured, imprisoned, and eventually raped. She grew up a prisoner at court. So not only would she despise court but everyone associated with it.  So yes, a child WOULD hate an entire country because of her imprisonment.  I just think there would be fluid writing on her eventually moving past that with Dany on the throne.",">  He gave away the ENTIRE Kingdom, for starters. 

Why do people talk about him giving away the kingdom like he had a choice? What the fuck was he supposed to do? What would you have done if you were in Torrhen Stark's position when Aegon invaded? Get a bunch of your people killed over your pride?",The Lannisters send their regards.,Yes daddy.,"That quote was from ""So Spake Martin"", an answer to the question that was rather general: ""Also, what exactly does the tittle 'warden of the (Blank)' mean. In book one, Robert or Ned say something along the liens of it being honorary except in a time of war. But, so far in the series, we have seen little significance in regards to the title. Do the houses who are wardens have some control over the great houses who are not wardens? IS that why the riverlords seem to simply follow the northern lead?"" There was nothing in the question about the military aspect specifically, only what the title means, in general. And Martin answered that the Warden is a military commander. That's his definition. If there's more to it, why not add it? And, again, as the Warden of the East Jaime had no actual power over the Vale. 

I agree that it sort of ""breaks they very structure of feudalism"" for Jon to be the King in the North without being the Lord of Winterfell. Or the lord of something else at the very least. He was a king without his own seat, having no keep or lands to pass on to his heir. He was practically crashing at Sansa's. More than that, all northerner bannermen are sworn to both House Stark and the King in the North, which means that Jon, as the King in the North, and Sansa, as the Head of House Stark, commanded the very same people. Well, the very same people plus Sansa, in Jon's case, as his title as a king superseded hers as a lady. Still, they administrated the very same lands, had the very same bannermen... And had a right to call for the same troops. Jon's only average was his title. Looking at it realistically, there probably would've been a civil war between Jon's and Sansa's heirs in the future had things stayed that way (seriously, one of them would need to produce no children, and then name the other's as their own heir to avoid a power struggle).

The title of the Lady of Winterfell did not went to Sansa when Jon bent the knee, she assumed it after the Battle of the Bastards. She was called the Lady of Winterfell by Jon at the end of season 6, then again by a Winterfell guard in season 7, she called herself that in her conversation with Brienne... That's on top of my head, all before bending the knee. Furthermore, the lords would actually have a pretty good reason not to recognize Jon as the Lord of Winterfell: he was a bastard and at least one of his true-born siblings were still alive. The title of the Lord of Winterfell is hereditary. Accepting Jon in Sansa's stead would set a precedence for a bastard child to inherit before true-born children, and that basically fucks-up the very base of an inheritance system in their world (as well as Jon's entire characterization... which was later fucked-up anyway... eh). It also means that the lords would be undermining their own positions as legitimate heirs of their predecessors, and create a very risky situation for their legitimate children, who now would be in danger of being disinherited by their base-born siblings. That's a perfect way to ensure family struggles for generation and general instability. We need to look no further than Blackfyre Rebellions to see that. Basically, the politics on the show were completely messed-up in later seasons. For all that to work you'd need to assume that a) the title of the King of the North was granted by proclamation and therefore was not a hereditary one, keeping the laws of inheritance in tact b) Jon's bending the knee was sort of his ""last will"" as the king, to be headed even after he lost his position (like Ned should've become Protector of the Realm, an order of king Robert to be headed after his death). Reaching, not gonna argue about it, but trying to figure out in-universe answers here is a nightmare. We can only imagine that if the next book comes ut, it will set quite a different situation.

Had Ned rebelled, he would've been both the King in the North and the Lord of Winterfell. Just like Robb was both (Bran was only the acting lord during Robb's absence at Winterfell) That's a normal situation: separating these titles is not. It's actually stupid but that's what the show went with, so here we are. Things make no sense in GoT. Shocking, right?",">Another note is that Sansa was a literal child being tortured, imprisoned, and eventually raped. She grew up a prisoner at court. So not only would she despise court but everyone associated with it. So yes, a child WOULD hate an entire country because of her imprisonment. I just think there would be fluid writing on her eventually moving past that with Dany on the throne.

What I don't think I make clear in my posts regarding Sansa is (I don't necessarily AGREE with her) it's more I understand where the character is coming from.  I don't think her feelings come from an entirely rational place but I can still see why the character has issues.

After everything that happened in Winterfell, being subjugated again, within it's walls probably doesn't sit well with her either.

I thought Sansa told Tyrion as a kind of Hail Mary.  She wanted Jon pushing for Northern Independence and she saw he was never going to be on her side.  At that point I think she felt she had lost and Dany had won, and telling the secret was about hurting Dany politically (if it could cause damage) and personally.

I agree with others that Sansa does have a self-centered view of the world but I think her experiences differ from the other remaining Starks in that amidst their horror they also saw the good in people.  Arya formed genuine friendships with Hot Pie and Gendry.  Jon formed genuine friendships with Pyp, Grenn, Edd and Sam.  Bran with Meera and her Brother.   While Sansa and She were close, it was a circumstantial closeness.  Neither would truly sacrifice for the other.   After escaping that viper pit, she runs to family (Lysa) and said family tries to murder her.

I think Sansa was closed off in ways a lot of other characters were not.  After everything that happened Empowerment and safety (as she perceives it) was much more important then Love and friendship.

I'm not sure she would have moved passed things had Dany gotten everything she wanted.   I do believe Sansa holds grudges.  She wouldn't have staged an out and out rebellion but I do think she would have deeply hated Dany henceforth and forevermore.  Especially when she learned the Iron Born got independence.  I also think she would have seethed with resentment towards Jon.   I think Jon genuinely loves Sansa and enjoys when they get along (he seems to be having a genuinely good time with her at the feast in 8x04 and is also visibly touched that she made him a cloak in 6x05).

I liked Sansa and understood why she was the way she was but in some ways it's a shame.  Had she been groomed in a different Court (ruled by Dany or someone who was inhumane, like the Lannisters) she probably could have been a real sweet heart.","The Starks and Tyrion. I still can't believe Dany didn't execute Tyrion's ass right then and there when he threw his hand of the queen pin down.

It’s funny how no one ever uses the ‘They’re just friends!’ Argument with Arya and Gendry or Jonerys.

They are clearly set up from the moment they meet.

Their last scene in ADWD involves Jaime ""scrambling"" to his feet to greet his ""lady"".  It's not a bromance.

What we got on the show was a pale, vague and then melodramatised abbreviation of their book relationship, clearly reluctantly and arguably somewhat spitefully written into the show, probably because it \*is\* book canon, and showrunners thought they should give that some acknowledgment before returning to the Twincest that GRRM broke up in AFFC.","Funnily enough, 99% of the complaints I've seen about Jaime & Brienne's relationship have been ""they're deeply in love and are obviously gonna end up together, dudelsack and didgeridoo fucked it up by having Jaime not completely abandon his feelings for Cersei.""",May their joy turn to ashes in their mouths.,Yeah uh... you came to the wrong sub for that kind of sentiment lol.,r/lostredditors,We accept what they did.

2) Drain it out, spilling a dollar while swallowing a cent, until it's zombie's tits.

4) Circlejerk in Ayn Rand about toxic fanbase, parasitic employees, etc.

5) Repeat.

>I do wonder whether 804 was really rushed though.  Not just everything that happened in story (it is at least 2 episodes stuffed into 1), but the writing and perhaps the  filming too...

It seems like all of the season was rushed. I think they spent way too long doing the completely underwhelming battle at the start of filming and never caught up.","And the actors/actresses truly loved the show, regardless of their feelings for the writing. To become a character is to take on their emotion, and I cannot imagine how they felt after D&D selfishly wrapped up the show worse than I wrap up presents.

I think about Pod singing Jenny of Oldstones, (thank god for this episode as it at least had some great moments) and how it flashed to each character, how every plot led back to winterfell. The characters and the place itself had seen so much. But the actors... they spent eight years of their lives as these people in this world, and I doubt it is a stretch to say that when some of them think of Winterfell, they miss it like a home you left after living there for so long.

Think I’m rambling and pretty off topic, but that’s been on my mind a lot recently. I think “if season 8 actually existed on the GoT universe, then season 9 would be announced next year where Bran wakes up from the vision of the only “happy” outcome possible that was season 8. And then the show not only becomes amazing again, but a devastating red wedding part deux.”

Anyway. I am so thankful to each and every one of the cast members on that show. Despite how they were fucked over, they gave us some of the best television we will ever see. Having to say goodbye to those characters must have been 100x harder for them as it was for us.",Suspension of disbelief is the most accurate expression for s8 so far. Three words have more sense than 8 hours of tv,But SURELY they have a continuity person to keep track of things like this,"The Night King forgetting that winter is a season and not just like, a cloud.","What do you mean ""Gendry forgetting his name?""",Came here to say this. 4 negatives in the title and only one period. Hard to follow.,"I won't not use no double negatives. 

\-Bart Simpson",Unwatchable,Bobby B has the best lines.,"Water battles. I'm not being pedantic, I now genuinely want to see the whole cast in a water balloon fight set to Walking on Sunshine.","You are SO right. Jaime and Brienne was an open goal. One conversation, one look, one touch would have done it believably, they didn't need to do any of the hur-hur-you're-a-virgin stuff. They were obviously attracted to each other and had a rich backstory that clearly pointed to romantic feelings between them.   


What they did instead was work backwards from the premise that Jaime was going back to Cersei and that he was a badman. To establish *that* super fast, they couldn't have him declare that he had feelings for someone as lovely and honourable as Brienne, he had to boink her in the most bastard way possible, with virgin-shaming, a drinking game and dick-measuring with Tormund. He wasn't even allowed to remember that the only woman he'd ever slept with was Cersei, which would have been a kind and reassuring thing to say to Brienne instead of ""I've never slept with a knight before"" ... well, duh, Jaime.  


The sad thing is that a man being torn between the love of two women who represent different parts of him would have been a really interesting story and a realistic conclusion to Jaime's arc, even if he made the wrong choice. It would have humanised him and we would have identified with and felt his pain. Instead, it was ""what redemption arc? didn't happen EVARRR"".","Considering the bear pit was a HUGE moment between them and him or her referencing it during their sex scene was something that fans of their relationship were looking forward to since it happened and then we don’t get him looking or touching or kissing the scars, they ‘forgot’ to put them on period. 
So yes. People are still upset.","Not upset as in crying over it but damn dude when he saved her from the bear it was kind of a big deal. They could have slapped some scar makeup on there and called it a day for continuity purposes but not one person took the time. That’s our big gripe with the entire season, right? Not enough care was put into anything.

*Editing to say the actors and everyone obviously did a great job but you know what I mean. The whole season was a rushed mess.","Every show has a union script supervisor on it, it’s a completely standard crew position.

Not only that but wardrobe and make up departments take their own continuity photos... this is even common on student film sets.

My theory is the departments were so pissed at the quality of the writing after grinding on that show for so long that they just simply stopped caring.",">The last season of GOT was really rushed

Even though it took 2 years to make it.","Yes ofc, I did mention in another thread. how do HBO bring back fans to new prequel? 
Sizable fandom has left this for good permanently after season 8.
They will struggle to bring back viewers. some may return but not what it was earlier",That’s the best explanation. One possible future where a few things go wrong.  They are fixed in later attempts...,"It's always been like this to some degree, but the reaction has always been the same as well. Superhero franchises were a joke in the mainstream until someone finally cared enough to make a good Batman movie, then Iron-man, then TDK and the rest just snowballed. 

So much great content is just pissed away by little fuckboi Hollywood cokeheads like D&D. We should skin these mfers alive for trying to take us back to those dark times, when we couldn't trust anyone to treat our beloved franchises seriously.","""If it's not owned by the Walt Disney Corporation, it's not canon"" is also not how canon works.


You have Finn and Rey's comedy hour, I'll stick to Jacen and Mara Jade :)","Aye Bobby B, we all want",True though,R u a bot? I can't imagine a person being this fucking anal retentive that they actually had to point out that there was not actually an entire fucking Starbucks scene in GOT,You are a man of several words Bobby B. I salute you.,And then some,"Literally every romantic trope was used with these two. Enemies to friends to lovers, he saves her twice, she helps him become a better man, he stares longingly at her island, the two emotional goodbyes, THE AUTHOR LITERALLY WRITING THAT SHE LOVES HIM IN THE LAST EPISODE HE WROTE, their longing looks at Riverrun, their looks at the Dragon pit... 
and that’s not counting the mountains of evidence in the books.","I think there are a couple of reasons why some people don't see it. The lead one is probably that lots of readers simply don't like romance and skip over all the subtext (even thought the JB 'subtext' isn't really very subtle...) so they don't pick up on it until the characters are actively kissing or shagging.  

Other people simply have a hard time dealing with the idea of romance with an ugly woman - it is unusual on television.  I have no doubt if Brienne looked like Sansa,  in the books or show, people would be all over the romance, but because she's large and unusual they can't see it or feel threatened or disconcerted by it.  I fear this latter reason played pretty heavily into DnD's thinking (even though Gwen is far from even plain). 

I did, however, read a really good post from a doubter who explained that he just can't see JB as a romance because it was so impossible - they are both too damaged and have their oaths to prioritise and keep, so he couldn't see either of them characterising their relationship as a romance or even thinking along those lines.  I am not quite doing justice to the argument, but it was a long way from just dismissing it as a bromance.  I haven't seen it made elsewhere but others may think similarly.","Literally the chapter right after Brienne freely offers to die for him and only stops because an innocent boys life was at stake, the chapter were Cersei goes ‘if he dies he dies, at least we’ll go together’. We’re supposed to look at those two instances as ‘okay we see which one really loves him and which one is just using him’.

Twincest and JB is GRRM fucking around with the idea of soulmates. A stunning classically beautiful queen, a handsome knight, oh and they’re twins too! Obvious soulmates in any other fantasy. But here they have nothing in common, they’re nothing alike, she abuses him, she cheats on him... And then there’s this big ugly she-knight who, in the typical rules of fantasy, has NO business being a love interest to ANYONE much less a handsome golden haired shining knight, but they’re the real soulmates of the story, they’re the ones that are most alike, Jaime even mentions something like ‘see, we know eachother too well’ after they finish each other’s sentences, he laughs with her and teases her, they help eachother grow, when Brienne is in danger he always succeeds in saving and protecting her, when Cersei is in danger (from Robert’s abuse or from the High Sparrow) he always fails in saving and protecting her (even the show has this aspect be true even if it was probably unintentional), they know what the other is thinking without saying anything...",I don’t think anyone expected him to completely give up his feelings for Cersei.  The main problem is that in 804-805 he completely forgot about his feelings for Brienne.  And his origin story.  And that he had only slept with one woman his whole life out of a sense of honour and that sleeping with another should be bloody significant. And the previous 6 years of character development.  And his book self.  And that Kings Landing is weeks away from Winterfell.,"Well making the same ""Season 8 bad"" post over and over again is just as stale, and doesn't really do anything anyway.
It might be an unpopular opinion based on peoples downvote, but it is seriously tedious to see basically the same post over and over again..

Suspension of Disbelief doesn't justify continuity errors or inconsistency.

When I watch this show, I'm accepting that dragons and ice zombies and magic exist within the confines of this fictional world. 

But they immediately provided us with a set of rules for how these things actually *work* within this fictional world. 

When they start breaking their own rules for no good reason, suspension of disbelief stops being an excuse. And when they start pulling new rules out of their ass, suspension of disbelief can still hold, but it's weaker because it just feels random or forced, instead of being an organic part of the setting.

The most important thing is maintaining a sense of continuity and consistency. If you can't manage that, then you don't even have a story.

Usually the pitch/idea that writers have that got them the deal doesn't extend past 3 season, thats usually as far ahead as they think until they get a deal. after that they're now coming up with fresh/new stuff and its often not as good, has a different feel than what they started with or has at least a few episodes sometimes a full season of treading water while they try and figure out where they're going to go with the series as a whole.

don't get me wrong there are some series that I could easily sit down and watch 10 seasons worth because I love it, but in the majority of shows viewership starts falling off by season 3 because thats usually the time where people start deciding, is this a a series I'm going to continue watching until its done? or a new shiny series shows up and they lose interest. 

its also the time when some of the production will start trailing off, writers might get another series deal because of the fame from the first so they jump ship, or actors are getting sick of doing the same series for the past 3 years and are looking for a change, or don't want to get type-cast/locked into the series forever, directors contracts start running out and they want more money so they get replaced, etc.

I usually think of seasons 1, 3, 7, and 12 as being the rough spots, its hard to get started, by 3 the first ideas have run out, by 7 people start getting bored without a semi-major shake-up, by 12 usually you're starting to try and appeal to an entirely new generation of watchers, your actors have aged noticeably and you're also due for your next major shake-up/plot change.",Has the Valve Effect hit them already?,The Valve model.,"That’s because the majority of people can’t pay attention to anything without checking their phones every minute.

We can argue about alot of things about Jaimes motivations but the hunger for power was something Jaime never had, partially because he always had power as Tywins heir. He sat on the throne because of two reasons.

1) curiosity, he probably thought fuck it, might as well sit on the damn thing, see what all the fuss is about. 

2) pride and apathy , mostly he already knew that because he was Tywins son and by looking at his fathers bannermen's reaction that he would be seen as a villain, so he wanted to fuck with how people saw him. He is arrogant and prideful and wanted to keep what little dignity he had left as a traitor. He wanted to go out not as a coward but defiant, so he sat on the throne. As if saying that he did nothing wrong. He was there because it was taboo to sit on the throne if you are not actually the king, and Jaime could only see hipocrisy and cinicism in taboos,  rules and knighthood by that time.

 Not because he actually wanted to be king...","My mistake, it was the opposite. He smashed Alton's head with his shackles, then he strangled the guard.

Netflix brings in filmmakers with high levels of skill and impressive resumes, and not always well-known ones that you might say are only hired for the sake of publicity, and for some reason, their output on Netflix most often turns out really mediocre. They brought in Fukanaga to make Maniac and it was initially interesting but then turned meh. They brought in Duncan Jones and he made Mute - again, meh. Dan Gilroy: Velvet Buzzsaw, meh. The Coen Bros: Buster Scruggs, which wasn't bad but wasn't anywhere near their best work. I know it's all subjective but the critical and audience reception is pretty much in line with what I'm saying. 

What I wonder is, what is it about the netflix production process that takes all this raw talent and turns it into middling output? Why, with such a seemingly open prospect in front of them rather than the confined process of creating a film for theater screenings, is the final product just OK?","I know what you mean...

It makes me feel gatekeepy to think this, but all those "" casual"" fans tend to ruin good tv shows.

A show like GoT appears and appeals to a niche group of viewers.  The premiere had incest, attempted child-murder, scary ice people, a lot of morally grey characters and not a single backflip, triple kill or double wielding sword master..

As a series gets popular it starts to pick up casual fans who just want to talk about the latest twist at the water cooler the next day.  They don't need deep world building or complicated plots. ...  They need an episode that can be summarized somewhere on the corner of the cover of PEOPLE magazine.  They don't care about the connection between the Lannisters and the Freys and they probably don't even know who the Boltons are!  They just care that ""OMG the red wedding was soooo surprising and sad!""

Unfortunately, the ""hard-core"" fans (fans of the source material, or just fans who are deeply invested in the series) are going to watch anyways...  So AMC/HBO/Netflix have to appeal to casual viewers by adding shitty romance ships, dumb-ass cliffhangers and nonsensical twists...

That's why so may  good show turns into shitty soap operas by season 2 or 3 or 4 (with GoT holding out a bit longer than most).  The Walking Dead, Sons of Anarchy, Daredevil, Falling Skies, Dexter, LOST, The 100...

But he doesn’t know if he will be praised or blamed, and then his father’s knights walk in and he gets his answer.  Blame.  It is the moment he adopts his kingslayer persona and becomes the cynical knight we meet in AGOT.  

> Ser Elys Westerling and Lord Crakehall and others of his father's knights burst into the hall in time to see the last of it, so there was no way for Jaime to vanish and let some braggart steal the praise or blame. It would be blame, he knew at once when he saw the way they looked at him . . . though perhaps that was fear. Lannister or no, he was one of Aerys's seven.

> ""The castle is ours, ser, and the city,"" Roland Crakehall told him, which was half true. Targaryen loyalists were still dying on the serpentine steps and in the armory, Gregor Clegane and Amory Lorch were scaling the walls of Maegor's Holdfast, and Ned Stark was leading his northmen through the King's Gate even then, but Crakehall could not have known that. He had not seemed surprised to find Aerys slain; Jaime had been Lord Tywin's son long before he had been named to the Kingsguard.

>”Tell them the Mad King is dead,"" he commanded. ""Spare all those who yield and hold them captive.""

>”Shall I proclaim a new king as well?"" Crakehall asked, and Jaime read the question plain: Shall it be your father, or Robert Baratheon, or do you mean to try to make a new dragonking? He thought for a moment of the boy Viserys, fled to Dragonstone, and of Rhaegar's infant son Aegon, still in Maegor's with his mother. A new Targaryen king, and my father as Hand. How the wolves will howl, and the storm lord choke with rage. For a moment he was tempted, until he glanced down again at the body on the floor, in its spreading pool of blood. His blood is in both of them, he thought. ""Proclaim who you bloody well like,"" he told Crakehall. Then he climbed the Iron Throne and seated himself with his sword across his knees, to see who would come to claim the kingdom. As it happened, it had been Eddard Stark.

>”You had no right to judge me either, Stark.”","Absolutely. I have no idea why they did that.

But even the Bran scene is changed.  In the books, Bran is falling when Jaime lifts him up, ponders what to do, and then pushes him saying “the things I do for love” with self loathing.  In the show he simply pushes Bran out the window and makes the same statement into a jaunty quip.  

At the end of the day, in either case, he still tries to kill a child, which is obviously the wrong decision.  They are only in the situation because of the inexcusably reckless and selfish decision to have a treasonous relationship and children to begin with.  But still, the context is gone - as is [GRRM’s moral question](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/game-of-thrones-season-3-characters_n_1854918?guccounter=1):

""Obviously a lot of people, when Jaime throws Bran out the window, and we like Bran, we've seen his good points, tend to think that makes Jaime a bad guy. But then you understand, if you understand the situation, if Bran goes back and tells what the saw, and is believed, Jaime will be put to death, his sister will be put to death, and there's an excellent chance that his own children will be put to death.” .

The show clearly doesn’t even want to grapple with questions like this.  Not when it can just be glib and shocking.  In this scene, as in many others, it not only darkens Jaime, it removes all the subtlety and complexity, for no reason at all, except maybe they thought it would be funny to make pushing a child out a window into a joke.","Oh for fucks sake, will you shut your hole?","I really do wonder if D&D realized how shitty they were making the Starks look, and how Bran looks kinda, well, evil, after appearing to know how everything would turn out, and doing nothing to alter it.",I can't believe Ned lost his head for treason but Sansa gained a crown 🤬,"Season eight's message was basically; lie and betray, and you'll be rewarded for it.",Does this reminds anyone of stereotype how women can't keep secret?,"Don't worry someone in Braavos knows Arya has sailed west and a Faceless Man is on the job.

He threw a little boy from the top of a tower --> But we see his redemption.

Jon killed a ranger to infiltrate the Wildling, betrayed his oath by sleeping with Ygrid, and abandoned the woman he loves behind him to return to the Night Watch --> It's normal, he had to survive, the cause prevails.

Tormund participated in the massacre of Olly's village: The fandom loves him. He is so funny and loves Brienne.

Sam broke his oath to be with Gilly --> It's normal, he's human.

Jon delivered his kingdom to a mass murderer in the making (while he could have remained her ally) while his own people and family told him that he did not want her as ruler --> He saw that she was a great queen, that's normal.

Daenerys has flouted all the rules of war and morality by burning alive a whole population --> We must be understood, all her relatives are dead and people are mean to her.

Sansa breaks a promise (which Jon obliges her to do BECAUSE Daenerys forces him to keep HIS identity secret) in order to protect her brother, her family and the North --> She deserves death! It's a dirty traitress.

What hypocrisy!

Robb broke a promise to marry Talysa. Ned scoffed at his honor by lying to save his daughter. Catelyn secretly released Jaime to save her daughters and so on.

**All the characters broke promises, lied and deceived to survive, protect their loved ones and so on.**

&#x200B;

Plus, Sansa no longer believes in the gods. Even though this place is sacred, it no longer has the same meaning for her as before.

And **doesn't the safety of her family prevail over a promise made to a brother completely under the influence of a tyrant?**

Ned kept the secret to protect Jon from the one on the throne, Robert. But now, the one who wants to take the throne is one of the only ones aware of Jon's identity!

Sansa is afraid, she tells Tyrion that. The South tends to kill the men of her family. And when she sees that even Tyrion is afraid of Daenerys, she can no longer keep the secret. **By revealing it to a man she trusts, she hopes to protect her brother and the North from the tyrant Daenerys is becoming.**

**Don't forget that Daenerys, before even knowing that Sansa told the secret, thinks Jon is betraying her. This shows her paranoia and the danger that Jon represents for her.**","Gasp.  Is there a real player in this game that wouldn't have broken a promise to politically knee an enemy in the stomach.   Sansa didn't send a letter to every town crier in Westeros, she told Dany's own hand.  She wanted a slow poison so that everyone could still work against Cersei but the political foundation of Dany's reign would start to erode.

If Dany can't hang onto her sanity because one girl can't stand her and schemes to get what she wants then she was never cut out to be a Queen.  Had Dany ascended to the Throne Sansa likely would have faced Treason charges, which was why Jon did what he did.  Sansa did what everyone in this story has done, schemed to get what she wanted, which was an independent North.

Sansa told Tyrion, he could have gotten the news and kept it to himself.  Sansa's little game would have died there (or maybe not).  Why is Sansa responsible for what other characters (most credited as older and smarter then her) do?  Tyrion chose to tell.  Varys chose to turn.  Dany chose to burn Kings Landing.  Whom in this story hasn't been schemed against?  Not all of them went on mass killing sprees.   Poor Dany was grieving.  Sansa was once grieving for the death of her Father, Mother and Brother, didn't stop anyone from plotting to manipulate and harm her (Tywin, Cersei, Tyrion, Olenna, Margaery, Littlefinger).

I've never heard a genuine reason Sansa should subjugate her own wants and goals for those of Dany.   Why does Sansa have to sit down, smile and be a good girl?  She's seen what can happen to The North when it is beneath the heel of the Iron Throne.  The Lannisters (empowered by their control of the Iron Throne) married Sansa to Tyrion to gain control of Northern Succession.

After all that happened, to return the North to being back underneath the heel of the Iron Throne, all so Princess Dany can get everything she wants would have been the biggest betrayal of the show.",Sansa did it because jon was in danger from Dany.  She told Tyrion right after she said she didn't want jon going south because starks don't do well in the south.  It was a good thing she told Tyrion because Dany ended up dead instead of killing her way across their world.,"""Why do you think I came all this way.""

Instead they basically edited the line to fit seamlessly into a low budget sitcom.","If you are a shirty person, you can never improve and will die just as horrible as you always were.

If you do nothing, you will get rewarded for it.",Do nothing and you can be king or queen in the end.,Along with women go crazy when spurned by lover,"Not really.  She;s played fast and loose with truth and lies since the beginning, which was exacerbated by her training with Littlefinger.  But many characters have betrayed secrets and betrayed people have been very common.  Tyrion betrayed Sansa's secret (I assume she told him it was a secret) telling Varys, then he betrayed Varys to Dany, getting Varys killed.  Reek told Sansa's secret to Ramsay.  The Lannisters often told lies to each other.  The main difference is that Sansa had made a solemn promise to her entire family under the Heart Tree.","Change House Stark's words from ""Winter is Coming"" to ""Fuck You, Got Mine!"" 

Sansa *and* Arya basically became Lannisters in the end.","Oh, Starks became a leaders of the North not through Love and Friendship. They just returned to the old ways.","> She wanted a slow poison so that everyone could still work against Cersei but the political foundation of Dany's reign would start to erode. 

Why would sharing the information with Dany's hand cause this? Jon didn't want to be king. Sansa telling people about his birth wasn't going to magically make him king. Her ""plan"" had no logical end point. The writers just used her to drive the plot.

You say this:

>Sansa did what everyone in this story has done, schemed to get what she wanted, which was an independent North. 

Then say:

>Sansa told Tyrion, he could have gotten the news and kept it to himself.  Sansa's little game would have died there (or maybe not).  Why is Sansa responsible for what other characters (most credited as older and smarter then her) do?  Tyrion chose to tell.  Varys chose to turn.

Dany didn't step down when she found out about jon though did she?  She knew the people would prefer him to her, but she was only prepared to have him by her side killing everyone. 

Dany planned on harming Sansa.  Did you miss her speech about liberating Winterfell?  Who was she liberating it from?  The lady of Winterfell.

No assumptions here, my claim stands that Sansa told Tyrion because she was worried about jon.

She was inconsistent in her judgements executing a slave for killing a master without a trial then throwing a slaver at her dragon without a trial.

D&D took over and started butchering like crazy. GRRM gave them whatever he had but they went nuts with it.,">if they were shit, they would still be the better ending to GoT

Perhaps, but I think the issue became as the show got more and more acclaim and viewers, GRRM lost his ground to overrule D&D.  Feast and Dance were not as strong of books and have so many meandering plot points which are not adaptable.

It's possible after Season 4, GRRM was fine to just let them do what they wanted.

However, he also walked away and didn't keep supervising the idiots. He could have stayed more involved and at least read the scripts and raise red flags about bad writing. Maybe there was some amount of letting D&D dig their own graves. But he gave them the ending and the main plot points were from GRRM.  So, it might be a situation where GRRM did not give them more information because GRRM was unhappy about them changing things. Essentially, GRRM saying if they aren't going to listen to me, I'm not giving them anything else. 

That doesn't excuse the ending since D&D could have used their brains to actually come up with logical reasons the ending could happen and foreshadowing to explain the events. GRRM isn't to blame for that.

No. 

I thought not. It's not a story r/gameofthrones would tell you. It's a great tragedy. Benioff and Weiss were showrunners of the first live adaptation of Game Of Thrones.. 

Indeed...  these writers were so blessed to have a massive budget and excellent directors and actors they could influence HBO to give them season after season as the shows best plot points and stories had already been mostly written for them by George RR Martin, they leaned so much on Martin that they believed they could cut the plots they didn't like, and keep all of the various plot threads they cared about from dying. The dark side of Fandom is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. They became so arrogant and powerful... the only thing they was afraid of was being unable to complete the final two seasons on their own, which eventually, of course, they did. So they hitched their wagon to Star Wars, hoping to fail upwards, an old Hollywood tradition, cut the last season to six episodes for no good reason, and even blamed fans for being too 'toxic'. Unfortunately, even with Martin's notes they were such terrible writers they botched just about every plot line and even angrily rejected help from directors and even the actors themselves when they complained about the illogical nature of the conclusion. Ironic really, their stubbornness and lack of talent killed the show... gave a boost to the r/freefolk, and even caused them to lose the Star Wars movie they'd been promised before the completion of show. 

Is it possible to watch their ending?

Daenerys was the mother of 3 Dragons, who became so powerful they provided her with a tactical advantage and prestige in her battles. She acquired a large army of Dothraki and Unsullied. She was determined to end slavery injustice and reclaim the Iron Throne. She established herself as a powerful and relentless ruler. The only thing she was afraid of losing was her birthright to the Throne, which eventually, of course she did. Unfortunately due to rushing the final seasons, plot holes, writing and pretty much everything else by D&D, they ruined her character and pretty much everything else.

But your mistake is thinking that Game of Thrones will still be popular in ten or twenty years. The sad fact is that it won't be. It will be remembered as an embarrassment and a failure. There (probably) won't be an attempt to remake GoT anymore than there will be to remake Lost, or Dallas, or St. Elsewhere, or Avatar. The calculus in remaking a tv series or film isn't about how popular the franchise was at the time but how popular it is *now*. Does it have longevity? Do people still fondly remember the series and would they be excited about it coming back?

Like the whole joke of OP here is that the answer for GoT is depressingly ""no."" There's a pretty wide consensus in the fandom that not only did the show's ending suck, but it retroactively ruined the entire rest of the series because we now know that all the shit we spent years speculating about as they built it up meant nothing and was going nowhere.

And there's another one",Sauce?,"So to break it down a bit, the major flawed assumptions here

1) That Martin will finish the books

2) That the books will be a dramatic improvement on the show. I mean to be clear there's no way they'll be as bad as S8, but like, Martin has been pretty open that he is taking so long because he doesn't actually know how to tie together all the various plot threads out there in a satisfying manner.

3) That either HBO or the public have the appetite for more Game of Thrones when people have pretty clearly lost all interest in the story. 

4) That you can capture that lightning in a bottle again, which did after all depend on many show-specific elements like the stellar cast and like, as painful as this is to acknowledge, D&D's writing or,  more importantly, editing decisions as showrunners back when they gave a shit and were more custodians of Martin's work than having to write more than the odd scene or two from scratch. 

Like, the assumption that the show would do better with every single storyline intact is pretty bizarre, especially when what good will that still remains towards the series is directed towards its actors.

I'm from r/all by the way, come leave the sub for a bit, we got a couple interesting reasonable people out here.","D&D were really good at writing for their actors, which is probably one reason so much of the cast have been willing to stand by them despite the shit ending. The ones that have spoken out have been mainly the ones whose characters got boned the hardest but like, even Emilia has been hedging pretty hard while still being clearly upset about the ending.

Like when people point to the good scenes written by D&D in the book-era seasons it's all character moment/development stuff that lets actors flex their chops. It's not structural, narrative stuff that really advances the plot in any way. And even in the later seasons when things are falling apart, there are still genuinely good character scenes- like the conversation between Jaime and Olenna is one of the best scenes in the series, despite not really being relevant or even coherent from a plot perspective.

But yeah the way they just gave up and wouldn't let someone else that still cared finish is unforgivable.",I don't think this is true. If this was true they wouldn't have rushed the final season. D&D own the adaption rights and that's why the show ended the way it did. HBO and GRRM wanted to do 2 or 3 more seasons but D&D were to fucking greedy and wanted to do Star Wars. They actually stated that they have been doing this show for so long that they wanted to move on.,"Eh, not all anime. Anime is hugely popular...everywhere. It has quite a market. It's not just anime, either - look at the Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse movie. It did really well financially and commercially. Look at the Batman Animated Series or Young Justice. Look at Avatar, as much as I hate it. 

Animated shows can absolutely succeed. And being ''animated'' won't take away from the political intrigue and realism that makes GoT so good. In fact, it would enable much better storytelling.",It's Damascus steel,"We had to say aluminum, because the Kaiser had stolen our word for steel.

And this is the only reason HBO needs. They wanted the show to last ten seasons or more because it printed money. IF GRRM finishes the books with an even remotely satisfying ending then it makes complete sense to give it another go. HBO is already doing this with the Sopranos and Deadwood. I wish they would with Carnivale but THAT would be naive.","I have no doubt they had creative oversight on the show. That’s what a show runner is. That doesn’t mean they own any rights to the material or show itself. 

It’s the same with other creators and show runners- FX owns Sons of Anarchy & the spin-off The Mayans. Kurt Sutter created that universe and (at least for SOA) had complete oversight and creative control. He decided when the show ended and how it went out. But now he’s no longer contractually attached to FX (Now a Disney subsidiary) he has no say in what happens to that franchise. If FX wants to reboot it he can jump up and down all he like on social media but FX owns the IP and would have it locked down tight in contracts and will do what they want. 

D&D wanted out. HBO agreed to let them out. I’m guessing they were contractually obligated to make an 8th season but considered they wanted out they made it clear they wouldn’t be doing more and lined up other deals (SW, Netflix) leaving HBO to either let them finish or start with a fresh show runner.","I feel like you’re misunderstanding what I’m saying here.

Daenerys was the mother of 3 Dragons, who became so powerful they provided her with a tactical advantage and prestige in her battles. She acquired a large army of Dothraki and Unsullied. She was determined to end slavery injustice and reclaim the Iron Throne. She established herself as a powerful and relentless ruler. The only thing she was afraid of losing was her birthright to the Throne, which eventually, of course she did. Unfortunately due to rushing the final seasons, plot holes, writing and pretty much everything else by D&D, they ruined her character and pretty much everything else.

Mandalorians as a concept only exist because of Boba and Jango. But, George said the Fetts aren't actual Mandalorians. As a weird a compromise, the Lucasfilm story group decided that Mandalore doesn't consider them Mandalorians, but Jango and Boba might consider themselves Mandalorian.

Fire a gun you get recoil? That'd push back on the gun. No issue. But firing in space wouldn't mean the bullet fires faster instead just farther.  So you'd need a big gun or some way of getting enough kinetic energy to penetrate a huge star destroyer that's already layered with armour. Plus a lot of modern tank shells use high explosives that detonate once penetrated.  Not very effective in space where fire cant burn.

So yes slugthrowers would work against shielded individuals but the huge armour alone helps ships and would require huge guns. Whilst it seems lasers like ours are powered by electricity or such source that's easier generated by say a reactor.  So you can get the same bang less size and power.

I do remember the start of episode 3 but droids loading big cannons with what look like shells that fired lasers/plasma.  My dad did say ""why do they have to reload like 18th century ships"" so it kinda did bother me too haha.

So yeah slugs are cool but seem less effective usually.  Even in Halo more plasma causes more horrific injuries than bullets due to fact it goes through armour and almost melts the person.  We usually see in star wars a good blaster bolt kills you instantly","I'm not saying it wouldn't prevent a whole lot of injuries. Imagine a guy in a motorcycle helmet being shot out of a canon into a brick wall. The helmet is going to absorb the damage that would have crushed his skull, but he's going to have plenty of other issues.","I legit didn't know that. I thought the word ""mandalorian"" only refered to the people from Mandalor. Thanks for the info.","Is that still canon? AFAIK most of the Madalorian Lore was established in the Extended Universe.

If you show and adhere to the mandalor way then you can join them.

Did they use this during their wars earlier? Conquered people could either join or being enslaved? Though it did cause some coward and others to join that kinda weakened them","How so? In clone wars, mandalorians are from mandalore. They are like the Star Wars Spartans. 
According to the wiki, they are natives from the planet mandalore. 
Jango and Bobba Fett were not mandalorians, they just wore the armors because they’re cool and resistente. But they have no other bounds to the mandalorians.","Its legends and no longer applies in fact Taung are completely retconed from any lore whatsoever. Mandalorians are only human but they supposedly are okay with adopting other humans. Also Mandalorians come from a region around Mandalore itself, region which was the target of their original crusades. ( Though there were small groups spread over the whole galaxy too ) But all mandalorians regardless of place of birth have to visit Mandalore at least once or so. The thing about never taking off a helmet must be unique to this group or new addition as it wasnt a rule up untill the Mandalorian. ( though argubly they actually tried to keep them on since they are a great help ) The helmets they wear are based not on Taung but on Neo-Crusaders ( Mandalorians that were waging war on the Old Republic causing its downfall. The war was generations long and most of the stories technique equipment etc come from that war. )","Pretty sure The Taung stuff is ""legends"" continuity aka non canon for Disney.

He’s literally the guy in the suit unless it’s a stunt.","As idiotic as that guy is, Funhaus mentions in their movie podcast that there were theaters in LA showing the first three episodes.","I'm not understanding your first paragraph. You bring up Newton's law for the recoil but I don't get why that puts ships in space at a disadvantage. The opposite force counteracting the slug would have to be absorbed by something (presumably a bracing mechanism that absorbs the force like ropes did for cannons in 18th century) but that doesn't seem to be a large problem.

I do believe firing in space means that the slugs fire faster. At least in the sense that they aren't losing kinetic energy due to friction from air because they're in a vacuum. It would also mean that there's no drop-off because there's no gravity to pull them. 

I hadn't considered the impact of armor in my first post. Enough of it would definitely negate slugs, but I think they would still be useful for destroying a shield generator. The generator on the star destroyer was on the top of the ship and very out in the open. Is it a requirement for the effectiveness of a shield to be unsecured? I don't think the Destroyer's shield was armored too much due to the A-wing destroying it but there's no way of really knowing. 

On tank shells using explosives, couldn't star wars rounds just have the oxygen inside of the round? I suppose that might make it too big, but then again air can be compressed to a liquid to reduce the space needed. 

Yeah those guns in the beginning of EP 3 are just so wacky. ""Fire the broadside guns!"" 

I forgot the most effective slug of all. EP 8's hyperspace suicide. Make that into a gun and no armor can stop it. Maybe it is cost prohibitive, but I doubt it. Holdo's suicide wrecked the flagship and more. That would definitely be worth the cost of an X-wing or rather one X-wing per ship.","Sorry, I worded myself poorly, I meant my comment to be in agreement with your opinion. 

Totally agree that the helmet's strength has little to do with preventing injuries in many cases.","No problem :) I love sharing what I know about Star Wars, you should watch some YouTube videos on the tragic and insanely cool history of the mandalorians","I could be barking up the wrong tree but i think they also adopt others as the ""foundlings"" to expand their ranks","No, it's not. That's all EU stuff that wasn't carried over. If it's not from the movies or TV shows it's not Canon currently.

He eventually got disillusioned and left to bounty hunt on his own, but that's how he got the armor.","Yea I always forget all of the countless books I’ve read on starwars basically means nothing now lmao

You’re talking about a group of people who are from a society that mastered hyperspace travel going back to the steel age. No remnants of a space faring past existing. That’s absurd and wouldn’t happen.,I'd go. My money I'll spend it how I want,"I mean in the sense of the size of the gun that'd have to handle it and it's positioning on the ship to take that kind of recoil.  Plus the force to fire.  Also whilst bullets will be a little faster, lasers are technically light so will always be faster (just slow it  down in star wars or itd just be a weird light show)

Yeh the positioning and strength of its shields is an odd one. What I can see they need to be on the outside and act like a bubble. Mon Calamari ships have lots of bubble shapes around their ships that are all generators why the weird look but notoriously strong in that sense.  Plus rather than suicide small ships can simply fly through the shield and attack it anyway which would be easier than a big slug thrower that's only got 1 purpose. 

See again that's only ignite the fire but not sustain it.  Modern explosives use a large amount of oxygen around them when they explode.  It's just not be practical or get the same result.  Only practical and seemingly time slugthrowers are used is ground combat.  Supposedly Grievous before he was corrupted used it expertly.  Again though it means carrying around shells compare to a blaster that just recharges it seems.

Even in our time lasers are being developed into weapon systems due to accuracy. However large scale destructive lasers are difficult as we don't have the power sources to power them in a mobile environment (like in a tank) but I do think some developments green made? 

That was a silly thing IMO the whole kamikaze attack.  Plus I don't think it's actually proper destroyed. They cut it in 2 but they could just have used air locks to breach the gaps and retrieve the parts later.  Jumpers do the same thing and rebuild ships.

The Thrawn trilogy was so fucking good. But the character I miss the most from the EU is Mara Jade. For all of Disney's talk of ""strong female characters"", they have yet to make one, yet they ignored Mara Jade, a character with an interesting backstory and strong character arc.",By that stage it was a numbers game in the war that they ended up losing that is in part to the Jedi and losing Mandalore himself.,"True. But still doesn’t answer my question.

It's set after the fall of the empire, but before the rise of the first order. It's also been really well done.","It's a fresh new take on the ""orphan on a desert planet"" storyline.

More seriously: it's good, feels like a proper part of the Star Wars universe that just wants to tell one specific story well and doesn't need to be all about the fate of the entire galaxy.

Great performance from Pedro Pascal despite never removing his helmet, if he can keep that up  he can join Karl Urban in the ""we keep our protective headgear on and still deliver great performance"" club.","I don't care about lore, and I still liked it very much. It feels a lot like the original star wars. Strange aliens and worlds just shown ""matter of fact""-ly. Great use of background music and the lack there-of. The writing is done correctly. It moves us along but doesn't distract from the adventure aspect","100% worth it

Why focus on Jedi and sith? Why not focus on any other parts of the Star Wars universe?

It was enjoyable but kind of lack luster. By the end of last weeks episode I was hooked for more.,Lore friendly and pretty entertaining. I’d give it a 7-8 out of 10. It doesn’t do anything revolutionary but it’s a Star Wars TV show so it’s worth it,"tbh it's not very good so far, although I'm having fun watching it with the kids.

 * There's less dialogue than season 8 episode 6. Good dialogue is one of the things that made seasons 1 to 4 so excellent.
 * No memorable or distinctive characters - either a sidekick or a main bad guy - and that includes the Mandalorian himself. I guess he's a Clint Eastwood ""man with no name"" but there was something in those old westerns that got you attached to this silent guy who waded into a world of trouble.
 * Apropos of the above, the show cultivates a Western feel but there are no real staredowns or buildups of suspense. I always thought one of the hallmarks of a good western is not the gunfights themselves, but the building tension before the first shot is fired.
 * Although it has the entire Star Wars universe to draw from, you don't get the sense that the setting itself is a living character. Contrast that with the lawless post-Civil War profiteering in *The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly*, where the entire countryside made *Casablanca* look like a sleepy village where nothing ever happens.","Well I’m the no longer canon EU the conquered the planet and made it their own, slaying all the massive beasts their and leaving their bodies to rot and for their skulls to litter the landscape

She had a more likely evil turn than Dani, what with all the time she spent around the Lannisters and with Little finger.","Sansa's body language in this scene and later on, when Jon was elected as KITN, spoke a very clear language. Not to mention her ""I won the battle of bastards, you should be on your knees thanking me"" comment or her general dislike for the fact that Brienne was also loyal to Arya in season 7.

That's why Sansa-stans who pretend that everybody hates Sansa unfairly annoy me so much. The dialog, the script comments and the general direction of the show suggested that Sansa is self-serving and at least flirting with villaindom. If her fans want to criticise others for the fact that she is perceived negatively they should criticise D&D, not the fans who merely react to what they were show and told.","Sigh, one of the best episode, but every time I think of GoT I get mad and disappointed.",Two Sansa stans handled the latter seasons and botched it to the point of no return.,"Yup.

She was influenced by Littlefinger and Cersie to be manipulative, but that doesn't mean she's going to abandon her entire identity to become exactly like those two power hungry individuals. she uses that manipulation against her enemies but there's no evidence she has desired usurping power from family members.","I didn't see any of this.

&#x200B;

It is true Sansa is flirting with darker impulses and is struggling to handle it.  She's become ultra paranoid and she's surprised to find out her little sister is actually a skilled assassin. And her younger sister loved/admired Jon more than she admired Sansa. I think D&D were toying with hiding plot twists (killing Littlefinger) but Sansa does have legit reasons to be suspicious of Arya (even if the viewer knows who she is and enjoys her character). Sansa admitted she is a slow learner and she's learning how to handle discontent in her family and manipulating political assets (Littlefinger). She's just starting out whereas Littlefinger has been down this road many times. Sansa is struggling to connect with a sister who has changed a lot, had some ill feelings from the past, and had different outlook of world. 

Just because she is struggling with trust issues doesn't mean she is seeking power for power sake. Just because she learned from Cersie and Littlefinger doesn't mean she's abandoned her identity in the North or her desire to rebuild her family and Winterfell's reputation. She wants return to normalcy but now knows she has to be more manipulative and political to get it. That's where her heart is, rebuilding her family and rebuilding Winterfell.

After Battle of Bastards, during the forehead kiss scene with Jon and the scene where Littlefinger tries to kiss her near the Weirwood Tree, you can sense Sansa is is no position to seek leadership. She wants a return to normalcy and to be with loved ones she can finally trust. She wants Jon to be the patriarch of the Stark family and to live in her parent's chambers. She wants to have a familial relationship with Jon that she lacked as a child. She is embarassed by her relationship with Littlefinger and the attacks on her reputation for marrying her enemies. she's disgusted by Littlefinger's desire to pursue her over a throne located in area she was abused but doesn't know how to deal with. she wasn't in the right mental state to seek power. she still raised in an environment to look towards honorable men as leaders. If you keep those inner motivations in mind, it should be clear that despite Sansa's desire to manipulate her surroundings, she's not going to hurt her family. I think Sophie Turner played that pretty well.

Jon Sansa forehead kiss scene (Season 6 finale)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibXUScOskAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibXUScOskAQ)

Thus, I don't agree that Sansa is self-serving. In Season 4, she dreamed of re-building Winterfell (scene she built it with snow before smacking her cousin). that has been her motivation after escaping with Littlefinger. rebuilding her family. that is her soft spot. so despite the sibling struggles, mistrust, pain, she wants everything to return to how it was before she left Winterfell. although she has fantasies of love and marrying a nice king/knight in shining armor, her top priority is rebuilding Winterfell and creating a fantasy. Her fantasy with marrying Joeffrey as a naive girl wasn't based on a desire for politics and manipulation and thirst for power, but on fairy tale view of love.  She realized her view of love was naive and has learned the hard way she has to be more vigilant about people's motives. 

I didn't see Sansa upset with Brienne's ""loyalty"" to Arya. I think she was surprised the young girl playing with broom sticks is now a skilled assassin. She thought Arya was joking but is disturbed by the practice fight scene between her and Brienne. I didn't see any concern from Sansa bout Brienne not being loyal.

&#x200B;

It is inconsistent with character shown on screen that Sansa would desire power at the expense of rebuilding the family she had previously lost.","Exactly my feelings after watching this and remembering all the emotions of this great episode

As I said, I took the time and read a couple of those comments, which is why I know that this isn't the case. After all it's canon that Jon isn't romantically interested in Sansa and that Sansa isn't romantically interested in Jon. Everything else is fanfiction. And the fact that you ignore canon in this instance and try to sell your personal interpretation/preference as facts makes it obvious that the same will happen in this discussion. 

As a matter of fact it already did, since this is pretty much a whole paragraph of your **personal interpretation presented as facts:**

Northern Lords: Aye!!!

<Jon turns head and looks at Sansa. Sansa turns head towards Jon and stares into his eyes. This all happens while Dany, who is publicly perceived as the love of Jon's life, is sitting to Jon's left and is out of scene. he doesn't even look at Dany at all in this time of confidence of crisis.>

now the reason why those things happen, that's up to interpretation and we can all have different interpretations,..... but the facts I've mentioned above ARE CANON as they are DIRECT word for word scenes from the show.

I think one should be allowed to use common sense to interpret those factual incidents from the book and show. if that is forbidden, then this place isn't as 'free' as folks would have you believe.",">am I not allowed to give my interpretation of facts and cite them? Is this what FreeFolk stand for? Can you establish what canon one can or cannot accept?

You are allowed to do whatever you want since I am neither your boss nor your parent. But I am also allowed to be dubious when someone presents subjective, personal interpretations as facts, and that's what you do. 

>are you upset with me because of my study of Jonsa theory? I hear that's forbidden here. is that it? 

The fact that you call shipping two fictional characters ""study of  Jonsa theory"" and think that others are upset because you want them to hook up shows pretty well why people don't take you guys serious around here. 

>why is that an issue when we're not even talking about Jonsa in this thread?

Again, shipping Jonsa is no problem at all, the fact that you try to sell them as canon, despite the fact that they didn't happen on the show and that GRRM went out of his way to tell us that they will never happen in books, is.   
It shows that you ignore everything that isn't in agreement with your head-canon, which makes a discussion pointless. 

>here's **what is canon** (actual quote from the show):

Nice, and I have a bunch of lovely scenes where Dany and Jorah lovingly stare at each other, hold hands and pet each others face, which I will totally and forever interpret as romantic. Sadly that's not where the show went, which makes it my head-canon. 

>that's fine if you don't agree with my or others interpretation, but you have to be consistent to make sure you're not pushing your interpretation as well. just make sure you're being consistent.

I am, which is why I don't pretend that Jorah is Dany's love interest just because I would have loved him to be. 

>now the reason why those things happen, that's up to interpretation and we can all have different interpretations,..... but the facts I've mentioned above ARE CANON as they are DIRECT word for word scenes from the show.

Yes, the scenes are canon, but your interpretation of their facial expression isn't. 

>I think one should be allowed to use common sense to interpret those factual incidents from the book and show. if that is forbidden, then this place isn't as 'free' as folks would have you believe.

Again, you can do whatever you want, or did I somehow miss that you were banned from this sub for your opinion? But if your ""commons sense"" goes against what the writer of the story himself says and you still portray it as factual people won't be very interested in a discussion with you.","sign, I'm trying to say this respectfully, you are free to disagree with my interpretation of scenes. that's perfectly fine. I just think you're being incredibly inconsistent because you're pushing interpretation of Sansa's motive using sketchier reasoning and lacking citation while demanding others you agree with adhere to what you consider to be canon.  where is the evidence that Brienne is loyal to Arya over Sansa, as you claim in your post from yesterday? Where is this comment that folks that Sansa thinks or says ""I won the battle of the Bastards and folks and folks should be on your knees thanking me."" I don't see support for that anywhere, it seems completely made up using stretching extrapolation and interpretation of scene. you have no support for it but you present it with no citation. yet, when I provide actual links you request I be ignored because of past post history and some absurd categorization of posters. 

&#x200B;

can you provide link where GRRM says it will never happen in the books?

&#x200B;

anyway, I'm not even suggesting that they will have a romantic relationship in the books. Jon and Sansa don't have an active romantic relationship in the traditional sense on the show. I agree that is canon. I fully agree with that. neither one of them suggests or does anything to suggest initiation of or ongoing activity towards a romantic relationship. so I agree with you there. 

&#x200B;

**However**, I think is plenty evidence of the show points to Jon and Sansa are repressing romantic thoughts and interest. It is reasonable to interpret body language (staring into each other eyes, heavy breathing, weird jealous or extreme behavior). there's also other scenes where Jon and Sansa are paired up in similar fashion as other romantic couples. Jon slams Littlefinger's throat to the wall when he says he loves Sansa the same way Ned did when Littlefinger said Catelyn is inside his whore house in Season 1. that's canon. Sansa has weepy eyes as Jon rides away on his horse same way Ned did in Season 1 when Catelyn rode away on her horse. 

&#x200B;

The question now is WHY do Jon and Sansa behave like this? we can have all different interpretations, but I think there's one clearly obvious one staring everyone in the face that seems to make a lot of people on this site angry and intimidation tactics are used to silence them. that is ridiculous. to dismiss it requires shutting down all sort of common sense. 

&#x200B;

The next question is if this theory of repressed romantic interest is true, what relevance does it have to the plot. One would argue it is relevant to the finale where Jon stabs Dany to the chest and can be linked to Jon and Tyrion's dialogue about love vs duty. There is  clearly plausible theory. 

&#x200B;

I think the show has given enough evidence of how certain characters behave 

I think the show chose not to make it incredibly obvious and instead leave it ambiguous for several reasons: (1) let the audience do the work and thinking without training wheels that were present in Season 1 through 6. (2) hide plot twists, which Season 7 and 8 clearly had, (3) marketing reasons. that's my theory, but I think its a plausible one. I 'm not pretending I have insider knowledge or confirmation. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Using 'shame language' to discourage arguing the theory by stating 'its not canon' seems deceptive. all I ask is that you do the same for the theory you presented above. you don't have any canon evidence that Sansa was worried about Brienne's loyalty to Arya. you too are interpreting facial expressions or what have you in way that seems to lack support or consistency with other evidence. other evidence shows Sansa trusts Brienne, so not sure why Sansa would doubt her now.",">sign, I'm trying to say this respectfully, you are free to disagree with my interpretation of scenes. that's perfectly fine. I just think you're being incredibly inconsistent because you're pushing interpretation of Sansa's motive using sketchier reasoning and lacking citation while demanding others you agree with adhere to what you consider to be canon.  where is the evidence that Brienne is loyal to Arya over Sansa, as you claim in your post from yesterday?

I said that Sansa disliked the fact that Brienne is also loyal to Arya, which comes directly from [the script](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/12/game-of-thrones-scripts-secrets-cersei-pregnancy-tyrion-daenerys-snow-on-the-throne). She gets ticked off watching her sister and Brienne spar in the courtyard and worries that Brienne might be an ally for Arya. ""*This disturbs Sansa""; ""The woman she thought was her dedicated protector is actually a time share.""* And if you, for some reason, think that Vanity Fair is anti-Sansa, feel free to google the quotes.

>Where is this comment that folks that Sansa thinks or says ""I won the battle of the Bastards and folks and folks should be on your knees thanking me."" I don't see support for that anywhere, it seems completely made up using stretching extrapolation and interpretation of scene. you have no support for it but you present it with no citation. yet, when I provide actual links you request I be ignored because of past post history and some absurd categorization of posters.

[""You should be on your knees thanking me, you're standing in Winterfell because of me. You didn't win it back, Jon didn't win it back. He lost the battle of the Bastards. The knights of the Vale won the battle, and they rode North for me.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6FuC89uFUQ)is a direct quote from the show and has absolutely nothing to do with me interpreting anything.

And again, providing links to scenes doesn't prove your personal interpretation of those scenes. The only thing they do prove is what is explicitly shown, said or mentioned in the scripts to those scenes.

You know what my dad would most likely do if a highly violent psychopath told him that he intended to take advantage of his little sister? Attack him. Most big brothers are protective of their little sisters and Jon's reaction didn't look romantic at all without confirmation bias googles. As for Cat+Ned = Jon+Sansa, why would anybody think that Jon even subconsciously strives to imitate the relationship his dad had to his emotionally abusive stepmother? I know D&D and GRRM have pretty fucked up views when it comes to childhood abuse, but even those three didn't go there, so why are you guys?

Here you are accusing people who don't support your ship and your far-fetched head-canon of ""shutting down all sort of common sense"", very respectful. Ever considered that rude shit like this is why people get angry? Or the disgusting comments Jonsas made in regards to Dany's character way before season 8 even aired? Nope, must be ""intimidation tactics  used to silence you"" because Jonsa is just too real for the peasants.

what does you or your dad have to do with the story?

I'm not disagreeing that big brothers are protective of little sisters. 
I'm not saying the scene can't be interpreted that way. Actually, first time I saw the scene I probably thought that. I actually came to conclusion about Jon and Sansa very late (start of Season 8). I had no idea of existence of Jonsa when I watched season 6 or 7 the first (and only time). In fact, if someone had mentioned that back then, I'd have dismissed it immediately. Watching season 8 threw off a huge red flag which led me to do research and rewatch season 6 and 7. 

I find it suspicious the producers direct scenes almost exactly the same way as his father when protecting his wife (deja vu). or the scene where they are saying goodbye as the same way as their parents. Neither Jon nor Sansa were in the vicinity of their parents during the respective scenes I mentioned. that seems like an artistic choice of trying to create parallels. parallels that on the surface would seem unnecessary if they are repeating knowledge that we already know. 
how a writer can use analogies or metaphors to convey an idea, the director and producer is creating parallels between scenes and the question becomes why are they doing that? repeatedly. they do this multiple times throughout the show. why do they do this repeatedly? they did this back in Season 6. if Season 8 was the only season they did this, I can interpret it to D&D trolling to fan base feedback, but they do this almost immediately when Jon and Sansa reunite in Season 6. why? 

I don't think I need to respond to your assertion of Jon's psychology, because you're doing what you're are accusing me of doing. You're engaging in arm chair psychology of a character. I can do the same. not saying you can't interpret it your way, just that you're engaging in the same extrapolation and interpretation of a character's motives without support. 

Jon admires his father, Ned. I don't see it as a stretch he might subconsciously or consciously adopt his courting habits in a way that might not be totally appropriate.  

Jon is attracted to red headed women (the show goes to great length to show Jon chose a red headed Ros to be with back in Winterfell). As a man, I'll say its unusual for men to focus on the color of a woman's hair, but they deliberately have Sam Tarly ask Jon what color was her hair. They wanted the viewer to know Jon has a thing for red heads. Then he gets with Ygritte. Then is paired up with Sansa, considered one of the most attractive women in Westeros right afterward who has the same rare hair color. The show draws parallels between Jon and Ned and between Catelyn and Sansa. 
The show has scenes where Jon/Ygritte are standing in similar position as Jon/Sansa. This is a choice D&D likely made. I can excuse one coincidence, but it seems a stretch when its done repeatedly. 

Martin is a writer that likes to go outside the box and make parallels between scenes and ideas. The show uses these techniques which I think should send a signal to the viewer without having to actually say something out loud.","sign09, with all due respect, I feel that attributing comments other ""Jonsa"" posters and theoriests you've seen to me is in appropriate. I don't know, maybe others have made poor efforts at communication. perhaps that is the case, but I don't know. I just you should respond to posters individually, not as membership of a group and stereotyping them. if you don't want to respond to posters, that is fine, but it seems dismissing a viewpoint because you want to ascribe them to a group seems premature.

in response to your comment by George RR Martin. the translated comment says probability that Jon will come back in the books is 'remote'. We'll see if that is the case, but it seems like he's being bit coy here. if Winds of Winter comes out and Jon is dead, then I'll accept that (and thus) but I think that statement if it is correct seems intended to hide information instead of reveal.  
he says that Jon will not marry Sansa, which I think is a fair statement, that doesn't happen in the show and seems unlikely. the translation is very poor so I'm going to need the original English or a better one because it uses incomplete or run-on sentences. Saying that A and B do not think of each other a certain way DOES not mean they can't think of each other a different way in the future. 

so we'll see. only way to get confirmation is when (or rather IF) the book ever comes out. 

in regard to your other 2 quotes, I'll accept them. she had heat with her sister and she wants to get respect for her loyalty and initiative to bring back Winterfell. she is the one who goaded and pushed Jon to build an army and she's the one who manipulated Littlefinger to send an army. so yes, she does deserve thanks and appreciation, although she says it in an exagerreated defensive way since Arya is critiquing her loyalty to the Stark family rather harshly. I don't see how that extends to a villainious turn. she is defending her reputation. Jon is very forgiving person and forgave her the first time in that forehead kiss scene and their reunion. he doesn't hold grudges and Sansa seems to appreciate him for that. Arya is not the same way, she holds grudges for long time and so Sansa has to defend her reputation to her. 

another thing we can't be certain of is whether or not Sansa and Arya are performing publicly for Littlefinger and any spies watching. that is a possibility and feedback about it has been all over the place. I've heard all sort of rumors, but it doesn't make a big difference at this point, in my opinion, given they united to kill Littlefinger.  

your quotes don't indicate that she is consolidating power away from Jon or at the expense of her family, only that she believes its unfair that she have her loyalty questioned.","I allow myself to intervene in this conversation:

I am happy to forget about it to be honest. It just lost its appeal for me. Like George Martin said, he doesn't let his characters live in circumstances with slim chances of survival. That show turned this rule on its head along with several other things. I suppose they forgot about everything. 😆

So to answer your question, I'm still a fan, just of the books and the tv show scenes i liked pre the fuck up. Like the chicken scene.","I have been selling cable for a 5 years. 

It was inevitable to have conversations with customers about it regularly. 

Easily one out of 20 customers we would talk to mentioned it, so about twice daily on a normal sales day. 

That's a ton for a premium channel as most people just mention news, local sports and cartoons. 

Nobody has mentioned it for months now. Its almost spooky.","It's pretty crazy, I mean look how many people hate the star wars prequels, but love star wars.","That’s an interesting point.

Anyway, the first line was ""Winter is coming!"" 

I facepalmed. I was sad to see reference to the show. I'm sad that the show ended so badly, that all the great references and quotes that would be great to drop just feel hollow now. Oh well.","Mass Effect, maybe?  The betrayal of the ME3 ending still hurts.","I don’t like to dwell on negativity. I do fondly remember the first time I watched the show. They were showing back to back episodes of season 1 during our summer holidays. I guess it was in the lead up to season 2 airing. I recorded them on our DVR and sat down late one night in the air conditioned lounge with a nice scotch and started episode 1, not having any idea what I was getting in to. I didn’t need to work the next day. I watched four episodes that first night.

I promised myself to read the books when the show was finished. Now I’m halfway into book 3. The books just do such a better job of developing the characters, portraying the realities of the kingdom at war, getting the sense of scale and time right. I understand that the show didn’t have the time and budget to do that, especially early on. I actually think they did quite well for a while.

I’m pretty happy for my brain to just forget the show. I only think of the actors faces and some of the general look and feel from the show now, and let the books take me on a fresh journey.",Definitely noticed this,Maybe The Walking Dead but at least it's still a watchable show.,"Yeah. I’m currently reading the books. Slowly. Right now reading A Clash of Kings. Daenarys is a lot more tougher than she appears in the show. Even though young it’s like she’s lived two lifetimes. Lost a husband and a son. And hoping she herself doesn’t go mad like Viserys. But even up to this point the story points to a similar ending for KL like it was on the show. This may of course change the further I read or with future books. 

But I have to be honest. As time goes on, I have little to no hope that the last 2 books will ever be finished. If they will be completed I doubt many will care.",The same goes for the Star Wars sequels,"I see the prequels as almost the exact opposite of the final season. while the final season was a rush job to get it over with by showrunners who didn't care, the prequels were made with love and care by Lucas and that comes through regardless of the quality of the actual films.","Isn't the quote ""Nobody hates star wars more than star wars fans""?",Twilight was a fad honestly.,"Breaking Bad got *two* 10/10 series finales.

I think you will really enjoy the plot twists and stories. They are completely different to the show, don't worry.

Yeah, who knows when he will finish. In the mean time, I'd recommend reading the king killer chronicles, all the robin hobb books in order (very good x1000000) but maybe not her soldier son series.

I'm almost finished it and i have loved every page!",Prequels are better than sequels too.,By hiring actual writers with actual ideas.,"True. Hoping maybe one day once all the books are completed that maybe they can do some realistic animated version of the books since I know no one involved in the show wanted to commit anymore time to it.

&#x200B;

No seriously, I have a real explanation for it.

&#x200B;

Why snow falls when Jaime gets off Kl = holla there winter is here.

Why there is no more snow in Kl the rest of the season = because it's cheaper to recycle the 3D model of the city of the old seasons and also to stick with the vision of Bran or he saw a dragon fly over the city

why the snow falls after = to stick with the vision in season 2

why there is more in the next scene = because this scene is shot in Spain and we had more budget for fake snow

in any case the weather and visions that are not fitting, confirms us that 2D had no idea where they were going with this story",We dunt wunt the snuw!,D&D ain't got time for Winter! Star Wars was calling.,"I remember season 7 ended with Jamie leaving KL as snowflakes fell on his glove. Then it showed the city getting dimmer with the sounds of a howling wind. I remember being so excited Cersei was going to be wrong and the dead would come south.

But nope! It was goddamn summer in s8","You forgot a screenshot of S7E7 when Jaime Lannister leaves Kings Landing and it starts snowing.

Just another dumbass mistake by dumb and dumber,A song of ice and fire.... chaos is a ladaahhh.,"Winter started at the end of Season 6 and wasn't quite over at the end of the show, so the Long Night wasn't a single night. That's just the battle for Winterfell.

But the real long night was the 55 days of night shoots for the cast and crew in bitter cold and wet weather. Instead of showing the audience the Long Night, D&D and Sapochnik put the cast and crew through the Long Night.",That  Jon Denver is full of shit man.,I duhn't wan' it,This is it.

Long night wasn’t 55 Day. They filmed it during 55 day. 


Last time when long night was in Westeros it continued years. Babies was born and died without summer. And when long night comes winter is in whole Westeros.",The city was full of ash after the rampage. So it wouldn't be a surprise if it was indeed ash. But snow after winter is gone? Wow that's d&d!,"I also thought it was ashes. It knew it didn't look quite right but what was I supposed to think, that winter began weeks after the Night King's death? Or that it would snow in summer in King's Landing?

Either way it would make no sen.. Oh, I see what you mean.",Your expectations were subverted 😁,I'm with you on Netflix. I'm still pissed they canceled Daredevil and the Punisher. I know it's a Disney thing but it still...They were the best damn things on there.,"Winter isn’t over just because the White Walkers were defeated, though... It’s still just a season, like any other.",Ashe isn’t white dear neither such a thick. What where Jon met with Drogon outside of castle. It’s completely snow. They already confirmed that. Kit said that Deogon was outside in snow,"I don't understand why everyone thinks winter is intricately connected to the Night King. It's just a season that happens every few years in Westeros (due to their weirdly long seasons). It's not the Night King making it snow everywhere and his death doesn't magically make it summer again. It's still winter in Westeros after he's dead and after Daenerys is dead, it's just that by then the show had given up on consistency in their sets.

Still sucks that they got an award attached to their name for Season 8 tho.","Yep, but still. After what they have done - to give an Award at least strange and not fair.","You’re right and I don’t understand why people seem to have a hard time grasping that it was a lifetime achievement award to honor everything else about the show.  The fact that they lost Best Director and Writing was the Emmys rejecting them and the last season...because even though Succession was a probable winner, who saw Jason Bateman winning?  D&D May have got Emmys for Best Drama but it wasn’t about them; it was about the actors, the crew and everyone else.  That’s why they were unusually subdued, for them that night.","To be honest, I tried getting into Succession and I just can't. I get bored, haha.",The bells the bells,"Correction:

1st Panel: When Starkkks and Tyrion are plotting against her

2nd Panel: When Varys plots against her

3rd Panel: Innocent civilians running away",Oof!,Fuck D&D,Sitting in that chair would be how I felt when I watched Season 8.,"There is a heap more evidence of last minute rewrites of season 7 and even season 8 around, including Dany [looking pregnant ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c518cg/spoilers_was_daenerys_supposed_to_be_pregnant/) in that Game Revealed promo and the season 7 DVD commentary which suggests Boatbaby and a meeting with Jon and Cersei (which was [was filmed](https://winteriscoming.net/2018/02/08/speculation-why-is-cersei-meeting-with-spoilers-during-season-8/), but it may well have been a deliberately fake scene).  Even the title of 805 is suggestive that something else was planned.  I mean, *bells*?  Unless they are meant to be some incredibly oblique reference to the Stallion Who Mounts the World (which has bells in its hair), or a nod to book readers that this is meant to involve Jon Connington and they are doing their best, the bells have no relevance at all to a story where Dany goes mad.  But bells could be very much what sends an isolated and losing Cersei over the edge...","I’ve literally been saying this for months! They very clearly threw out whatever their plans were for season 8 very late in the game and pulled this clusterfuck out of their asses. Probably in response to the season 7 leaks and a lot of it being predictable due to all the book prophecies. They were so obsessed with surprising the fans that they tried to go in the complete opposite direction of expected outcomes, regardless of coherence.","Lena Headley saying that she filmed a miscarriage scene should be enough evidence for several things: Cersei was meant to go mad, Dany was maybe preggars, Cersei most likely was meant to put wildfire in King's Landing and Dany was supposed to attack and kill everyone and maybe die by doing it?

I personally think they exchanged Jon x Dany's storyline with Cersei x Jaime's storylines. The last dialog between Jon and Dany fit Jaime x Cersei much more.

However, I think Dany would have died either way, just not killed by Jon. Jon I think was always meant to refuse the throne and leave it to Bran?

I think Bran being King is the only thing DnD got from George."," Cersei hearing the surrender bells ringing (by her soldiers, it was never her choice to ring them) and going nuts and burning the city would have made total sense. She is absolutely the type of person who would say “hell no, I’ll burn this place to the ground before I roll over and let you have it. If I’m dying anyway, I’ll take as many people with me as I can”. It makes way more sense than “Dany sees everything that was taken from her and makes a choice to make it personal by killing all the civilians who never took anything from her, while the person who did very nearly escapes”.","I def believe this.  Wish I could gold whomever pointed out that it was one of the D's idea to staple Deadpool's mouth (the literal ""merc with a mouth"") suggests he only wrote to shock people.  But when you don't stick to character and story integrity-it just comes off as cheap and insulting-which is what the show became.","I think King's Landing will probably burn, but either because Cersei goes Mad King, or she's about to, and Daenerys confronting fAegon will inadvertently set off the wildfire. 

So on a broad note, yeah, KL may burn, but the circumstances will be very different.","There was a spoiler early in the season that largely discussed this change and why.  It was discredited at the time, but so much of what was in it is now looking increasingly like it was true...","Some of that final scene between Dany and Jon reads a lot more like it should have been Jaime and Cersei too.  Not all of it, granted, but certainly that stuff about ""when I was a little girl and you were a little boy..."".  Not to mention the whole ""deceiving your girlfriend to get close enough to kill her"" thing.  Jaime would do it to stop another wildfire plot or protect someone else he loves.  BookJon would absolutely do it too.  But I-cannot-tell-a-lie ShowJon?   It just doesn't work. Everything about both Jaime and Jon in those final two to three episodes was completely off, as was Cersei.  It is just like they had been completely rewritten at the last moment ...","I assumed the Deadpool thing was because he wasn’t smart enough to write DP’s dialogue, so he just sewed his mouth shut and avoided the need.","Yep.  Another thing I’ve been saying for months... they gave the Jaime/Cersei ending to Jon and Dany. How many people had predicted that Cersei would try to destroy KL and Jaime would kill her to save lives, just as he did with the Mad King? Even Dany’s foreshadowed pregnancy and Cersei’s expected miscarriage pointed to it. Cersei losing her last chance to continue her legacy and then shortly after she learns the YMBQ is pregnant... she’s snapping for sure.","That seems like what they were setting up, for sure. Having the people being against Cersei would have made sense after she blew the Sept of Baelor.","It is pretty clear that they had something like that in mind, albeit perhaps Dany was going to do something extreme too.  Why they changed it is beyond me.  I have seen all kinds of explanations from subverting expectations to wanting to change the ending because of leaks to making a bid for the best actor and actress Emmies, but for all we know if was just some random decision that “felt right”, like Arya killing the night king.","I would go even further and say that they switched Jaimie's and Theon's ending too. I think Jaimie was supposed to die in the Winterfell protecting Bran (it was set up and forshadowed, even ""you are a good man"" line fits to Jaimie better, because Theon at this poind didn't need another redemption), Theon was supposed to fight with Euron and kill him, Arya was supposed to kill Cersei wearing Jaimie's face (but she kind of forgot she can do it). In the end maybe even the last conversation that Jaimie and Cersei had was meant for Jon and Daenerys (they talking that nothing is more important than their child).",HBO's gonna push this to get a writing Emmy aren't they.,Is that chicken wearing pants?!?,"2D wrote some good scenes with Littlefinger and Robert & Cersei in the first season.

Are you Tywin?,That's because Robert thought he faught so well and honorable at the trident.,"I see the point but I don't think it applies. Barristan was wounded halfway to hell at the Trident and came around to Robert (sort of) after bobby b had him spared and tended to instead of killed. Arthur Dayne was Rhaegar's BFF and his sense of honor would have compelled him to fight for the collapsing Targaryen dynasty anyway, Dayne would have almost certainly died at the end of the Rebellion even without the combat at the Tower of Joy happening.","> Do you really think the WW only had one plan for thousands of years?

That’ll be fun to look forward to.,"Try the Crusader Kings 2 AGOT mod, you'll spend hundreds of hours unlocking good endings","Netflix don't really have standards, 2D will get at least one season of their crappy series.","Everyone: ""Write an at least mediocre ending to the series and we'll be happy!""

2D: *Distracted* ""My preciousss Star Warsss moneysss. We wantsss it!!!!""",Lots of cunts,Nances,"Franchise seems to be shot. I'll even throw out a different kind of example. 2018 went to Disney World for the Food & Wine festival. In Epcot you tend to see a lot more adult-type shirts vs. other parks. I remember seeing GoT stuff everywhere. Went back this year, maybe saw one or two groups of people wearing GoT stuff for a bachelorette party or something (""He kneeled"" kind of stuff). It's fallen off big time. 

Meanwhile, I was wearing a Breaking Bad shirt and I had people coming up to me all day talking about Breaking Bad.","Many will, but also many won't. It might fail to meet board room expectations, which of course would be wonderful.",You know nothing of the masses.,"It's funny because that's what D&D specifically referenced as the gold standard. Man, they sure did miss the target by a mile with that season 8. FWIW I've been keeping up with Mr Robot, and if that doesn't take a major nosedive this season, it ranks up there as far as complete series go. There's 4 seasons and it was planned to only be 4 seasons from the beginning. There's an actual ending in mind from the beginning. Not this ""making it up as we go"" nonsense that ruined the last few seasons of GoT.",Also The Wire.,"Mitochondrial Eve............. Hey, lets settle on this primitive planet, and destroy all of our technology and literally TONS of usefull materials by flying the ships into the sun........................Wait, did Starbuck just vanish?....................The Cylons dont know HOW to build another resurrection ship? the single most important ship in thier society.....................The way they killed Callie....................do i need to go on?","Yeah, I'm curious too. I thought it was kinda clumsy, but it wasn't GOT Season 8 bad and there's still some fun parts to it.","They prioritized shock value over coherent story. They spent the entire series posing questions with no good answers. In the final season they should have been answering the questions but instead they were bringing up more questions. It felt like a lot of loose threads. A running joke in the fandom at the time was “They have a plan... the writers just don’t know what it is.” It was very clear that they had no idea where the story was going to go and were winging it in the 11th hour. Weaving the All Along the Watchtower lyrics into the plot was super corny. It was just a mess. 

And none of that even touched the fuckery of killing Starbuck, then bringing her back to life, then the “lol wait she was dead all along” twist at the end. 

It was another series that started out really strong and then suffered from creator hubris when they started getting a lot of attention for it. The interesting thing is that the head creator Ron Moore, his wife became a regular poster on the scifi.com message board. So you really got a good inside look into him through her, and it was kind of nauseating. The man was definitely full of himself. 

Anyway. I still think GOT had a worse ending. But BSG was a show I would cancel plans for, and I haven’t rewatched a single episode since the finale ended ten years ago. I don’t see myself rewatching GOT, either, so I can draw similarities there.","Play Halo 1 and 2 with the original graphics your first time through. They did a better job with Halo 2, but the remasters strayed a little from the original design aesthetic.","Like when I played as Jon Snow and took Stannis's offer. Married Val and then retook Winterfell. Stannis lost but I kept Winterfell, and eventually gained independence from the Crown. Found Rickon. Died. Played as Rickon. Married Val. Found Bran. Married Bran to Myrcella, she ended up becomming Queen.",Orcs/the river: I'll be taking this SW contact thankyouverymuch,Kneelers!,"I see you just made an edgy teen comment without any justification at all.  Physical sales of every disk media is falling dramatically; if people have HBO go or will get HBO max, there is no incentive to buy the series even if you still like it.  Saying ""PEOPLE = DUMB"" does not change that.  This has a steep price tag for maybe six more episodes than what people already have. The ending was not well received in general, and the show has no rewatchability because it depends on random shock and it ended so badly. The S8 DVDs by themselves can already be gotten cheap to complete any collection.",Same with The Good Place.,"Reading this gave me flashbacks. 

My favorite was them actually working the All Along the Watchtower song into the plot. What in the fuck? So corny. But I had forgotten about Hera being mItOcHoNdRiAl EvE. 

The music was always outstanding, though. Another thing BSG has in common with GOT. McCreary and Djawadi should collaborate on something.","See above. I do agree that GOT was worse, but BSG was an absolute mess. I was obsessed with that show, and I haven’t been able to rewatch a single ep since the finale. It’s been ten years. It’s a damn shame the last season ruined it for me. The beginning was so fucking good. Maybe in another ten years I’ll be able to go back and watch the first two seasons.","Yeah with BSG I could see myself watching the early seasons of it, then just stopping before it got *too* stupid. What that exact point is I'm not sure because it's been so long since I watched it, but I think I could enjoy the ride along the way again.

Game of Thrones not so much because that's a show that's really all about the resolution. If you don't tie it all together in the end, it all means nothing. Especially in this case, since D&D not only rushed it badly but also actively trashed most of the major character arcs in the end (Jamie going back to Cersei, Jon going back to the Wall, etc.) Why should anyone care about the story of these characters if they all just end up back where they started or dead for no good reason? Why should anyone care about political intrigue when Westeros basically goes back to the way it was before? Yes it's missing a kingdom and it has a new king, but the same old system is still firmly in place. It's just not interesting anymore because you know none of it matters at all.","The Halo 2 remaster cutscenes were done by Blur Studios right? Those looked pretty cool, if I'm remember correctly.","My favourite run is my latest one. As Robb working together with Tyrells (married Margaery), Greyjoys and Martells to overthrow Joffrey and split the realm (all of these got separate kingdoms after the victory)",Turncloaks.,I see you took my comment personally. It was of no offense.,Yea The Good Place is great,"It's because Michael Schur has artistic integrity, which 2D are severly lacking.","Yep. The cutscenes are great, it's just the general feel you get while actually playing on the old graphics that I prefer.","Nope, didn't take it personally.  It is fun to trash dumb people doing stupid things, but it thankfully won't happen in this case.","I'm gonna tell my kids that Breaking Bad is the best TV show ending of all time.

D&D tell us that how that happened to her, in the last second and after winning she went crazy.","Look, anyone who tried to Justify her doing that is missing the entire point. Dany wouldn’t do that. It is not inline with anyone she has ever done. 

If she had flown to the Red Keep and burned only the red keep, looking at those trapped inside as a necessary collateral damage to save the rest of the city, that would have made sense. She would not have wanted to kill innocents, but her need to kill Cersei would have been stronger. That’s a morally grey decision to make that she would still have guilt over even if she didn’t show t publicaly. It could have been framed as a warning of how you must be careful when seeking revenge against those who wronged you even if they deserved it. Other people can and will get hurt, even if you don’t mean it. 

But no, they decided that Dany was looking at the red keep, where her enemy was, and got so enraged that she snapped and burned literally everything but the red keep for half an hour at least. That she targeted specifically innocent civilians who wouldn’t have been collateral damage at all. That she even burned down her own armies (because she knew they were in that city). That the Targ genes came out or she’d always wanted to do this (although DB Weiss said she didn’t decide ahead of time to do that.) 

And that’s the bullshit. That’s what Dany fans like myself reject flat out. It’s a character assasination so vile that even non-Dany fans and moderate anti-dany fans ended up on her side.","At some point you just have to accept that Martin and 2D had no clue how to end the story, and just threw stuff together to wrap things up. The figure we see attack King's Landing might look like Daenerys, because she's portrayed by the same actress, but there's just no way to really connect it to the actual character we saw develop and grow for 65+ episodes. It's just a plot device at that point, and you can kinda go along with the story they tell, but it really doesn't stand up to any scrutiny.",Nice strawman!,"It was fOrEsHaDoWeD

(Not trying to be mean, just found it funny)","You missed the part where they used the bad writing in season 8 to make it seem like it's impossible for her to actually be bad, call you a kneeler in a subreddit all about Expressing opinions for having an opposite opinion. Then claim they don't do that and that you just hate Dany. Also the occasional calling you sexist","I see more anti-danny's saying that Dany-stands justify her actions no matter what, than Dany stands justifying her actions","This is what I’ve been saying. Most of the Dany Fans (the non extremists) stand by dany not because they defend her actions, but because they know that wasn’t the real Dany.","If Dany was so insistent on the throne, she should have murdered the Starks in episode 4. Because Dany needed to die somehow & the make the Starks victorious at the same time, she was turned into a helpless idiotic crazy lady whose impotent anger is directed at randos rather than at the people who hurt her.","I agree with you. And I am and still am supporter of the ""Mad Queen Dany"" theory that's been implied somewhat in the books. 

But the way it happened in the show was absolute idiocy. And you said it best, it would have been so easy to have her destroy the red keep with all the civilians inside just to kill cersei. That would have worked far better. But no. Everything is lazy. Her Satanic Majesty.","Dany also said many times that she is not her father;the blood of her enemies,not innocents and that she does not want to be Queen of Ashes but well nobody will talk about that.","+++++++++++all the ones

The only time she didnt feel guilt when she killed people were people who deserved it, like the slave masters that crucified children. Daenerys literally locked away her dragons, her children, because ONE of them killed ONE child. That is not a person that would take to the streets to slaughter thousands of innocents.","Well, who wasn't in that world? Thing is, everybody hase its limits. And ""Dany stan revisionists"" does not think that Daenerys overstepping hers pictured believable in s8. That's the problem.","If it's the current justice system ""that wasn't the real her"" means absolutely nothing. Her actions proved otherwise",She was their deus-ex-machina when it came to all their enemies so they could take credit later and get rid of her too. Yay sharks.

Not one. They only say that it's not fair that someone who went through all that was misused by the writers just so they had an excuse to kill her. You're making shit up.",Indeed she was.,It's called being a hypocrite.

You conveniently name every social media platform EXCEPT the one I spoke of, that just reeks of denial.","And I think that is the reason why people need a good story - because in the end, we all search for hope and happiness in the stories we read and watch. Because you don't follow your favourite characters for multiple books, seasons, hours and years just to watch them being destroyed in the last minute. The stories with ""cliche"" endings are the one that will be remembered and loved forever - because deep down you want this bastard kid to become a king, you want the guy to get the girl, you want good guys to win against all odds. If you want to see something nihilistic and hopeless you just have to turn on the news or read a history book. As it was said in the 8x06 - the stories unites people, even this travesty of the ending united us in hatered. And I guess it will be remembered but not in the way we wanted it to be. But maybe I'm just naive and haven't been paying attention.",Why would I think back at season 8?,"A story may not end the way I think it might but at least give the story a satisfying conclusion that has tied everything together since the prologue.

...^^right?",Last week it got down to 32 in houston now its back up to 75,"Those are your last words? *Fuck you?* Come on, ThisHappenedA, you can do better.","As with any major franchise, there are many viewpoints so I don’t speak for everyone. I started watching GoT about two weeks before the first episode of Season 8 aired and I wanted to catch up after years of ignoring all my friends telling me to watch GoT.

So I binge all 7 seasons and also watch the developer commentary at the end of each episode and the first four seasons are fucking amazing. I watch S5 and it’s pretty good, I’m still riding the hype train and onto S6 I’m still loving it. In S7 there are some questionable things that happen that make me think “damn, X character is LUCKY that Y character was able to do such and such for them”, among some bullshit character changes in personality (Tyrion) that basically changed who they were and watered down their personalities.

S8 was all of that and worse. I watched every episode and developer commentary as it aired to try and get a sense of anything that I may have missed. The first two or three episodes (the ones *before* the Long Night) were actually pretty good and were hyping me up for the battle with the Night King. I remember that on Reddit everyone knew the S8 would be 6 episodes and everyone was wondering how the fuck they’d fit in a battle with the Night King *and* a good battle with Cersei’s forces. 

Anyway, the Long Night episode 3 airs and by the end of it I’m like “what the fuck was this??”

The fight was not only short, the main baddy dies like a chump while Bran does nothing but sit.

After that episode I really started getting the sense that the writers of the show simply did not give a fuck anymore and were taking the shortest and laziest route to end the show and tie up as few plot lines as possible. Someone more dedicated than me can describe all those plot points but some of the bigger failings in the S8 were:

1.	The Night King’s death

2.	Dany ‘forgetting’ about the ship fleet surrounding KL

3.	Tyrion’s character degradation

4.	Jon’s indecisiveness (I dun’t wannit)

5.	Vary’s death. Could have been avoidable, IMO.

6.	Dragon death.

7.	the Dothraki being almost COMPLETELY annihilated during the Long Night but then magically being restored during the invasion of King’s Landing.

8.	the remaining influence the Unsullied has after everything was over in the last episode.

9.	Jon’s banishment to the north. In a way, it’s not the fact that he went north that bothers me, after all he may find it hard to fit in the south considering his true lineage. What bothers me is that it was done as a condition for the Unsullied to release him for what he did (and I’m surprised they were willing to release him at all considering what he did).

Unless that was his ending, he saw the response and was like “oh shit my idea sucks” and got spooked by that?",Or the “only ending” will be the trash D&D put out into the world...,most of us will spend our entire lives never contributing even 1 book,Would've been more than 4 seasons too. The 2Ds cut stuff from a story and reportedly dismissed GRRM's concerns about it while having no idea how the story was meant to end and had no vision of their own.,"Plot lines are not content. I'm well aware they didn't invent everything about the end of the series, but they also weren't adapting content the way they were earlier. 

I can imagine Dany getting ambushed by the Iron Fleet, but if she 'forgets' about them the way she did in the show, then something weird would be going on.","GRRM dropped out of the show a while ago, reportedly after an argument with the 2Ds. One of the 2Ds spoke about how they decided to have Arya kill the Nightking (because it was unexpected) in that post episode ""interview"" thing. It was definitely their idea.

The Three Eyed Raven/Bran ending up as king would be right up George's alley. The magical wizard helping humanity turning out to a ruthless entity attempting to seize power for the greater good would've a good twist if 2D didn't fuck it up.","Sure, but the hype will never be higher than it was before the show went down the shitter, and GRRM saw that one coming when he left after season... 5?

I don't think any new fans are being created now. In this case absence will not make the heart grow fonder.","Ok, but that doesn't explain how sitting on finished books makes more money than releasing them before people move on and stop caring.","The cast was quite large so that's an impressive feat, Bobby B. I don't think I would have remembered ALL of them.","I know it's a cliche at this point to say 'S E N T I E N T' but like, for real, this is the most on-point response I've ever seen from Bobby B.",Only two years have passed in the books.,"Bobby B was the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.

That, and Bran the Broken complimenting me every time I call him a useless plot filler.","On that day Alfred, you can say I told you so",At least hes not rushing it like dumb and dumber...,"> sell-pen author

Ain't that the truth. He's chasing deal after deal rather than finishing the damn book, let alone books. 

He hates criticism like this because it strikes too close to home.","> He's writing a video game

I suspect his involvement in Elden Ring has already concluded. He probably came up with a lot of the initial story and then passed it off to the FromSoft team to make into a game. 

At least that's my hope given how he's been more serious about TWOW recently.","However, he has been offered and turned down the chance to write scripts for House of the Dragon due to Winds of Winter being the priority.",At least we get a game and a prequel,That videogame will probably be a launch title for the PS6 if you are lucky it might even be on steam 2,"I’ve been following it same as you have but if you don’t believe the teasers coming out recently have been something different, I don’t think you’ve been paying attention.

I’m not expecting. I’m hoping but I’m also believing","I’ve been following it the same as you have dude, but if you don’t think the teasers recently have been a big shift in what we should expect I kinda feel like you haven’t been paying attention. It will be in his hand by August 2020.",You seriously don’t think it’ll be out in 2020? What world are you living in... I’m not saying it’s a sure thing but it’s certainly likely.,"No, as I said in a different comment I was saying before August 2020",That’s it we’re turning this wagon around,"“I'll admit, I haven't read the entire ASOIF. I read the first book, and while I though the writing was excellent (I've enjoyed a lot of George's short fiction) I found the experience too much for me. It didn't feel realistic so much as, ""Look how much I can build someone up before I destroy them."" Which is an absolute art--it's using emotion in a very powerful and clever way. But I feel that he's often doing things to shock and surprise, precisely because they'd be too pessimistic for an ordinary fantasy series. (Indeed, his series feels like distinct reaction and contrast to the cozy fantasy stories of the eighties.)” - Brandon Sanderson circa 2016

He doesn’t even like the series, there’s no way he’d finish it.",Sanderson starts a lot more stuff than he finishes.,Now this is criticism I can accept. I may be deluded but I’ve lived through the winter same as all of you,"I agree entirely. Winds of Winter, much like the show, will probably make a dream of spring feel somewhat anticlimactic. It’ll just be much, much better. So I agree that it’s probably a much more ambitious and therefore difficult book to write.",I was kind of kidding lol. I just don’t really see him on death’s doorstep or anything. He’s still a prolific content creator and seems to be working on /things/ on a regular basis. Though I am in a separate debate about Bobby B rn and though this was a comment calling Bobby B a fat old man and I was about to report your damn comment,Amen!,Yup same,"I mean, starting something and finishing it are two different things. You can start a fight with Chuck Liddell easily.  You aren't finishing it though.","You ever read a really good book? How do you start to feel when you see that you're coming to the last chapter? Personally, it bums me out, and I find myself making excuses so I don't have to finish it, and it can go on for a while longer.

I have to imagine it feels the same when anything you've lived with, and loved for a long time is coming to an end.","The back of the Game of Thrones book already has a quote that says George is the American Tolkien. That's quite possibly THE best compliment you could give George. His work was adapted into what was once up for running as the best show of all time until about the time it ran out of George's source material. 

George has all the legacy he'll ever need. He can kick back at a bar and say ""Yeah Game of Thrones tanked Lost style at the end but nobody can deny the part of it that had books to reference was tv gold"" and he'd be absolutely fucking right. He's just doing what he wants at this point. He's got ""fuck you"" kinds of money already and will forever make a decent penny off ASOIAF merch and such.  

It's the worst kept secret that he loves House Targaryen the most and boy does it show. We'll absolutely get Fire and Blood 2 before Dream of Spring (probably before Winds too), assuming he makes it to F&B2. Shit he's writing a video game right now because it's clear from his actions that he just doesn't care about finishing ASOIAF's main series.",There was that whole scene in the show where Tywin was talking about legacy to Tommen. If GRRM wrote that in the books I don't imagine he cares all that much about legacy.,"Some people care about legacy and artistic integrity, GRRM isn't one of them.","It's a question of prioritization at this point because, yes, he's still working hard. The problem is that TV writing is his passion and now he basically has his pick of an endless pool of TV projects, so ASOIF will always take a back seat to his primary passion.",It would be more like if he made *Dunk & Egg* a VR game.,"> I mean, there general quality of Feast & Dance went down compared to the initial trilogy in the first place. I may be in the minority with this opinion.

It's not a minority opinion. I'd venture a guess that most would agree. With that said, I did think that things really got interesting when he **finally** cared to advance the story in the back half of A Dance with Dragons. I was hyped and then 6-7 years passed for me...","also video games, apparently",All of those are going to be optioned for spin offs and one-off specials. I guarantee it.,Just get Sanderson to finish it but then have some edits bringing back in more gruesome variations. Still better than DnD.,"Come on dude, not even a phd thesis lasts that long",I&#39;m going to go now.,I always wanted to be a wizard.,"The book money is arbitrary at this point. The more ""franchise-able"" content he creates between now and his death is unique content that can then be optioned for TV and movies after his passing.  

Think of it this way: He can make a lot of money now by finishing up his books or he can make his estate infinite money in the future by creating either new IPs or parallel GOT content.

You could literally have someone ghost write the rest of the series after his passing and still make the same amount of book money then as he would if he finished the book series today.",YOU LET THAT LITTLE GIRL DISARM YOU?,WHY HAVE I NOT SEEN YOU? WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?,Not this time,"That makes more sense, but pretty hard to pull off in a TV show where we're inevitably going to see the actors age.","PISS ON THAT! SEND A RAVEN!

I'm sure he's sooo mad at you right now bro.,"I dont remember the source but I love From games.  GRRM was writing/wrote the world lore.

Are there teasers other than him saying if it isn't to his editor by the New Zealand con summer 2020 then they can kidnap him?",!RemindMe 9 months TWOW out,"Oh, my sweet summer child. You must be new to this fandom.


Unsarcastically asking, do you have any idea what the delays have been like between previous books? George's writing style? The compounding delay between the latest releases and the next one? I will believe this series is going to be finished when I hold all the books in my hands. Time is against GRRM and us, I'm afraid.","You kind spring infant, you cant turn wagons around.  You can only ford, take a ferry, or hire a guide.","Damn, if I needed a reason to love Sanderson more - I totally agree with this. Like I enjoy reading the books but after I binged all of them I needed to take a break from how emotionally shitty they are.","Sanderson finishing WoT made sense. The writing styles weren't entirely incompatible (largely due to the fact that he was heavily influenced by it), the endings for both Sanderson and Jordan tend to be either happy it bittersweet, and some of his character voices sounds suspiciously like the ones from WoT. Even then he got a few wrong (I'm looking at you, Mat). 

There's not an author outside of Martin that could bring anything resembling a satisfying conclusion to ASoIaF in my opinion. He's the only writer I've ever read in modern fantasy who (and this is not a criticism, I just don't know how else to phrase it) has so little regard for the lives and well-being of the characters he has written.","I mean he finished the Wheel of Time series, while it was started by Robert Jordan... who died","Except when he's writing books he pretty much stays on schedule for their release. He has an entire universe with multiple worlds and storylines going and the cosmere is far from finished but to compare him to GRRM? Laughable. 

He doesn't have a single published series that doesn't look like it'll be finished, and GRRM has a single series that will absolutely never be finished",That's how good writers work. If he never finished anything that would be a different story.,"I dint think that DOS will be anti climactic. I think at the start of DOS, the Long Night will still be in full force. 

since its a *dream* of spring. I dont think spring will actually come til more than half way through book 7. 

Also dream could point to spring never coming and its a non hollywood ending as well","No, but it will be finished lol",So Chuck Liddell needs to beat George until he finishes the books.,"Are you from 2006? Chuck Liddell moves like a geriatric now, he had a fight a while ago and looked like he had never really trained before, it was shocking, considering there's plenty of old fighters and boxers who still have a bit of pop to them","Calling him the american Tolkien is an insult to all the other writers who've told amazing expansive stories and actually finished them. Shout out and RIP to Robert Jordan.

WoT >>> GoT","And hes getting involved in the Targaryen prequel, if it gets off the ground.","Dude was on pace to be the American Tolkien, but you don't get to stand on the podium if you don't finish the race.","characters don't always carry their authors' beliefs, otherwise every character in a story would be the same. while it is possible grrm was expressing his own ideals, it's also possible that he wasnt, and that's just what tywin would say.","To be fair, Tywin also thinks mass murder at a wedding reception is totally cool so he might not be very reliable as George's mouthpiece.","Which seems crazy to me that a guy who has spent so much of his life studying history would not care about his place in the annals of time.

Edit: I wanted to say annals.","Your statement is not based in reality. GRRM admited he had a major writers block, as well dropping original 5 year jump idea had caused major rewrites.

He also stated that after Fire and Blood, he had put TWOW as his top priority.","Agreed. But, you said writing for TV is his passion. He didn't write for the HBO show, and he has continued to produce original content inside of the Planetos universe, but not the main story.

He isn't producing an entire book with the desire to ""write for tv"", even if he is it still invalidates your point that he isn't writing the last books because he wants to do TV.

He has writers block, he can't or won't finish the series. I think part of the reason to this is that all the cool, original stuff in GOT is rooted in the story not being ""good vs bad"" but, once you've got an army of bad guy zombies that goes out the window.",What’s “all of them”? He essentially only has “Fire and Blood” and “Dunk and Egg” for spinoff stories. He hasn’t written much material for spin-off series if were being honest. I do want him to expand the world as much as possible but we wan’t him to finish ASOIAF first. I think we as fans at least deserve proper closure to the story.,"Sanderson already said Martin's writing style is too different from his, and he wouldn't be able to write the ending to asoiaf.","I feel you man I just can't criticize people for failing to do things that there is no requirement to do. No one is expected to have fantasies so amazing that everyone in the world has to have a chance to taste them. 
 
Writing 1 amazing book or writing 1 amazing song is going above and beyond imo. I'm thankful for what we got. If a person happens to create amazing art their whole life that's just an even bigger miracle. I don't expect miracles though.","Why can't his estate make ""infinite money"" later if he releases the books now?","It was never my intent Bobby b, but in my defense she did end up killing the Night King (even though it made no sense).","Not me specifically lol, but he does get mad at this growing feeling in the community.","I'm not sure exactly, I imagine something less substantial than writing scripts.",Being just the right distance to benefit from however it turns out?,"Nah,  I just have renewed confidence. If you asked me a year or two ago I would’ve told you GRRM would die before the series was finished",Lol I look forward to getting buried in shit 9 months from now,Jesus the sheep in this sub. Get a new thing you’ve beaten this horse to death.,Someone gets it.,"Right? He's also finished like, multiple trilogies? He just has multiple universe storylines running at the same time","Yeah, so GRRM needs to get Chuck Liddell to finish the story.","That fight against Tito was fucking heartbreaking.

There's nothing worse than watching legends step back in and get crushed.","I'd still put my money on Liddell over the average redditor.  

You're not wrong that I am older and not into MMA.",. . . But Robert Jordan didn't finish his series.,That's what I'm saying. He probably disagrees with Tywin.,That's what I'm saying,"My statement is based on the literal laundry list of TV and movie projects he released when the GOT show finished and then ended it with basically ""Oh yeah, those books, too.""

>And me?  I’m still here, and I’m still busy.    As a producer, I’ve got five shows in development at HBO (some having nothing whatsoever to do with the world of Westeros), two at Hulu, one on the History Channel.   I’m involved with a number of feature projects, some based upon my own stories and books, some on material created by others.   There are these short films I am hoping to make, adaptations of classic stories by one of the most brilliant, quirky, and original writers our genre has ever produced.

If you don't interpret this as ""I've de-prioritized these books after everything else that interests me more"" then you don't understand context.

Remaking the last season would be insulting to the cast and crew who worked so hard on it. Signing the cast on to remake those seasons isn't going to happen.

How Star Wars Episode 9 does will be telling for how big of a backlash has on actual interest. SW fans aren't happy with The Last Jedi and the box office forecast for Ep 9 is down from the $220M opening for Last jedi.

[Deadline's predictions](https://deadline.com/2019/11/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-box-office-projection-reasons-why-1202796194/) for Rise of Skywalker's opening has this:

>When *Skywalker* reviews break should **they report that this threequel is** **course correcting the left turns that many fans griped about in Rian Johnson’s** ***Last Jedi***\*,\* word will break out like wildfire and the sky is the limit when it comes to this threequel’s opening.

The expectation here is that Lucasfilm fixed the fan complaints about Last Jedi so Rise of Skywalker will have a record breaking box office performance and as soon as word gets out, ticket sales will increase.

WarnerMedia likely would see the same possibility. Fans may say they have no interest in GoT, but as soon as positive reviews come out, then all the past is forgotten.

So, a ""course correction"" might be the concept they use, rather than a remake.",SPRING IS COMING,Closer to a Crusades flashback?,an animated version would only be creepy with all the violence and nudity.,"What insulting is how we ended up with season 8 like that. i kinda understand why some stars would reluctant to reprise their roles (Sophie, Kit), but i think majority of the cast wouldve no problem with it imho, hell some of them even had openly stated their disappointment regarding how the show ended. Beside we can always (1) change the actors, (2) kills some characters off.","I am not Christian(or muslim), but something like that, yeah.","Think animated like anime/western style animation, and not 3d animation like pixar, or Blizzard cinematics. 3d would be too expensive, and too uncanny valley.","Kit probably is the only actor at this point which would be nearly impossible to get back since the rumor is Marvel sees his character, Black Knight, as one of the main Avengers moving forward.

Using Downton Abby as an example, getting the cast back was one of the biggest problems and Dame Maggie Smith was the problem. After her role in Harry Potter, money isn't an issue and it was probably more time.

If Kit is doing MCU movies, then he'll be busy and won't be in any need to take roles for money.

Sophie has only booked a Quibi series (it's a new streaming service with short format shows, think YouTube but higher budget) in the last year.  She was asked frequently on the Dark Phoenix press tour if she would be interested in doing a spinoff/sequel and mostly said no, but once joked that she would consider it later on if she needed money.

Even if Sophie, Emilia, Peter, Maisie, Gwen, and the supporting cast all return, getting a sequel series or movie greenlit is going to require Kit.

Maisie said she wasn't interested in doing GoT without D&D because to her they are GoT. The question is how much the cast actually believes that now. Peter and Emilia have been strongly pro-D&D as well.

Reuniting in 10-20 years might be an option, but much of the crew will have retired by that time. So, what I hope is that they might come around and not require D&D's involvement and want to get the gang back together for a reunion with other key members of the production team (not Dan and David) like Bernie Caulfield.  Maisie's photos from the Season 8 premiere for Vogue includes the tidbit that she, Sophie and Kit all wanted to get a picture together with Bernie because of how much she meant to them. Maisie called her their guardian angel on the set. So, while they might like D&D, is it absolutely necessary for them to be involved for the cast to come back - because Freefolk would have a meltdown if D&D were involved in some sort of spinoff.

The big question is who would replace D&D. There would need to be director and writer(s) the cast and HBO trusts. If the House of the Dragon turns out well, maybe that might be Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik.

> In Alfred Hitchcock's world, blonde women were overwhelmingly rich, entitled, and cold. But for a stretch during the late '80s and early '90s, they were rich, entitled, cold, and struggling with fertility issues. 

> Even Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, the Avenger who started out as an anti-hero, declared herself to be ""a monster"" in reference to the sterilization treatments she was forced to endure. From Mad Max: Fury Road to even Juno, women are often divided into ""breeders"" and ""the barren,"" with the latter coming off as cool and distant at best, and malicious and desperate at worst. Dividing women into these two camps isn't merely limiting: The tradition is downright medieval.

>Half a millennium later, we still haven't fully rejected these backward attitudes. It's not that fertility issues shouldn't be addressed in film and on TV — it's important that they are. It's that it's unproductive, shaming, and stereotype-perpetuating to align fertility and motherhood with virtue, and infertility with villainy, when real life shows us that that's not the case.

This is what David and Dan have given him to act Jon on.","He doesn’t even mention his sisters at all. Instead, in a brief 30 second conversation before deciding to kill her, he asks her for THE ONE THING HE KNOWS FULL WELL SHE CAN’T AGREE TO. He asks her to forgive Tyrion, after he watched Tyrion commit treason and disrespect Dany right in front of both of her armies. No ruler could show leniency after that, if they wanted to continue being a leader. Jon himself had to follow through with executing Janos even when he was begging forgiveness and promising to follow orders, because to not follow through at that point would have undermined his authority. 

So Jon goes in there, knowing full well pardoning Tyrion is the one thing she can’t do. He could have, if he wanted to see if she could be reasoned with or was too far gone, brought up Sansa instead. “Your Grace, my sister and the North have suffered so much. Sansa only wants to protect her people. After everything the North has given, won’t you consider granting them Independence? They don’t contribute much to the other kingdoms, anyway, and they came to help you win the throne. Will you consider it?” 

No, he goes right to asking about Tyrion, knowing she’ll say no, and then it’s an immediate trip to Stabby Town. 

They can keep that bullshit about him not deciding until right before it happened. He went in there with his mind made up.","> It would have made this shit episode much better if Sansa/Arya really was in some conceivable danger from Dany. 

I agree. Too much of what is going on is simply implied.  If the audience is like Emilia and doesn't see that coming, then how are they going to understand what happened?

I suspect the problem is D&D didn't want to give away too much because the writing would be on the wall. If Dany decrees all the high lords and ladies need to come and kneel, then Sansa and Arya won't, then they're going to die.

Script says its not about Tyrion but his sisters, and also anyone else who stands in her way. And I know you hate and  probably dont accept what Dany did  - but  for whatever reason she did burn  alive a million residents of Kings Landing - its terrifying even if you know who she was the was before. Anyway it was shit because it was so horribly written.

But here is the script and D&D's explanations in the notes that dont come out so well in the dialogue  or their direction [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/420666514971033621/606860946689753099/Game\_of\_Thrones\_-\_Ep\_806\_-\_The\_Iron\_Throne\_.pdf](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/420666514971033621/606860946689753099/Game_of_Thrones_-_Ep_806_-_The_Iron_Throne_.pdf)","> Jon himself had to follow through with executing Janos even when he was begging forgiveness and promising to follow orders, because to not follow through at that point would have undermined his authority.

This is not the same case at all. **At all**. Jon was a newly elected leader that only won by a margin of **1 vote**. Sending Janos to wherever he sent him to was his **first** official order as a leader. His control of the watch was flimsy at best. 54% of the Watch hated him and hated the idea of him being a leader. And Janos refusing his order isn't just embarrassing or disrespectful it is undermining his whole short rule. If Janos can get away with it, it shows what kind of leader Jon is. And if he shows mercy to Janos, he's a weak leader.

Dany on the other hand had the full respect of her army. The Dothraki and Unsullied are 100% loyal to her. And after what she did in KL they are even more loyal. Forgiving(AKA not executing) Tyrion wouldn't have put a scratch in her army's confidence in her.

In this case if Jon forgives Janos, it's obvious that he forgives because he's weak, he doesn't have what it takes, and he shouldn't be respected. If Dany forgives, it's because she has chosen to be merciful instead of vengeful. She doesn't need to prove anything to her army. They are behind her no matter what she does to Tyrion.",">I agree. Too much of what is going on is simply implied. If the audience is like Emilia and doesn't see that coming, then how are they going to understand what happened?

I'm not sure how Emilia could not see it coming. It was obvious she will be killed by someone after the bells triggered Dany... Maybe she means that she didn't see it coming that Jon would do it... Though this is strange too, as Jon's moral compass seems to be squarely against mass murder. But given how character motivations are treated in season 8, there really is no knowing...

> If Dany decrees all the high lords and ladies need to come and kneel, then Sansa and Arya won't, then they're going to die.

This what they needed to do. Exactly.",">I suspect the problem is D&D didn't want to give away too much because the writing would be on the wall. If Dany decrees all the high lords and ladies need to come and kneel, then Sansa and Arya won't, then they're going to die.

Sansa and Arya weren't the head of their family. No one would normally require that the lord paramount younger sisters swear fealty to the. If this was a real issue, Dany would have had them bend the knee while she was in Winterfell. The real problem was that Sansa had already tried to stage a coup. They had her do that to drive the plot while trying to act like she was innocent. That's why D&D tried to spin the Tyrion scene as if she didn't tell him Jon's secret.

All of this nonsense had to be implied because if you really get down to it, Jon was supposedly protecting his sisters from the consequences of committing a crime and/or breaking faith with the queen. The plot relied on the audience just going along with the double standard they were setting up. Arya would obviously kill someone that didn't kneel to Jon. She was even considering killing her own sister in season 7. Sansa wanted to punish children for their parents crimes. Jon would executed lords that didn't bend the knee to him. If Jon was being written with logic in mind, he would have actually dealt with his sisters instead of killing Dany. Think about that justification for a second. Your sisters might commit treason or murder and instead of dealing with them, you kill their target instead. They couldn't make things clear because it would have highlighter their shitty writing.

>But if faced with Torrhen Stark's choice, would Sansa kneel to save her people from death and destruction?

The problem with that is that Sansa wasn't the queen in the north. She didn't really have any people. At least none that really mattered. Jon was king in the north when he knelt. He was responsible for making sure his people kept faith with the queen. Torrhen Stark also had lords and family members that didn't like that he had bent the knee. The difference was that he actually dealt with them like an actual leader instead walking around like a sad puppy.

>Probably.

This is the other problem. The Sansa from season 6-8 was stubborn to the point of seeming suicidal. That's part of the reason they just kept implying she wouldn't kneel. It would have been maid painfully obvious how stupid they made the characters if they actually had to deal with the consequence of their actions. Instead we just get a bunch of silly implications that don't really make sense. D&D had a similar problem with the battle of the bastards. Jon's plan for defeating Ramsey makes absolutely no sense. They had less than half of the men that Ramsey did and their enemy had much better position than them. Jon's plan playing out would have looked silly.

>So, there's needs to be more of a threat that Dany is going to kill far more people and burn Westeros to the ground.

A threat she delivered in languages that Tyrion and Jon don't speak.","Yes, a good chunk of the fandom not only wanted Dany to be a villain but an ineffectual villain who is not a real threat to hurt their faves and who is easily defeated. Dany might have the highest kill count but out of all the 'villains' in the series she is the lamest one when it comes to killing important and/or named characters","I don't think Dany necessarily needed to be evil. I think there's a distinction between a revolutionary and a tyrant.

While GoT has ""evil"" characters like Joffrey and Ramsay, at least there's some explanation about why those characters are the way they are (Joff being bullied by Bobby B wasn't shows as much as it should have been).

Most characters on the show do evil things because they think they are right - like Stannis burning Shireen.

Showing that Dany believes she's right and that she's doing things necessary to make the world a better place (according to her) is far more interesting to watch then having her be  a supervillain out to conquer the world.

The show never explains why Dany wants what she wants or why what she wants is wrong. She goes on and on about breaking the wheel, which sound good but what does that mean? Likely it's destroying the Great Houses of Westeros so they can never threaten her family again and she can finally feel safe.  But she can rationalize that she's doing it to save the common folks whose lives are destroyed by Great Houses fighting over petty squabbles.

If Dany wants a very strong absolute monarchy where she breaks the Great Houses and forces them to bend to her will, then historically that is something that does bring peace and prosperity.  Even today, toppling tyrants destabilizes countries and causes chaos. 

But with an incredibly strong absolute monarch, that's something the Great Houses would oppose. It's not making Dany evil, but it's something that would bring the characters into conflict.

But that's never explained and too many fans assume everything Dany says means she's the most benevolent queen that's never lived - not that what she's saying means potential death and destruction for Westeros.",">Why are the explainations to make the show better always about ""why not make Dany more evil""

They aren't. Her being a clear danger to Arya or Sansa is not 'more evil' than killing 500k people. But in this instance it will motivate the characters to a more plausible course of action. After Dany killed the people in KL Jon doesn't have an immediate call to action to kill her. No one's life is really at stake if he doesn't kill her right now. He could have killed her later, or he could have seen how she acted. Perhaps she could be saved. Given the fact that Jon wasn't really happy about the idea of killing her in the first place, it isn't clear why it was so urgent to do it now.

If Dany is posing a clear and imminent danger to Sansa and Arya. (Or even other people) Then it explains the immediacy of Jon's decision. Making the story more coherent.

TL:DR
I'm sure you'll ignore everything I said and just say it's because ""Men can't handle it when women are in charge this is why they hate Dany and want her to die."" (Even though I bet on Dany before season 8 aired and my vote is registerd on /r/DaenerysWinsTheThrone)","If I look back, I am lost.","I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria, and I will take what is mine! With fire and blood I will take it.","To be honest it is one of the biggest problems - that you have to read a script to get to know characters motivations. As a viewer you shouldn't have do it, it should be shown on the screen, explained in the dialogues. They wanted actors to show all this emotions, thoughts and dillemas in a single look and facial expression and they were sure that the audience will get it. It is not how story telling in a TV show should work.","> This is not the same case at all. **At all**. Jon was a newly elected leader that only won by a margin of **1 vote**. Sending Janos to wherever he sent him to was his **first** official order as a leader. His control of the watch was flimsy at best. 54% of the Watch hated him and hated the idea of him being a leader. And Janos refusing his order isn't just embarrassing or disrespectful it is undermining his whole short rule. If Janos can get away with it, it shows what kind of leader Jon is. And if he shows mercy to Janos, he's a weak leader. 

Jon was clearly happy to kill him. Janos had been making a point of giving him shit for weeks and fucked around a gave him an excuse. Not that that really matters. He would have been right to execute him no matter the circumstances. The number of votes and how long he would have been in charge didn't matter. Ned didn't need to kill that kid because of the state of his leadership. It was his duty.

I also find it funny that you're putting emphasis on it being his first order. The first thing Tyrion is seen doing when she takes the capital is quitting in a massively disrespectful fashion. You don't think it would affect the way her men see her if she just let him get away with that?

>Dany on the other hand had the full respect of her army. The Dothraki and Unsullied are 100% loyal to her. And after what she did in KL they are even more loyal. Forgiving(AKA not executing) Tyrion wouldn't have put a scratch in her army's confidence in her.

What about the Dothraki would make you think they would overlook her letting Tyrion live? This is another issue with the show's writing. They never went into the Dothraki's opinions on anything so people act like they'r robots. They're supposed to respect strength.  Dany managed to almost lose a war against someone much weaker than her because she listened to Tyrion. Do they care or even know about that? Were all of them down with following her after she followed the Khals. They've made a huge societal change. Do any of them have an opinion on that? Did they even know what Tyrion did? Dany arrived in Westeros with a huge army and her pussy footing around got a bunch of her men killed. Do any of them care? The unsullied and Dothraki aren't automatons. 

> If Dany forgives, it's because she has chosen to be merciful instead of vengeful.   
>  
>She doesn't need to prove anything to her army. They are behind her no matter what she does to Tyrion. 

The double standard here is strong. Why is it considered being vengeful when Dany kills someone for breaking the law but not when Jon does it? Is Tyrion supposed to get a free pass for breaking the law or something? He had just committed treason by letting his brother go. I don't mean that he committed treason in the way it might be used in modern day politics. He committed the legal definition of treason. 

 ***Treason*** *against the* ***United States****, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort.* 

What Tyrion did could still get him killed in more than a few first world counties. He let their enemies main general go so that he could help their enemy escape.

We were just supposed to support Tyrion getting a pass for his idiocy because we we're supposed to like him. Janos was an over the top asshole so we cheered his execution on. That's hack story telling. Tyrion was my favorite character until season 5. He clearly deserved to die.",Yep and that's why her villain arc falls completely flat even if you ignore the awful set up for it. She wasn't a villain for any reason besides shock value and getting her out of the way in a guilt free way for other characters to take power she earned. If there were actual story reasons for her as a villain then she would have killed someone relevant and Jon and Tyrion wouldn't have survived murdering her by the show literally ignoring logic and pretending like it isn't.,"> Dany might have the highest kill count but out of all the 'villains' in the series she is the lamest one when it comes to killing important and/or named characters

Exactly, and even when those important/named characters are the reason she is suffering. If there's an example of mockery of female rage & agency, that's here. For some reason, Dany is extremely evil but doesn't hurt any of the characters actually bent on destroying her, because they are mains. Imagine a character of her stature reduced to turning a villain in the last 5 minutes of the story, while at the same time being a pathetic mess and being killed 2 minutes after.","I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria, and I will take what is mine! With fire and blood I will take it.",BACKSTABBING DOESN'T PREPARE YOU FOR A FIGHT!,">The show never explains why Dany wants what she wants or why what she wants is wrong. She goes on and on about breaking the wheel, which sound good but what does that mean? 

They most likely wrote that scene because she instituted more democratic leaning forms of governments in the cities she conquered. She likely would have instituted pro small folk reforms similar to what Aegon V wanted to do. They both identified with the small folk more than the nobles due to the way they grew up.

>Likely it's destroying the Great Houses of Westeros so they can never threaten her family again 

What family? She thought she was the only one left and assumed she couldn't have kids.

>and she can finally feel safe. 

She definitely wouldn't have been safer if she pushed for pro small folk reforms. Aegon V only sort of got away with pushing his reforms because the lords could easily ignore them.

> But she can rationalize that she's doing it to save the common folks whose lives are destroyed by Great Houses fighting over petty squabbles.

What made you think she was just rationalizing her actions?","Oh for fucks sake, don't go on justifying massacring thousands for the throne just because you refuse to accept that Asoiaf-endgame is a lame history of Hitler vs good guys lol.","> After Dany killed the people in KL Jon doesn't have an immediate call to action to kill her. No one's life is really at stake if he doesn't kill her right now. He could have killed her later, or he could have seen how she acted. Perhaps she could be saved. Given the fact that Jon wasn't really happy about the idea of killing her in the first place, it isn't clear why it was so urgent to do it now.

>If Dany is posing a clear and imminent danger to Sansa and Arya. (Or even other people) Then it explains the immediacy of Jon's decision. Making the story more coherent.

No, it doesn't. It just makes the story a teeny-tiny bit less black & white (although that's impossible since the writer just decided to make one side massacre hundreds of thousands). Jon's decision to kill her wasn't based on her massacring KL, just like Tyrion's wasn't based on her massacring KL as well. Both knew what was about to happen (although they hadn't gauged it would be unnecessary) & let it happen. Tyrion turned against Dany after seeing the dead bodies of Jaime & Cersei (hence the extended chest-beating scene of Tyrion over their dead bodies), and Jon turned against Dany after he realizes maybe he won't always have a sway over her. His thought is -if she can execute Tyrion for betraying her, then she will execute  Sansa/Arya for betrayal as well.",">The number of votes and how long he would have been in charge didn't matter.

You are delusional if you think a person who almost has a mutiny on his hands is in as much of a dire need to prove himself to his men as someone who has the complete loyalty of his men.

> What about the Dothraki would make you think they would overlook her letting Tyrion live?

They just watched her fry an entire city. Killing or sparing Tyrin don't really mean anything in the face of that.

>Why is it considered being vengeful when Dany kills someone for breaking the law but not when Jon does it?

Because she doesn't have to. That's the point. Jon didn't have any choice. He had to kill Janos to keep his command. Just as Theon had to kill the Stark Arm's master to keep the loyalty of his men. If Dany executes someone it's her will. She doesn't have to prove anything to anyone because she isn't in a state where her control over her armies or people is flimsy.

>Is Tyrion supposed to get a free pass for breaking the law or something? He had just committed treason by letting his brother go. 

This is not the point. The point is that Dany doesn't have to execute him to appease her army. This is what you stated before. That her army won't be loyal if Tyrion lives. This isn't true. Dany can do whatever she wants with Tyrion and her army will still be loyal.","That's why Tyrion's survival annoys me. He should have been executed the moment he threw down his pin and disrespected her in front of her army. When the last time Daenerys did not immediately execute a traitor? And plus she a villainous Mad Queen Tyrant who systematically mows down civilians for an hour, so her not immediately offing him is not consistent.",">You are delusional if you think a person who almost has a mutiny on his hands is in as much of a dire need to prove himself to his men as someone who has the complete loyalty of his men.

When I say doesn't matter. I mean in outcome. Jeor Mormont would have also killed Janos. If anything, Jon's decision put him at risk. If half of the watch dislikes you, an execution form those ranks might push the mutiny over the edge. That why Janos had a second of hope when Alliser cut Jon off. Janos generally being a dickhead and a coward might have saved that situation.

How does Jon killing Janos prove that he has the complete loyalty of his men anyway? That's not the point of a move like that.

>They just watched her fry an entire city. Killing or sparing Tyrin don't really mean anything in the face of that.

Playing favorites with someone that just betrayed her wouldn't mean anything? Her killing hundreds of thousand of innocents while sparing a clearly guilty person would logically have some affect on how people saw her.

>Because she doesn't have to. That's the point.

Having to or not isn't the defining factor in something being vengeful.

>Jon didn't have any choice. He had to kill Janos to keep his command. Just as Theon had to kill the Stark Arm's master to keep the loyalty of his men. If Dany executes someone it's her will.

For one, you're assuming she didn't have to based on us not getting explicit scenes with her soldiers like Jon and Theon had with theirs. She didn't even interact with them. You're also doing that while ignoring that she was having clear issues with Varys and Tyrion.

You're also conflating it being necessary to keep control of a specific situation and it generally being necessary. Was it vengeance when Ned Stark killed the nights watch deserter? When Robb executed his men for killing the Lannister kids? How about when Jon killed the men that murdered him? He gave up his position immediately using the power it gave him to execute them.

>She doesn't have to prove anything to anyone because she isn't in a state where her control over her armies or people is flimsy

What are you talking about? She was openly disrespected in The North by her subjects and vassals. Her spy master had just tried to replace her with Jon. He also tried to murder her. He got the idea to do that when Sansa tried to stage the world's silliest coup. Dany's second in command had just committed treason. Her control over her people and armies wasn't flimsy? Janos Slynt only told Jon to fuck off when he was given an order. Tyrion let her prisoner go so he could help her enemy escape.

You're having to ignore anyone that's not unsullied or Dothraki to make this claim. She would have needed to secure the fealty of all of the other kingdoms after taking the capital. Why would anyone respect her when she let her own hand get away with treason.

>This is not the point. The point is that Dany doesn't have to execute him to appease her army. This is what you stated before. That her army won't be loyal if Tyrion lives. This isn't true. **Dany can do whatever she wants with Tyrion and her army will still be loyal.**

What are you basing this assertion on? What about the Dothraki would lead you to believe that they would overlook such a clear display of weakness. She gained control of them when she killed all of their leaders. You don't think her letting her second in command get away with a capital offence would matter at all?","Tyrion & all the Starks. Why would she forgive Sansa? And you are telling me that the lady who locked her dragons, her children, to avoid the deaths of children has gone so evil as to kill children, but  for some reason she can't kill the family who betrayed her?","> Jeor Mormont would have also killed Janos

He wouldn't. That's the whole point. Janos defied Jon because he didn't respect his authority. He thought the other people who don't support Jon as the leader would help him get out of it. (Especially Ser Alliser.) The whole reason why Janos disobeyed Jon is because Jon's authority is flimsy. BTW if you remember, Jeor should have hanged Jon for fighting with Alister, but he didn't.

Tyrion defied Dany not because he doesn't respect her authority. He defied her because he doesn't agree with the way she rules or the things she had done. 

>Was it vengeance when Ned Stark killed the nights watch deserter? When Robb executed his men for killing the Lannister kids?

You are moving the goal post. You claimed that Dany have to kill tyrion strictly because if she doesn't her army will lose their respect of her. This is not the case. Now you talk about other instances of execution that has nothing to do with this. You want to claim it Dany's 'duty' to kill Tyrion as it is Ned's duty to kill the deserter? That's a different argument that saying if she doesn't kill tyrion, her army will stop respecting her.",Dany having a violent rampage at Winterfell  and the Northerners would have made way more sense than her mowing down the people of King's Landing.,">He wouldn't. That's the whole point. Janos defied Jon because he didn't respect his authority.

Is your argument that he wouldn't kill him because Janos wouldn't have disobeyed the order? What kind of response is that? No shit. That's not the point. Anyone that was leading the Nights Watch would have killed Janos Slynt for what he did.

>BTW if you remember, Jeor should have hanged Jon for fighting with Alister, but he didn't.

When did he say that fighting with Aliser was punishable by hanging?

>Tyrion defied Dany not because he doesn't respect her authority. He defied her because he doesn't agree with the way she rules or the things she had done.

Do you think the reason behind the defiance is relevant? Jon and Dany wouldn't have been executing Tyrion or Janos to make a point to them. The point of executing someone under those circumstances is to make it clear that their actions are unacceptable. People are going to

You're also showing your bias by cleaning up Tyrions motives. He didn't free Jamie because he disagreed with the way Dany ruler or the things she had done. His brother was going to be executed and he wanted to save him.

>You are moving the goal post. You claimed that Dany have to kill tyrion strictly because if she doesn't her army will lose their respect of her. This is not the case.

I said above why leaving Tyrion alive would cause her to lose respect with the Dothraki and her westerosi allies. Your just keep claiming otherwise without bothering to make an actual argument. I'll ask again, why would Dothraki(or anyone) overlook that she left a traitor alive? Think about what you're claiming for minute. Lets say someone else commits treason. Does she execute them? If so, do you not see how Tyrion(her former) hand still being alive would delegitimize her position?

If you can't actually come up with a reason why killing Tyrion won't affect her standing with her armies, you're probably wrong. 

>Now you talk about other instances of execution that has nothing to do with this.

I'm trying to figure out what you consider vengeance.","But we can't have that, can we? Because then Martin can't give his favorite characters a happy ending.

More importantly, Tormund led the raid on an innocent village and Jon got chummy with him. I’d be completely betrayed too. Jon hates people who once did bad things remember? Like Theon. Only reason he didn’t kill him was because he saved his sister. 

But maybe Jon didn’t know Tormund led the raid on Olly’s village. Maybe Jon thought it was enough to say a few cliched leadership words about unity sometimes. 

He was wrong tho","I agree with you, but Jon felt sorry for hanging Olly and he certainly did not want to do it.",*nods*,Betrayal can never be forgiven jondur...,"He felt *sorry*?

People seem to have issues understanding that while while as the audience see and understand everything and have the luxury of seeing the bigger picture,the characters within the show do not.

Unless Jon explains to the Night’s Watch what would happen adequately to the character if they left the Wildings on the other side of the wall,they can’t really understand can they?

All Jon did in order to explain the threat and danger of leaving the Wildlings to their own devices was useless vague phrases and abstractions that didn’t fully emphasize the danger to everyone.","No, beheading seems more appropriate.","Again why kill him at all?

He’s a boy that took action based on his emotions and not understanding Jon’s decision because fucking Jon didn’t deign to explain it to him properly.","In westeros criminals normally is sent to the nights watch, as Olly already was at the nights watch where else could he be sent. Whether you like it or not Jon was Lord Commander of the nights watch and the men of the nights watch are supposed to obey. Whether Jon Snow chose or neglected to explain his reasons for leading the wildlings south shouldn't have been any concern of the traitors. Besides every single man at the nights watch should take the army of the dead serious after what they saw at the ranging north and at hardhome. They should know as well that every wildling killed would be another piece of meat for the army of the dead.","But that doesn’t matter. Normal people don’t just go ahead and kill someone. Jon is the Lord Commander after all. Olly stabbed him, what would you have wanted Jon to do? Things don’t work like that, not today and not in Westeros.","I accept the legal argument.

But by this logic,shouldn’t Jon have been killed several times over at this point already.

Like when he murdered the Queen he was sworn to for instance?

Regicide is instant execution.

Different factors go into these things,legally should Olly have been hung?Yes,the law is the law and on the wall the Lord Commander is the law.

Should Olly have been hung morally,that’s where I disagree.

As for the other cunts,they should have been impaled on spikes and left to die and bleed out in the cold.","Olly was by no means a normal person at this point,often times people can’t be normal when their parents get killed in front of them and cannibalised at such a young age along with the entirety of the village.

I wasn’t implying that Jon let him take his leave,just not hang him along with the real traitors who manipulated the emotions of a boy and scarred behind belief.

I’m curious about something though,do you believe that Jon should have been killed in the season finale by the Unsullied or Drogon?","I can sympathize with Olly and his actions to a certain extent, Jon made a fuck up by not by not including everyone in his plans (although they were pretty obvious) and Olly acted on emotion where he should've thought of Jon's reasons for his actions. 

It all comes down to the writing as well, in the books there isn't even an Olly character at the wall. The reason for Jon's murder is that he plans on taking Stannis' legitimization and lead an army of wildlings south to aid Stannis at winterfell thereby forsaking his nights watch vow. I don't say the show version was badly written, but it was very convenient that Jon didn't tell his reasons for what he did.

As for Jon killing Daenerys, I cant discuss that disaster duo to how badly it was written.","I get what you mean, it’s just that murder is murder for me. 

I feel sorry for Olly. But killing your Commander isn’t something that should go unpunished imo.

The whole idea of ""Daenerys going crazy"" is absolutely stupidity.

First. Let us try to imagine this final for someone else. Like Tywin for example. So Tywin almost wins the GoT but just in the end he goes crazy as a result of his megalomania obsession about the future of the dynasty and so on. Can you imagine this? I can not. It sounds ... stupid. May be Tywin is very specific character. Let's try another one ... lord Baelish. So Baelish almost wins the game but just in the end when he is finally defeated every enemy he just goes mad because of his long life throne obsession. No. That is also very stupid. Let's admit it. The whole idea of ""Daenerys going crazy"" exists only because she has dragons. And you expect something extraordinary to happen because of the them. If Daenerys didn't have dragons no one would even think about going crazy. Just like no one expects such a thing for any other character. But in this very moment you have to realize also the stupidity of the idea. OK, you expect something extraordinary because of the dragons. But what is the connection between them and going crazy? May be you have to be crazy to control dragons or if you control them for too long you will go crazy? Everything which is shown in the books looks real (if you exclude the magic stuff) and you can see in the history many things who resemble almost everything. But what resembles... this. Which english or french or whatever king/queen went crazy because of the throne obsession. No one. There are crazy monarchs but they were crazy from their childhood. I can say a monarch who went crazy after becoming an emperor - Caligula. But he didn't become crazy because of the death of Missandei or some signs or anything. He just went crazy without reason. And you cannot resolve the end of your story in such a way. It is like to kill ... Stannis because of the heart attack. Sorry Stannis. Just bad luck. You would have won the game if your heart was a bit stronger. It happens sometimes.

Second. Let's forget the stuff above. Let's imagine that we really want Daenerys to go crazy/to proove that she is not the rightful queen. And we want to put some ""signs"" about that. Forget how stupid the whole idea is and try to think what HAVE to be the signs. After all there are so many people who are just saying that the idea is not bad but the execution was bad and Martin will do it in the right way. OK. Signs. Well, here are your signs:

1. Daenerys kills/tries to kill Gendry Baratheon. Remember how obsessed was Robert about killing the Targaryens? And he wasn't even mad. He was just unworthy for the throne.
2. Daenerys kills Jaime Lannister. Probably in the moment he enters Winterfell and says that Cercei lied. Remeber Jaime is one of the most hated and despised people in Westeros. Ask lord Karstark if you doubt it. So Daenetys can kill Jaime with an ease.
3. Jon goes to Daenerys to tell her about the army of the dead. But Daenerys is ""throne obsessed"" and she has no time for stupid shits. She ignores him and his words because she has some business with Cersei i. e. getting her birthright. She is just playing the Game. Just like every other lord in Westeros by the way except for Stannis who went to the wall. Because it was his duty as a king.
4. Daenerys can not take anymore after Jon reveals his secret to her. She is full of jealous and kills him (or just lets to be killed) soon after that. Not making him swear to not reveal the secret to anyone. (That is something natural. It will causes only problems.) So she kills him without a doubt about it. Without regreting.

These can be really signs that Daenerys is ... well, not going crazy (again it is very stupid idea) but just... not the right answer for sure. But you know what? Actually Daenerys did absolutely the opposite in all the cases. She didn't kill Gendry. She made him a lord. She didn't kill Jaime at Winterfell (it was her decision, not to Brienne. Remeber lord Stark was very much against sending killers to Daenerys but Robert was the king and he decided otherwise). She didn't ignore the words of the strange person from the North who didn't even bend the knee. She stopped playing any games till saving Westeros from the dead. And she saved Jon in the battle. She didn't kill him.

So what signs you expect. There are no signs and there won't be any signs in the books too. I don't think that Daenerys will do the opposite in the books for these cases. And because the real situations (which could be converted into real sings of ... throne obsession) were followed by entirely different kind of Daenerys's behaviour, that is the reason why you are trying to find signs in ridiculous situations where cannot exist any signs. Like ""when her brother was murdered she looked like she will go crazy after no more then 70 episodes"". Yes. And why the hell she named one of her dragons Viserion? May be this is some strange sense of humor or she wanted to humiliated the memory of her brother or what?

Third. Forget about the stuff above. Let's imagine that you really want to show how destructive is the throne obsession (every obsession). This is actually very simple and still interesting to the public. Cut off Daenerys. Cut off her entirely from the story. Cut off Essos. Cut off the wall, the wildlings, the black brothers, Jon and Bran. Cut off all of them. Now you have the 7 kingdoms. This is far enough for the idea. And you have Cersei. Cersei is the ideal candidate. She is born as the daughter of one of the richest and most powerful lords in Westeros. Incredibly beautiful. Married for the king. Three children. Her house has many capable members like Kevan, Jaime, Tirion and so on. What could go wrong ... But it goes wrong. I see in Martin's end Cersei as the main reason for the full destruction of house Lannisters. You are looking for signs? May be you are looking at the wrong places. It is full of signs ... for Cersei. The whole 4th book is a big sign of the throne obsession of Cersei. And the result of this obsession. I mean real signs not idiotic interpretations.

In conclusion. Daenerys was never throne obsessed. Yes she is the rightful heir on the iron throne. That is a fact. It doesn't make her throne obsessed. The obsessed people have very different kind of behaviour. A throne obsessed person would never stay in Meereen. She becomes queen of Meereen not because of her birthright you understand that! It was her duty to stay in Meereen and to guarantee that when she finally leaves the city no one will suffer. And also because of ""I am the queen of Westeros but what exactly means that. May be first I have to stay in Meereen and learn what is the meaning of being a queen"". Where is the madness or the throne obsession? And why she even freed the slaves in Astapor? ""Why the kings or queens even exist if not to help the weak and innocent people"". Again, why she stopped the war with Cersei and came north. No one in the entire south lords (except Stannis) did that. Including book Tirion, book Tywin, book Doran, book high sparrow, book lord Royce, Rob Stark, master Luwin, masters of the citadel, lord Tarly, lord Tyrel and so on. Because she was never throne obsessed. To want something doesn't make you obsessed. (By the way Jon also wants to be a lord in the books) Daenerys is just like Jon. Just putted in different place with different people. ASOIAF. The ice and the fire are actually the same. It is not ""they have some similarities but the ice/fire is better anyway"". The problems was never in Daenerys or in Jon (you see that DnD!). The problem was in the rest of Westeros. In Sansa, Varys, Tirion, the Snakes, Cersei, Tyrels ...The list is very long. No one from Daenerys and Jon will be the final vilain. And yet one of them has to die ...","We are just going to bicker about the black and white and shades of grey in her character until the end of time. 

She ruled harshly, there were the master’s she crucified and she tried to free slaves and rule justly.

She burnt the Tarleys and locked away her dragons for killing a kid. 

I personally could never see her killing everyone at KL after just saving everyone at Winterfell. That and many other things soured the ending for me irreparably but... 

I don’t get to choose.","She isn't mad, she never was. She's just an overly entitled woman who had to deal with the ultimate rejection of realising her life goal was for nothing.","I wouldn't say it was 40 plus episodes. Dany in the early seasons was an antihero that did evil things to those she viewed, and we as viewers were led to believe, were evil.  Her big moment at the start involved burning someone at the stake.  The problem is that Dany in the middle seasons kinda forgot that she is the type of person that buries folks alive.  That character could snap and turn into a monster.",Thank you to understand everything,Crucifying slave masters isn’t ruling harshly. That’s the kindest thing you can do as a ruler.,"What do we call a woman willing to lead all of Westeros into civil war because she can't accept a more beautiful woman ruling over her? I think entitled is the word for it.

Difference is Dany spent years doing something from which she had no hopes of gaining anything, just protecting the weak.","She is the last targeryan and mother of dragons, not a random peasant. Ofcourse she is going to be entitled. According to your logic every ruler is entitled because they try to win the throne based on their birthright.",Dany was never antihero neither in book and neither show,">doing something from which she had no hopes of gaining anything, just protecting the weak.

Please, please tell me you're joking.   
Daenerys sacked Meereen because she needed resources to start a war in Westeros. 

She bought the unsullied not because she cared about them, but because she needed soldiers.",">She is the last targeryan

And? 

> mother of dragons, not a random peasant 

And???

>According to your logic every ruler is entitled because they try to win the throne based on their birthright 

Pretty much. Most of the characters on GOT are overly entitled nobles, I thought that much was obvious. From Tyrion to Jon Snow, Daenerys to Cersei, Jaime to Sansa.","She tortured way too many people to be a straight up hero.  And it wasn't a one off thing, it was a consistent part of her character.  That puts her in the territory of folks like The Punisher and Jack Bauer.  Even if you want to say that was ok, the first truly evil thing she has done in the books is torture the wineseller's children",So you haven't watched the show or read the books..perfect.,Lmao isn't jack bauer a hero?

So I binge-watched nature docs on Youtube recently and lions and wolves are fascinating af:

Lionesses are the hunters and are very protective and motherly of their children.  They sleep with multiple men in order to confuse the parentage of their children because male lions will commit infanticide on cubs that are not their own.  Gods are male lions strong!  But they are fat and slow.  Their main job is to protect their pride from other male-lion challengers.  They eat the meat of the food that their harem hunts and the rest of the pride only gets scraps - but the family puts up with it because it is ""all for the sake of protecting their family.""

It is not uncommon for growing lion cubs to begin to also start stealing the food that their mothers hunted for them.  As male cubs grow up, they are unleashed into the wild whilst the females stay in the pride.  These male lions may one day return to challenge their own fathers for their territory.

Wolves are a more cohesive family unit.  They hunt together and the fathers are involved in the upbringing of the cubs.  The mothers are also very protective of their children.  In the one documentary I was watching, the pack-leader father was willing to adopt stray cubs but the mother wanted no part in it.  Which is what really sparked me into posting this.  But I haven't finished the wolf documentary and I am getting lazy so something, something, Stark analogy.

Wolf doc: ""Living with Wolves"" from SaveOnWildLife

Lion docs: ""Wildlife in Serengeti"" by Earth Planet, ""Heart of Okavango: Pride of Lions"" and ""Lions of Etosha"" by Real Wild, ""Mapogo Male Lion Coalition"" by The Mapogos","Ugh.  Watching clips of 2D's quote re ep 6 -""this is where it all came together and where it all falls apart.""

If we're sticking to the family theme.  This quote REALLY only applies to the Starks (we saw them as a family in the beginning and in the end -they are separated.)

Or it could even be sorta used to apply to  the Lannisters (But-Jaime and Cersei are first seen together at the start of the story-And in the end-they are still together?)

This quote doesn't really apply to the Targs?  They were both separated in the beginning.

I can't even make sense of-when they are attempting to make sense.",Remember when Cersei became the first female monarch of The Seven Kingdoms despite having basically no claim and that was never properly discussed and nobody seemed to have a problem with it? Everyone just seemed to go along.,I'm still not over it.,"Are the people at the Game of Thrones subreddit still wanking over how utterly ""amazing"" that shitfest of a season was? I refuse to venture there without being inebriated.","Did anyone else listen to the commentary for episode 6?  [https://soundcloud.com/robbiesdane/got-8x06-commentary](https://soundcloud.com/robbiesdane/got-8x06-commentary) 

There were parts of that commentary where 2D couldn't even tell you character motivation. One of them said that Tyrion 'probably' felt guilty. You should know who he is! You should know what he feels. Wow.

Listening to that commentary made a few things clear to me. The first is that they did care, but they cared more about having fun with the cast than telling the story. They prioritised humour and cool shots to telling the story. They lost interest in the world GRRM built.","I hated Battle of Winterfell at the end, we got our expectations ""subverted"" in the worst way possible, still salty about Arya.

BUT. I liked the feeling of dread and the unstoppable waves of undead. Episode 2 set this up really well, and the beginning of the battle was super tense imo. That was pretty much the only thing i liked about the epsiode, after the constant plot armor and no major deaths after Ed... yea it fell flat after.

The political drama in the early stages is intriguing.,"I really just can't believe how bad they fucked this up.  I was looking forward to a rewatch almost as much as I was the final season, and the final was so bad I have zero desire to watch it all again.  So many storylines ignored, so much character and plot development just completely discarded, so many loose ends left untied.  Of the little bit they did wrap up almost all of it was entirely unfulfilling. 

This level of butchering a beloved IP is unprecedented.  There is good reason we're still here bitching about it months later.  I feel like this is more painful than no ending as a Firefly fan because at least I can still rewatch that time and time again and both speculate on what could be and enjoy the ride.","Bran was always one of the worst story line in the show but I always hoped that he will be awesome  at one point. But no, he sucked from the beginning until the end. Only the characters around him were cool like Osha, Myra and HODOOOOOR",Brienne?

Not all of it, and not for the story, but first and last episodes of S1, for naked Dany.",Lol Dany would've been a trash tier character if she didn't have dragons.,basically just watch the cleganes and call it a day,"Yup. One point that does not get made enough about the suckiness of seasons 5 and 6 is the politics in Mereen. In the books most of Essos except for the free cities are united against her. Unless Drogon undergoes a massive growth spurt soon, Dany is basically fucked. But in the show it's basically ""artificial drama then dracarys""","As much as D&D suck, I've said for a while that George's story in general tappers off greatly once he ends the war of five kings, kills off Joffery & Tywin, and sends Tyrion off to the east. The story gets stuck in a holding pattern where everyone important is spread thin waiting on Jon to die, get out of his vows, and become King in the North. Everything that made the first four seasons so fascinating was missing after that point.","I didn't watch Game of Thrones just for the political drama though. It was good, but I loved the story because of how the political and magical storylines related to each other, especially how they would converge at the end. I'm never watching ANY season of this show ever again.","I'd say season 5 is just as good, too.","Yeah, but she's a knight, the first woman to be knighted, and she's not just Bran's protector, she's KINGSGUARD.  Those guys are celebrities in Westeros.  They sing songs about them centuries after their deaths and they often make the history books.   By Westerosi standards, Brienne is a homely girl from Tarth, who everyone thought would amount to nothing due to her looks, and ended up making good.",When I was making this i couldnt stop laughing while typing that part lol,You can find that on Phub pretty easily,So like Sansa basically?,The people who downvoted you are to narcissistic to admit she sux,Clegane of Thrones,"Well, not really. Qarth, Yunkai, and Volantis are united against her. The Dothraki have her, weren't part of that alliance, and any scenario in which she gets away involves dealing with the Dothraki somehow, seperate from the alliance. YiTi is not involved, they are too busy in their own war of 5 Kings and dealing with grey plague. Astapor isnt involved, it's dead. The free cities other than Volantis aren't involved for various reasons. Myr, Tyrosh, and Lys would be but they fucking hate Volantis and fear the rise of the Tigers so they sit on the sidelines. I believe even New Ghis is sitting out. 

Of what is arrayed against her, Qarth ain't shit. They don't get conquered because they sit behind bitchin walls surrounded by shitty desert. That gives them serious defensive advantages, but they have difficulty projecting power. Yunkai uses slave soldiers and mercs. Much of Tyrions late chapters show how that is falling apart, with the White Made ravaging their soldiers and the slavers alike, and mercs being ready to turn coat. 

Only Volantis matters, but Volantis truly does matter. They are a great power with a large population, formidable Navy and army, and incredible wealth. They are one of the greatest powers in the world. They are a massive threat on their own.

But Dany has, unbeknownst to her, half the Iron Fleet bearing down on Meereen to woo her. They will arrive behind the Volantenes. They are the best there is at ship to ship combat and amphibious assault. The anti Dany alliance faces being caught between the hammer of the Iron Fleet and the anvil of a fortified city defended by unsullied, all while ravaged by disease.",That can't be. In the shows king daario and the second sons hold down slavers bay all on their own and happily ever after.,Yeah I'm not rewatching the show ever again. My only point was that up to season 4 it's a good solid story and then pretty much everything after that doesnt matter.,"I remember my wife doing a rewatch prior to Season 8 and I really felt that Season 5 was a huge drop off from the first 4. IMO, It's not even close.",Yep. They could have skipped the pumping and dumping tho.,It's accurate tho.,Of course. It doesn't give the same feel of staying classy though.,Yup,She just wasn't a great character at any point. Her leadership skills were garbage and everyone around her had to keep her in check. But the dragons were badass. That's about it,Shit dude. What could have been.,I just finished my first watch through so maybe on rewatch I'd think differently.,"I'm not really sure Jaime pumped and dumped her.  I don't think he set out to have sex with her and leave.   Instead, he looked like he wanted to make things work, but couldn't let go of Cersei.  Just because he loved Cersei, doesn't mean he never loved Brienne.  The Brienne/Jaime sex scene was about Jaime's arc, forcing Jaime to realize that he's too bound to Cersei to just let her die.   Sucks that Brienne had to get dragged into that, but it was her choice, and Jaime didn't set out to hurt Brienne.  He just couldn't serve both women that he loved.","No, it wasn't.  Jaime became a better person.  Continuing to love Cersei and wanting to take her into exile to save her life doesn't make him an ass.   He and Brienne had an honest relationship; that's why she wasn't bitter about his leaving her.   While I disagree with his choice, he became less callous and more thoughtful in regards to his words and actions during the series.  I just wish they'd made his choices and motivations clearer, but that would have taken time and D&D were so hot to get working on Star Wars they ignored GoT.  Thankfully they got what they deserved.",That's true. Seems like the sex scenes are the only rewatchable part of this shit show SMH,Sucks that she was reduced to an incident in Jaime's arc.,I thought book Jaime was done with Cesei's manipulation and finally realised that she'd been his abuser.,"""they got what they deserved."" I don't agree at all, they could have done Star Wars for all I care, but they should have done GOT properly. But remember , Bran the Broken as king was Grrms idea.","For me the issue is that she chose to become a Kingsguard.  Despite the fame and reputation, if Brienne had learned anything from Jaime it was that being Kingsguard inevitably ended up forcing a knight to choose between their vows and their honor, even under the best of circumstances.  Westerosi politics always put a Kingsguard in that position.  Even if Jaime and Brienne had remained just good friends, she should have learned that and decided that the price of Kingsguard accomplishment and fame was too high.  

That way Jaime gets one more good deed to show his complexity (helping Brienne make a wiser decision than most knights would if offered the chance to be a Kingsguard) and Brienne would have an open future to make her own legend on her honorable terms and maybe even find love again with a southron man who isn't so broken.    That would be how I'd have ended Brienne's arc.","Book Jaime has just turned on Cersei, but we don't know what's going to happen next as that is pretty much where his storyline left off in the last book.  Show Jaime chose to try and save his sister and died for the attempt.  That didn't mean that he didn't grow as a person.  He didn't leave to keep Cersei in power, only to save her life.   That is honorable, if misguided, at least by Westerosi standards.","You&#39;re a good man, Catts3. Thank you.","I'd rather she stayed in the North and become Lord Commander of Sansa's Queensguard. Of course, I'd also rather they hadn't turned Sansa into a robot.",Nah,"But that would have been stagnation for Brienne.  Brienne would have no where else to go in her life in the North.   Brienne needed to face the south that had caused all her self doubt and self hatred, particularly Tarth and the Stormlands.  A better fate would be for her to head to Storm's End and help Gendry learn about the land he's now Lord Paramount of.  This would force the south to deal with the new, improved Brienne of Tarth, Ser Brienne.  Gendry would learn what it means to be a Stormlander and a highborn from Brienne, so that Gendry can serve his people, and Brienne can protect them as a knight of the Stormlands, helping her people rebuild after the chaos of the past few years.","That would have been all right. But I can also see her emerging as Sansa's advisor, helping her build a court second only to King's Landing. Perhaps continuing the training, establishing a martial academy that would welcome all students regardless of origin. Also, let's be honest, I like to ship her and Sansa--I think they would be good influences on one another.","I want to make babies with her. Think of them, great big monsters. They&#39;d conquer the world.","While I can see this working out, I fear it doesn't have the same dramatic resonance.  Southron Westeros is the monster Brienne must slay.  Staying in the North would be safe for Brienne. If she and Sansa found love, it's 'and they lived happily ever after', but there's no drama in that.",How did this bot get triggered?

That plot point COULD have been good, it COULD have been interesting, but it wasn\'t. The problem with it is Luke\'s motivation. Why does Luke believe the Jedi need to die? That\'s the entire reason why he thought about killing Kylo and why he went into exile, so what\'s the answer? There isn\'t one. At least not one set up in the movie. All we see in the film is Luke saying he saw Snoke luring Kylo in and then got scared. We don\'t see why Luke is afraid of Snoke, how the Jedi teachings failed him, or how Luke became a pessimistic coward. We don\'t follow that plot point because it makes no sense from the last time we saw Luke. This is the reason Mark Hamill has stated he couldn\'t view his character as Luke, and instead had to see him as Jake Skywalker.

TFA, in the small picture, does recreate Rebels vs Empire. But it is very explicit that the New Republic is the power in the galaxy, the First Order is on the fringes of the galaxy outside New Republic control, that the Resistance is a local group fighting the First Order in that section of the galaxy, and that the New Republic is funding / helping the Resistance by proxy. \n\nThe First Order is explicitly *not* all powerful. It is a regional power in that section of the galaxy. \n\nSo while its basically ANH 2.0 on the small picture which we mostly see, the bigger universe is *vastly* different than ANH had. That is until TLJ was like ""lol jk for no reason whatsoever First Order controls the galaxy"".\n\n> It then establishes a bunch of mystery boxes- Who are Rey\'s Parents? Who is this Snoke?

One, the middle film doesn\'t need to solve all of them. Two, Rian Johnson very much intentionally chose the *least* satisfying answers, and often times the answers that canonically *make no sense*, because he thinks a \'good\' film can be measured in how upset you make the audience. He thinks purposefully giving unsatisfying answers is how you \'subvert\' the audience\'s expectations, and he also thinks subversion for the sake of subversion is a good plot device. Its genuinely 100% terrible.\n\nJust off the top of my head, Rey\'s parentage didn\'t really matter. It wasn\'t as emphasized as everyone tries to make it seem it was in TFA. Its there but overall unimportant, and any answer will do (although the delivery in TLJ seems very deliberate in a \'fuck anything that could happen there\' category, although funnily if the leaks are true...). The actual mystery is how Rey is so talented in the Force (which had a possibility of being answered by parentage), because there were many hints that this was a plot thread. Kylo seemed overly upset for just a \'random girl\', it seemed like he knew something. But TLJ didn\'t resolve any of that, it just made it worse by giving her more power for no reason.\n\nSnoke / First Order in general could use more expansion, at the moment all we have about them is that they are space nazis and want to rule the galaxy. When you come form the OT to the sequels, that kind of difference could use an explanation.\n\nLuke hiding is hinted at being related to the destruction of his academy in TFA. There are many ways to resolve this without destroying Luke / his whole character arc in the OT. I dig Luke feeling he failed to such a degree that he goes into exile. That\'s fine. But *how* he failed is important. Luke attempting to murder his nephew for kinda thinking he might go dark side one day is a terrible reason when the whole OT ended with him believing in a father he barely knew to be good. Its nonsensical. Have Luke go out for milk or something and come back to his academy destroyed by Snoke (who also kidnaps some of them for the Knights of Ren / his guards / Kylo), it helps expand on how Snoke came to power and it gives Luke a legitimate reason to go super depressed in a corner of the galaxy. Genuinely isn\'t that hard to spend 5 seconds coming up with better answers than Rian Johnson did (because, again, Rian Johnson *explicitly* aims for the *least satisfying* conclusion to any given scene/ plot thread because he thinks that\'s good storytelling lol).\n\n> The problem is, besides this literally being what both of his mentors did, that literally any other explanation for why Luke hid himself on a remote planet and tried to avoid being found is going to be far worse.\n\nNot at all. I already gave one half ass reason that\'s already 100 times better than ""luke tried to murder his sleeping defenseless nephew"". There are so many more. Maybe Luke was *too* nice and didn\'t stop Kylo, who then accidentally lops off someone\'s arm, which prompts to him kicking Kylo out of the academy and then Kylo joining Snoke and destroying Luke\'s Academy in vengeance. Maybe Luke ended up in a situation where he had to fight Snoke / First Order (or maybe just some wild animals) with some students and lost some of them, say Kylo\'s GF and Kylo blames him for it, resulting in him being bitter and defecting to Snoke etc etc. \n\nIt genuinely isn\'t hard to come up with more believable and true to character ways for Luke to get depressed and feel he failed, and to seek guidance at the original temple.\n\nLike, if you\'re saying Luke being a hermit is one of the best ways for the plot, then I agree. I just vehemently disagree on the why, and it is a very important why. Also I feel there are other legitimate reasons for a non depressed Luke to not interfere with current conflicts. But I think being depressed has better narrative qualities and would allow the new characters to shine as opposed to just sitting back and let Luke take care of everything (even though I wouldn\'t be against that either)']}","{'f9hmzuf': [2, '>Understanding Luke isn\'t in the new trilogy because Luke isn\'t the fucking protagonist\n\nThis is the worst argument I have ever seen for destroying a character.

If we're going with the Night King's army only killing half of theirs, there should have been roughly 45k soldiers left. I don't know how many people could fit inside Winterfell, but [this real castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak_des_Chevaliers) could only garrison 2000 men. Lets just bump that up to 5000 to be generous\\*. That puts 40k soldiers outside in freezing temperatures. It would be one thing if Game of Thrones was a less realistic show, but Stannis' camp had tons of issues due to the weather in season 5. Her and Varys acting like it was reasonable for them keep their army at Winterfell for an unknown amount of time make absolutely no sense.\n\n\\*That's a highly unrealistic number.

Lord of the Rings had a very medieval philosophy: that if the king was a good man, the land would prosper. We look at real history and it’s not that simple. Tolkien can say that Aragorn became king and reigned for a hundred years, and he was wise and good. But Tolkien doesn’t ask the question: What was Aragorn’s tax policy? Did he maintain a standing army? What did he do in times of flood and famine? And what about all these orcs? By the end of the war, Sauron is gone but all of the orcs aren’t gone – they’re in the mountains. Did Aragorn pursue a policy of systematic genocide and kill them? Even the little baby orcs, in their little orc cradles?  \n\n>The war that Tolkien wrote about was a war for the fate of civilization and the future of humanity, and that’s become the template. I’m not sure that it’s a good template, though. The Tolkien model led generations of fantasy writers to produce these endless series of dark lords and their evil minions who are all very ugly and wear black clothes. But the vast majority of wars throughout history are not like that.\n\nI think this is mostly a difference in interests and resources. Tolkien read a ton of myths (such as the Kalevala) and the general form of his work reflects that. In myth, especially mythologized epics, things are sort of elevated from reality but still reflect it, sometimes reflecting reality more accurately than if one used realism instead.\n\nMartin draws a lot from popular history and historical fiction, basing the manner of his stories on the often gritty imaginings of those times and their events.

Cut back to Winterfell and Bronn arrives, he saw the NK on Viserion heading south and let's everyone know that KL is fucked. Flash back to KL, Euron walks into the ruined and snowy throne room where NK sits the throne. Euron is holding a baby, which he gives to NK. He's been pulling a craster this whole time and the Others are smart enough to ally with such humans. Euron will be allowed to keep the Iron Islands and conquer other island territory (stepstones, summer islands, etc) and once Westeros is conquered his ships will transport the Others to Essos to continue conquering. NK raises the dead, his army is larger than it ever was before and he still has more White Walkers. Back in Winterfell, the crew make battle plans. Bran tells them it had to be this way, he foresaw it and lied to everyone, but the NK has made a fatal mistake.\n\nEp. 5: Enact battle plans. The two armies meet before Harrenhal. It's epic. Bran wargs into Nymerias pack. The living at losing though. Dance of Dragons ensues. Dany gets injured an Drogon bugs out to protect her. Jon is outmatched and flees, NK pursues. NK catches him over God's Eye, wins, Jon lands with Rhaegal who flies off (or dies of wounds), NK goes for Jon and Dany appears on Drogon and knocks NK off Viserion, then fights Viserion overhead. Jon and NK duel, NK is winning, Jon barely able to backpedal further I the island, eventually getting to a circle of Weirwoods before the NK stabs him in the gut. NK smirks, before Ravens start fucking his face up. Cut to Bran with white eyes. From behind the Weirwoods, children of the forest emerge, chanting, as Weirwood roots rise up and bind the NK. Jon rides unsteadily, grasps Longclaw, and runs it through NK's heart. White Walker explosions and wights dropping ensues. Jon collapses. End episode.\n\nEp 6: Dany lands next to Jon. She holds him as he dies. The living burn the dead and the mood is somber, much has been lost Dany returns with Jons body. Flash forward 9 months. Turns out Dany got pregnant by Jon, the realm I celebrating the birth of her son. We learn of loose ends being tied up. Euron is still out there but his fleet has scattered, rumors are he's went pirate with the portion he kept. Bran has moved to the Gods Eye full time to be the 3ER. His contributions have resulted in Weirwoods being planted in most courts. Everything seems generally good. In Winterfell, Sansa is settling in as Wardeness of the North. It turns out Arya is missing. Aboard Eurons ship, hes about to get up to some rape. His crewmate is helping hold the girl down. Suddenly, the crewmate stabs Euron in the throat, and removes his own face, it's Arya. Back at court, at a small council meeting, whoever is on it is conducting business, but begin to allude to Dany displaying erratic behavior. This concern is silenced as the queen enters, and it's clear that she commands respect through fear.""]}","{'f92rvbr': [2, 'Yeah it did.

Seasons 7 and 8 were just the icing on the cake of bad, but it had been obvious for a while by that point that the show was broken.\n\nYet there are still so many people like OP who not only don\'t seem to care that much about the flaws in Seasons 5 and 6, but considers those seasons to be the peak of the show. It\'s crazy to me. But that just goes to show how bad Season 8 was. It unites people who had long thought the show was getting bad with people who, for some reason, think Season 6 is the best season of the show. All can agree on how bad Season 8 was.\n\nBut yeah, Season 6 really was a train wreck.

Season 6 was a disaster which is only elevated by those 3 things, and I think 2 out of 3 of those moments aren\'t even good. The Battle of the Bastards was great spectacle, but not good writing. It all hinged on us being surprised by Littlefinger showing up at the last second, which people saw coming a mile away, and it relies on Sansa being an absolute idiot, and it was filled with heavy plot armor for Jon. And the sept explosion might have been a great cinematic moment, but it was a huge cop out from the writers to take a situation where a character seemed to have no way out, and instead of writing a clever conclusion to those plot points, just blow it all up, and it was followed by the absolute idiocy of Cersei just being the undisputed queen. So even these moments which people remember making Season 6 good were only good at spectacle, but not being good writing.\n\nAnd if you actually set those moments aside, the season was just so weak. The absolutely ridiculous Arya in Braavos arc, the completely boring lead up to the Battle of the Bastards (just scattered scenes of talking to random lords and ladies, trying to recruit them), etc. To reiterate, even if those moments in Season 6 were truly incredible, I don\'t think 3 great moments do enough to counteract a season full of bad in order to call the season great; it would just be a bad season with a few great moments.

Sansa was NOT warden of the North, Jon would have been, though we never saw Daenerys appoint him such, we only know she offered it when they first met if he bent the knee. So that leaves Sansa as nothing more than the Lady of Winterfell, who would have been in no position to negotiate with Daenerys on behalf of the North. \n\nGetting past that, I would figure at that point, neither Jon nor Daenerys knew about his true identity, and they probably would have still been very much in love.

How does conflict with ONE house suddenly make the entirety of the south enemies/ outsiders / people the north just can’t bend the knee to for “reasons.” This doesn’t even make sense because the Lannisters control the west, while the Tyrells run the south. Is Sansa just ignoring all the people who tried to help her or comfort her? Olenna? Margaery?

Then in season 8 she tells his secret when he specifically tells her not to, which puts Daenerys advisors against her. She wants Jon and Daenerys gone for “reasons.” That’s not even questioning how idiotic it was to scheme against your only chance to beat Cersei who’s your main enemy. And lastly she votes to send Jon to the wall for killing Daenerys SOMETHING SHE WANTED HIM TO DO, and doesn’t even mention him as the heir to the throne when voting on the new king.

Yes the Tyrells were plotting to take the throne, and even take the north via a marriage through Loras and Sansa. But notice how the Tyrells don’t hurt people along the way?

Why does Sansa hate **all** of the south because she was mistreated by the Lannisters, when it was a **Northern lord** who forced her into marriage with his bastard son, the bastard so who later became a **Northern lord** who raped her. Not only that but it was the **majority** of the northern houses who actively fought against the Starks when they retook winterfell, and it was **southern** soldiers who helped take back winterfell.

Sure, if Jon remained the Warden after the wars, I suppose he would\'ve been respected well enough but he wouldn\'t have held any political power de iure.

She can call for their troops, collect taxes, pass judgement over them, all of that. Yes, you have Alys ruling Karhold and so on but Sansa is her liege (or was until Alys\' death). That\'s how feudalism works, you have lesser lords sworn to higher lords. And then higher lords sworn to the king. As Lady of Winterfell, with all of the North behind her, Sansa was actually second only to the monarch.

The Iron Throne gave The Lannisters the power to elevate House Bolton to Wardens of the North.  The Iron Throne gave The Lannisters the power to forcibly marry Sansa to Tyrion.  The Iron Throne gave The Lannisters the power to elevate House Frey to the top of the Riverlands totem after they hosted the Red Wedding.   In Sansa\'s shoes, I would want to withdraw from the Seven Kingdoms too.\n\nAs for why Sansa hates ALL of the South, she doesn\'t hate the Vale but everyone else? Pretty much yeah.

He gave away the ENTIRE Kingdom, for starters.  When Sansa had one good idea, to let the soldiers rest before throwing them into another war, because Dany was feeling insecure, Jon puffed up like the Hulk and all but said ""Shut up Sansa.""  We the audience saw Jon was still going ""Yes, My Queen"" after strolling through the ashes of Dany\'s massacre of Kings Landing.  Tyrion had to remind Jon that Sansa\'s days we\'re numbered before he proceeded to have a semblance of backbone.

You\'re interpreting the statement that it is a military leadership position as indicative that it is *only* a military leadership position. \n\nI don\'t think that\'s the dynamic of a Warden. Jon, as King of/in the North bends the knee, but then is reduced to basically only a military leader breaks the very structure of feudalism, that is, unless he is also recognized as Lord of Winterfell. I\'d guess since the Northern lords named him King, they\'d probably be on board with him essentially being Lord of Winterfell. If, upon Jon\'s bending the knee, the Lord/Lady of Winterfell title went to Sansa, his bending of the knee becomes absolutely meaningless, because Sansa could just simply say ""nope, the North is not sworn to Daenerys of House Targaryen"". \n\nNow, the show leaves a lot out. As mentioned, we never see Jon named Warden of the North by Daenerys, so that\'s an assumption. We see neither Jon nor Sansa named/recognized as Lord or Lady of Winterfell, although Sansa is called that in the previous season by Littlefinger. So we can assume she was Lady of Winterfell because Jon was in a position higher than she. But what would have happened if, say, Ned Stark was to rebel and be named King in the North? Would Robb have then become Lord of Winterfell, or would Ned still be Lord of Winterfell?

I think your points are great, even if you disagree on the Dany/Jon support that Id imagine.\n\nA lot of people think Sansa hates Jon but she loves and respects him up until he endangers her home. Her wants in the show are: her home, her family, safety. When she does something the audience hates her for, it’s usually because something of hers is in danger. She tells Tyrion the secret because of her home and family in danger. When Jon doesn’t listen to her make plans because Littlefinger was involved, she goes behind his back to secure the Knights of the Vale in order to save her family and home. She doesn’t want Jon going south because Stark men never come back - so I agree with everyone that she wouldn’t like Dany, I just think the power marriage would make more sense than Bran on the throne.

In book one, Robert or Ned say something along the liens of it being honorary except in a time of war. But, so far in the series, we have seen little significance in regards to the title. Do the houses who are wardens have some control over the great houses who are not wardens? IS that why the riverlords seem to simply follow the northern lead?"" There was nothing in the question about the military aspect specifically, only what the title means, in general. And Martin answered that the Warden is a military commander. That\'s his definition. If there\'s more to it, why not add it? And, again, as the Warden of the East Jaime had no actual power over the Vale. \n\nI agree that it sort of ""breaks they very structure of feudalism"" for Jon to be the King in the North without being the Lord of Winterfell. Or the lord of something else at the very least. He was a king without his own seat, having no keep or lands to pass on to his heir. He was practically crashing at Sansa\'s. More than that, all northerner bannermen are sworn to both House Stark and the King in the North, which means that Jon, as the King in the North, and Sansa, as the Head of House Stark, commanded the very same people. Well, the very same people plus Sansa, in Jon\'s case, as his title as a king superseded hers as a lady. Still, they administrated the very same lands, had the very same bannermen... And had a right to call for the same troops. Jon\'s only average was his title. Looking at it realistically, there probably would\'ve been a civil war between Jon\'s and Sansa\'s heirs in the future had things stayed that way (seriously, one of them would need to produce no children, and then name the other\'s as their own heir to avoid a power struggle).\n\nThe title of the Lady of Winterfell did not went to Sansa when Jon bent the knee, she assumed it after the Battle of the Bastards. She was called the Lady of Winterfell by Jon at the end of season 6, then again by a Winterfell guard in season 7, she called herself that in her conversation with Brienne... That\'s on top of my head, all before bending the knee. Furthermore, the lords would actually have a pretty good reason not to recognize Jon as the Lord of Winterfell: he was a bastard and at least one of his true-born siblings were still alive. The title of the Lord of Winterfell is hereditary. Accepting Jon in Sansa\'s stead would set a precedence for a bastard child to inherit before true-born children, and that basically fucks-up the very base of an inheritance system in their world (as well as Jon\'s entire characterization... which was later fucked-up anyway... eh). It also means that the lords would be undermining their own positions as legitimate heirs of their predecessors, and create a very risky situation for their legitimate children, who now would be in danger of being disinherited by their base-born siblings. That\'s a perfect way to ensure family struggles for generation and general instability. We need to look no further than Blackfyre Rebellions to see that. Basically, the politics on the show were completely messed-up in later seasons. For all that to work you\'d need to assume that a) the title of the King of the North was granted by proclamation and therefore was not a hereditary one, keeping the laws of inheritance in tact b) Jon\'s bending the knee was sort of his ""last will"" as the king, to be headed even after he lost his position (like Ned should\'ve become Protector of the Realm, an order of king Robert to be headed after his death). Reaching, not gonna argue about it, but trying to figure out in-universe answers here is a nightmare. We can only imagine that if the next book comes ut, it will set quite a different situation.\n\nHad Ned rebelled, he would\'ve been both the King in the North and the Lord of Winterfell. Just like Robb was both (Bran was only the acting lord during Robb\'s absence at Winterfell) That\'s a normal situation: separating these titles is not. It\'s actually stupid but that\'s what the show went with, so here we are. Things make no sense in GoT.

I don't think her feelings come from an entirely rational place but I can still see why the character has issues.\n\nAfter everything that happened in Winterfell, being subjugated again, within it's walls probably doesn't sit well with her either.\n\nI thought Sansa told Tyrion as a kind of Hail Mary.  She wanted Jon pushing for Northern Independence and she saw he was never going to be on her side.  At that point I think she felt she had lost and Dany had won, and telling the secret was about hurting Dany politically (if it could cause damage) and personally.\n\nI agree with others that Sansa does have a self-centered view of the world but I think her experiences differ from the other remaining Starks in that amidst their horror they also saw the good in people.  Arya formed genuine friendships with Hot Pie and Gendry.  Jon formed genuine friendships with Pyp, Grenn, Edd and Sam.  Bran with Meera and her Brother.   While Sansa and She were close, it was a circumstantial closeness.  Neither would truly sacrifice for the other.   After escaping that viper pit, she runs to family (Lysa) and said family tries to murder her.\n\nI think Sansa was closed off in ways a lot of other characters were not.  After everything that happened Empowerment and safety (as she perceives it) was much more important then Love and friendship.\n\nI'm not sure she would have moved passed things had Dany gotten everything she wanted.   I do believe Sansa holds grudges.  She wouldn't have staged an out and out rebellion but I do think she would have deeply hated Dany henceforth and forevermore.

Mon Calamari ships have lots of bubble shapes around their ships that are all generators why the weird look but notoriously strong in that sense.

She\'s just starting out whereas Littlefinger has been down this road many times. Sansa is struggling to connect with a sister who has changed a lot, had some ill feelings from the past, and had different outlook of world. \n\nJust because she is struggling with trust issues doesn\'t mean she is seeking power for power sake. Just because she learned from Cersie and Littlefinger doesn\'t mean she\'s abandoned her identity in the North or her desire to rebuild her family and Winterfell\'s reputation. She wants return to normalcy but now knows she has to be more manipulative and political to get it. That\'s where her heart is, rebuilding her family and rebuilding Winterfell.\n\nAfter Battle of Bastards, during the forehead kiss scene with Jon and the scene where Littlefinger tries to kiss her near the Weirwood Tree, you can sense Sansa is is no position to seek leadership. She wants a return to normalcy and to be with loved ones she can finally trust. She wants Jon to be the patriarch of the Stark family and to live in her parent\'s chambers. She wants to have a familial relationship with Jon that she lacked as a child. She is embarassed by her relationship with Littlefinger and the attacks on her reputation for marrying her enemies. she\'s disgusted by Littlefinger\'s desire to pursue her over a throne located in area she was abused but doesn\'t know how to deal with. she wasn\'t in the right mental state to seek power. she still raised in an environment to look towards honorable men as leaders. If you keep those inner motivations in mind, it should be clear that despite Sansa\'s desire to manipulate her surroundings, she\'s not going to hurt her family. I think Sophie Turner played that pretty well.\n\nLittlefinger and Sansa at Weirdwood Tree (Season 6 finale)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WgsCx7TwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WgsCx7TwM)\n\nJon Sansa forehead kiss scene (Season 6 finale)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibXUScOskAQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibXUScOskAQ)\n\nThus, I don\'t agree that Sansa is self-serving. In Season 4, she dreamed of re-building Winterfell (scene she built it with snow before smacking her cousin). that has been her motivation after escaping with Littlefinger. rebuilding her family. that is her soft spot. so despite the sibling struggles, mistrust, pain, she wants everything to return to how it was before she left Winterfell. although she has fantasies of love and marrying a nice king/knight in shining armor, her top priority is rebuilding Winterfell and creating a fantasy. Her fantasy with marrying Joeffrey as a naive girl wasn\'t based on a desire for politics and manipulation and thirst for power, but on fairy tale view of love.  She realized her view of love was naive and has learned the hard way she has to be more vigilant about people\'s motives. \n\nI didn\'t see Sansa upset with Brienne\'s ""loyalty"" to Arya. I think she was surprised the young girl playing with broom sticks is now a skilled assassin. She thought Arya was joking but is disturbed by the practice fight scene between her and Brienne. I didn\'t see any concern from Sansa bout Brienne not being loyal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is inconsistent with character shown on screen that Sansa would desire power at the expense of rebuilding the family she had previously lost.']}","{'f91cuyf': [4, 'Exactly my feelings after watching this and remembering all the emotions of this great episode \n\nGod damn it man']}",{},"{'f9428jl': [2, ""you only see a close up of her face, you can't actually see where she's looking. it seems when Jon gets out of the pit and runs after Ramsey is the first time she notices him and her expression changes to worry.""]}","{'f8z344f': [7, 'he still had some character and personality left at that point (albeit the stupid decisions made in that episode)']}","{'f94j61o': [1, 'Lmfaoo']}",{},"{'f8xsziy': [30, ""The same Sansa who nearly had Arya killed before she confirmed from Bran what Arya's true intentions were?

Actually, first time I saw the scene I probably thought that. I actually came to conclusion about Jon and Sansa very late (start of Season 8). I had no idea of existence of Jonsa when I watched season 6 or 7 the first (and only time). In fact, if someone had mentioned that back then, I'd have dismissed it immediately. Watching season 8 threw off a huge red flag which led me to do research and rewatch season 6 and 7. \n\nI find it suspicious the producers direct scenes almost exactly the same way as his father when protecting his wife (deja vu). or the scene where they are saying goodbye as the same way as their parents. Neither Jon nor Sansa were in the vicinity of their parents during the respective scenes I mentioned. that seems like an artistic choice of trying to create parallels. parallels that on the surface would seem unnecessary if they are repeating knowledge that we already know. \nhow a writer can use analogies or metaphors to convey an idea, the director and producer is creating parallels between scenes and the question becomes why are they doing that? repeatedly. they do this multiple times throughout the show. why do they do this repeatedly? they did this back in Season 6. if Season 8 was the only season they did this, I can interpret it to D&D trolling to fan base feedback, but they do this almost immediately when Jon and Sansa reunite in Season 6. why? \n\nI don't think I need to respond to your assertion of Jon's psychology, because you're doing what you're are accusing me of doing. You're engaging in arm chair psychology of a character. I can do the same. not saying you can't interpret it your way, just that you're engaging in the same extrapolation and interpretation of a character's motives without support. \n\nJon admires his father, Ned. I don't see it as a stretch he might subconsciously or consciously adopt his courting habits in a way that might not be totally appropriate.  \n\nJon is attracted to red headed women (the show goes to great length to show Jon chose a red headed Ros to be with back in Winterfell). As a man, I'll say its unusual for men to focus on the color of a woman's hair, but they deliberately have Sam Tarly ask Jon what color was her hair. They wanted the viewer to know Jon has a thing for red heads. Then he gets with Ygritte. Then is paired up with Sansa, considered one of the most attractive women in Westeros right afterward who has the same rare hair color. The show draws parallels between Jon and Ned and between Catelyn and Sansa. \nThe show has scenes where Jon/Ygritte are standing in similar position as Jon/Sansa. This is a choice D&D likely made. I can excuse one coincidence, but it seems a stretch when its done repeatedly. \n\nMartin is a writer that likes to go outside the box and make parallels between scenes and ideas. The show uses these techniques which I think should send a signal to the viewer without having to actually say something out loud.""], 'f94i46e': [1, 'sign09, with all due respect, I feel that attributing comments other ""Jonsa"" posters and theoriests you\'ve seen to me is in appropriate.

I just you should respond to posters individually, not as membership of a group and stereotyping them. if you don\'t want to respond to posters, that is fine, but it seems dismissing a viewpoint because you want to ascribe them to a group seems premature.\n\nin response to your comment by George RR Martin. the translated comment says probability that Jon will come back in the books is \'remote\'. We\'ll see if that is the case, but it seems like he\'s being bit coy here. if Winds of Winter comes out and Jon is dead, then I\'ll accept that (and thus) but I think that statement if it is correct seems intended to hide information instead of reveal.  \nhe says that Jon will not marry Sansa, which I think is a fair statement, that doesn\'t happen in the show and seems unlikely. the translation is very poor so I\'m going to need the original English or a better one because it uses incomplete or run-on sentences.

I don\'t see how that extends to a villainious turn. she is defending her reputation. Jon is very forgiving person and forgave her the first time in that forehead kiss scene and their reunion. he doesn\'t hold grudges and Sansa seems to appreciate him for that. Arya is not the same way, she holds grudges for long time and so Sansa has to defend her reputation to her. \n\nanother thing we can\'t be certain of is whether or not Sansa and Arya are performing publicly for Littlefinger and any spies watching. that is a possibility and feedback about it has been all over the place.

In S7 there are some questionable things that happen that make me think “damn, X character is LUCKY that Y character was able to do such and such for them”, among some bullshit character changes in personality (Tyrion) that basically changed who they were and watered down their personalities.\n\nS8 was all of that and worse. I watched every episode and developer commentary as it aired to try and get a sense of anything that I may have missed. The first two or three episodes (the ones *before* the Long Night) were actually pretty good and were hyping me up for the battle with the Night King.

In a way, it’s not the fact that he went north that bothers me, after all he may find it hard to fit in the south considering his true lineage.

If Dany decrees all the high lords and ladies need to come and kneel, then Sansa and Arya won't, then they're going to die.\n\nSansa and Arya weren't the head of their family. No one would normally require that the lord paramount younger sisters swear fealty to the. If this was a real issue, Dany would have had them bend the knee while she was in Winterfell. The real problem was that Sansa had already tried to stage a coup. They had her do that to drive the plot while trying to act like she was innocent. That's why D&D tried to spin the Tyrion scene as if she didn't tell him Jon's secret.\n\nAll of this nonsense had to be implied because if you really get down to it, Jon was supposedly protecting his sisters from the consequences of committing a crime and/or breaking faith with the queen. The plot relied on the audience just going along with the double standard they were setting up. Arya would obviously kill someone that didn't kneel to Jon. She was even considering killing her own sister in season 7. Sansa wanted to punish children for their parents crimes. Jon would executed lords that didn't bend the knee to him. If Jon was being written with logic in mind, he would have actually dealt with his sisters instead of killing Dany. Think about that justification for a second. Your sisters might commit treason or murder and instead of dealing with them, you kill their target instead. They couldn't make things clear because it would have highlighter their shitty writing.\n\n>But if faced with Torrhen Stark's choice, would Sansa kneel to save her people from death and destruction?\n\nThe problem with that is that Sansa wasn't the queen in the north. She didn't really have any people. At least none that really mattered. Jon was king in the north when he knelt. He was responsible for making sure his people kept faith with the queen. Torrhen Stark also had lords and family members that didn't like that he had bent the knee. The difference was that he actually dealt with them like an actual leader instead walking around like a sad puppy.\n\n>Probably.\n\nThis is the other problem. The Sansa from season 6-8 was stubborn to the point of seeming suicidal. That's part of the reason they just kept implying she wouldn't kneel. It would have been maid painfully obvious how stupid they made the characters if they actually had to deal with the consequence of their actions. Instead we just get a bunch of silly implications that don't really make sense. D&D had a similar problem with the battle of the bastards. Jon's plan for defeating Ramsey makes absolutely no sense. They had less than half of the men that Ramsey did and their enemy had much better position than them.

Westerosi politics always put a Kingsguard in that position.  Even if Jaime and Brienne had remained just good friends, she should have learned that and decided that the price of Kingsguard accomplishment and fame was too high.  \n\nThat way Jaime gets one more good deed to show his complexity (helping Brienne make a wiser decision than most knights would if offered the chance to be a Kingsguard) and Brienne would have an open future to make her own legend on her honorable terms and maybe even find love again with a southron man who isn't so broken.
