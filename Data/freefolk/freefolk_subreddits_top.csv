You may have heard of the fundraiser for Kit Harington's endorsed charity Mencap, supporting people with learning disabilities to live independent and fulfilling lives. 

This is a topic that is close to Kit's heart as his cousin Laurant has a learning disability. You can read more about Kit's link to the charity on the link below, and in [this video from him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlH8B00Pnvo).

The link to donate is here: [https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/thekinginthenorth](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/thekinginthenorth)

Please feel free to donate and share! Let's give Kit the recognition he deserves for absolutely nailing it, and support a charity that means so much to him.

We've seen what this community can do, so let's knock this one out the park for the King in the North!

Also, we're trying to get HBO to match the donations in this and the SameYou fundraiser, so if you tweet at them, we've been using this: *@HBO @GameOfThrones @WarnerMediaGrp We‚Äôve supported GoT for years. Please, support your fans and your cast by matching all donations to @SameYouOrg & @mencap_charity. @RedditFreeFolk #HBOfortherealm #fetchthedonationstretcher*

#THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO IS DONATING AND SHARING!

# FINAL UPDATE:

100k! i think my work here is done. By now everyone knows about the fundraiser and it will remain open for the foreseeable future in case you'd like to keep giving (i know i will!). A spin-off fundraiser for Mencap was started and we've also launched [\#GoTtoGive](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bvxrmj/getting_hbo_to_match_donations_to_kit_emilias/) in an effort to have our donations matched. Plus Emilia [shouted us out](https://twitter.com/SameYouOrg/status/1136612061306327040) again which has given us that little bit more of a push. I will keep updating the [main fundraiser page](https://justgiving.com/fundraising/justicefordaenerys) (updates can be found at the bottom) but this post can't handle much more content! We've done a good thing here, but now my watch is ended. Thanks for letting me be a part of this! Now on your best behaviour incase Emilia decides to visit.

\~ Sarah aka elle\_ellaria

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 12**: i'm so sorry for all the server issues the website has been experiencing for a prolonged period now, if you're trying to donate but unable all i can ask is that you keep trying! in other disappointing news, People magazine strike [AGAIN](https://i.imgur.com/kQPSAos.png) with their misinformation. Pure incompetence, or malicious intent? Anyway, let's keep pushing this. We're *tantalisingly* close to 100K, and i'm doing my best behind the scenes to secure some high profile donations.. let's fucking *do* this freefolk.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 11**: okay, lots of news! fundraiser for Kit gaining LOTS of traction, we crossed the $100k mark for Emilia's charity (over ¬£80k!), lots more coverage since Emilia dropped her [video](https://twitter.com/SameYouOrg/status/1134100107065024512), AND.... **the mods of this sub decided send some emails to HBO and Warner Media executives**, telling them about the fundraiser and letting them know now would be a great time to match the donations! I think this is a great idea and will be emailing them myself as well. At this point, I'd *love* to see some higher ups, prominent cast & crew members etc. start joining in on the donation drive. To have fans AND creators come together like this would be an amazing show of solidarity at the conclusion of this behemoth series and *completely overshadow* any other coverage this last season has received. We've already shown how powerful and far-reaching this community is, time & again. I'll leave this one with you..

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/brj5vq/video/slyrsba4fw131/player

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 10**: ok when i said i‚Äôd update if something special happened i was NOT expecting..[that](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByFoDvGFXoB/?igshid=ei4esofgwy86)!? Also I wanted to share [this](https://heavy.com/entertainment/2019/05/emilia-clarke-charity-fundraiser-interview-creator-elle-ellaria/) article Stephanie from heavy.com just posted. Stephanie was one out of tens, TENS of journalists I reached out to who previously wrote about the petition and the ONLY one who actually took an interest in covering this story. She does a great job conveying the message - please do give it a read! I mentioned Sophie, Kit and the misconception of the fundraiser being an ‚Äúapology‚Äù for the petition. Oh and since People magazine and other outlets keep misrepresenting the intention, I‚Äôve gone ahead and updated the fundraiser description, right slap bang at the top. #NOTANAPOLOGY

And finally, if you‚Äôre not in a position to donate, DO NOT FUCKING FEEL BAD. Lots of people comparing the number of donations to the number of upvotes. **Lots of cunts**. I know what it‚Äôs like to count pennies to survive. You‚Äôre all doing what you can with your updoots and shares. I‚Äôm fucking grateful for all of you. We‚Äôve done a good thing here.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 9**: ¬£35,000 (close to 45k in $) in just 5 days!!! amazing feat lads. Well done. It seems like things are winding down now, so let me thank everybody one more time for pushing this fundraiser to where it is. Anyone could have started this fundraiser, it‚Äôs all of you who have made it successful. Every donation - no matter how small or seemingly insignificant - every share, every hashtag, every signal boost‚Ä¶ every single one made a difference.

The fundraising page will continue to be up - bookmark it! Donations will be transferred by Just Giving directly to SameYou on a weekly basis. Remember there are also links to Lena, Nikolaj, Liam, Kit, Sophie etc.‚Äôs charities at the bottom of the page if you also wish to support them too, now or in future.

And for those asking if Emilia has heard about this, she has! SameYou accounts on twitter & IG have been boosting the fundraiser, and the mother of mother of dragons herself has reached out to say thank you & that they‚Äôre both thrilled to see Emilia‚Äôs story inspire people to engage in the movement for neurorehabilitation.

This will be the final update, until/unless something special happens - so keep an eye out! Mods, I‚Äôd appreciate if this could stay pinned just a little while longer. Thanks again for all the support!

**UPDATE 8**: 32k lads! Shout out to ComicBook NOW! who wrote lovely article on the fundraiser mentioning us but mostly focusing on Emilia's charity & past health struggles. HuffPo have also made a correction on their previous misrepresentation. Well done everyone!

**UPDATE 7**: We're almost at 29K! There have been people who have donated in the hundreds, and others who dug deep and did they could with a couple of dollars. Grateful for EACH and EVERY one of you. Screenrant, Decider and Digital Spy have all done stories on us. I'm hoping the fundraiser will get a push after the HBO ""Last Watch"" Documentary airs as well. I'll update again when I have something. ^(ps. fuck olly)

**UPDATE 6**: Fuckinggg..... 25k ? can i just say a quick thanks to both [u/dropandgivemenerdy](https://www.reddit.com/u/dropandgivemenerdy) and [u/DiamondPup](https://www.reddit.com/u/DiamondPup) for swooping in early and helping me set up/write the post for the fundraiser when I was struggling with wording, and also thank you to everyone on this sub who has chipped in with their suggestions and feedback, you‚Äôve really helped shape the tone of this campaign. You guys made this happen. Keep it rolling!

**UPDATE 5**: 23k! And... [EW wrote that story on us](https://ew.com/tv/2019/05/24/game-of-thrones-reddit-community-emilia-clarke-fundraiser/)! The answers were edited down but I think they did a great job conveying the sentiment behind the campaign. I'll post the [full list of questions & answers](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/brj5vq/can_we_collectively_do_something_nice_for_emilia/eonxn3m/) I gave in a comment so you can see what they left and what they decided to take out. Keep sharing! BEST FANS EVAA!

**UPDATE 4**: We hit 20k in less than 48 hours! Amazing job everyone! Also, some news... Entertainment Weekly have reached out with some questions for an article they plan on doing about the fundraiser! I'll update this post once it's been published. Let's keep this going!

**UPDATE 3:** We're over 17k! Also the very lovely Dan from Fandomentals reached out to ask a few questions and did a nice little [article](https://www.thefandomentals.com/stand-by-dany-fan-led-charity-fundraiser-thanking-emilia-clarke-raises-10000-in-a-day/) on us, be sure to check it out!

**UPDATE 2**: Ten. Thousand. Pounds. AND RISING! Less than 600 donations, just under 24 hours. Thousands of upvotes, shares, likes, tweets and comments.. You beautiful, beautiful bastards.

**UPDATE 1**: We broke 5k with less than 300 donations. Thank you so much to each and every one of you who donated, upvoted, shared, boosted. I'd love to see this keep building momentum!

# Original post dated 22nd May: ‚Äã

Since there's been so much negativity flying around, especially with that petition gaining traction, I thought maybe we could do something really decent that can make a difference in peoples' lives, and show a little love for one castmember in particular.

Incase you weren't aware, Emilia wrote a [personal essay](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/emilia-clarke-a-battle-for-my-life-brain-aneurysm-surgery-game-of-thrones) for the New Yorker in March about her experience suffering two brain hemorrhages, the first of which happened shortly after wrapping season 1. With that essay she launched her charity SameYou, in aid of increasing neuro-rehabilitation access to young people after brain injury.

Posted below are excerpts from interviews she's given since the finale aired which I found particularly moving, although both are worth reading in full. Bear in mind when you read, D&D did not bother to inform her in advance about Dany's turn. It was a complete shock.

It's clear that Emilia invested much of herself into Dany and in turn drew strength from her when she needed it. The fact that the showrunners did not even care to inform her of her character's turn, let alone write a properly fleshed-out script that did her character (and others!) justice, is unforgivable. They've since scurried away to avoid the backlash they knew was inevitable, but the actors are getting the brunt of it. And I just thought... how wonderful a gesture would it be for them, and for Emilia especially, to see fans of the show coming together in aid of a cause that is so dear to her heart. To really know that we appreciate her and this character she's inhabited for the better part of the last decade.

On a personal note, as someone who suffers from chronic illness, Emilia's portrayal of Daenerys means so much more to me since finding out what she went through. The fact that she stared her mortality in the face and did not give up, did not give in, and was able to come through with such a stellar performance.. is beyond inspiring.

So we got a lot of whingers from r/all complaining we out there spoiling shit, so I thought yeah, I'll go see what the crack is. To my shock, top of all, #1 post, [was a copy of this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/freefolk/comments/bqqytt/be_a_dragon/) posted some 8 hours later. So I clicked, because why not, and saw it's a locked thread. ""That can't be right"" I thought. Why locked? Oh yes, coz people pointing out it's content stolen from the ultimate kneeler taboo. Freefolk. 

Now, I'm not gonna link to the kneeler post. Coz they would only accuse me of unspeakable horrors. So instead [HERE IS THE LINK TO THE CEDDIT VERSION, COMPLETE WITH REMOVED COMMENTS](https://snew.notabug.io/r/gameofthrones/comments/bqv10b/spoilers_how_the_scene_really_shouldve_looked_like/) because fuck it, why not. 

See I mistakenly thought these days were behind us. Turns out, once a kneeler, always a fookin kneeler.
