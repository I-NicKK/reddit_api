0,e4w4vv,How would I buy a voucher for this game for my son-in-law for Christmas?,"Hi all,

My son-in-law loves this game on his phone. I would like to buy a voucher for the game so he could treat himself. I have absolutely no idea how I would go about this? He used to have an iPhone so (I presume) I \*could\* have bought him an iTunes voucher. However, he's changed his phone now to an Android phone. 

My questions are...

1) How do I buy a voucher for the game that will work on an Android phone?

2) How much does everything cost in the game? i.e. what would be an acceptable amount for a voucher? I don't want to give him a voucher that he can't buy anything with? (I'm in the UK ). 

Thanks for any help you can give me. :-)",8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/e4w4vv/how_would_i_buy_a_voucher_for_this_game_for_my/,2019-12-02 11:26:00
1,dzp5mz,K22 in Kingdom 461,"I have exquisite and epic Kingsguard and Bolton gear (level 30), Fine whent and stark (level 25), Fine and exquisite siege engineer gear. The power level is about 9.5 million. At the moment there are 480,000 troops in the city (mostly T8s) with a dragon about to reach level 27. I don't play the game often anymore, so if you get this account you will have over 280% in training speed to increase power level even further, and most of my farms, sawmills, quarries, etc are near level 20, so you should have no problem in training as much as you want and upgrading the keep soon, and additionally I have tobho gear which gives you 4 hours and 20 minutes of free building time. House level is 31, about to reach 32. I liked the game at first but it's taking up too much of my time, so I would like to sell it to make up for the amount of money I spent on it. The price is negotiable, but I'd rather see it go for 250 or OBO. Pm me for more info.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/dzp5mz/k22_in_kingdom_461/,2019-11-21 23:14:35

13,ds00us,Vacation Mode,"Hello all,

I would like to ask if there is a ""Vacation Mode"" in the game. 

I mean for example if I know that I´m not going to have no internet access for like 2-3 day or more while away. (I know other online games with such feature and I couldn´t find anything similar in the menu of the game).

Thank you very much!",14,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/ds00us/vacation_mode/,2019-11-05 17:39:31

It's Kingdom 455. Right now, my job is in the process of deep cleaning the kitchen, and hopefully I won't be working the 5th so I can start the process of taking people in.

I'm sorry I'm still new and I couldn't find this information anywhere. How much % of resources do you take when attacking other players?

I found some inactive players with like 300k resources and no defense. But when I attack, I don't get any looting...

17,dnmsbg,Does Anyone Want To Join Me In A New Kingdom?,"I played earlier on in late April for two weeks and did pretty well, in comparison to other power levels. I believe I only spent like $10? I accepted a new job in Yellowstone National Park, where Cricket doesn't have service. My contract is up on the 5th where I'll leave the park and regain service, but I'm coming back for the winter so I'm switching to Verizon.

I was curious if there's anyone that wishes to join me in my new kingdom. It'll be probably be sometime between the 6th and 7th of November when I'll start. I plan on spending $200-$600 a month once I get a handle of the game, though that's not a guarantee. I want an aggressive alliance, but not one that holds *all* the SOPs. I want it to be fun, not kill the kingdom. I don't necessarily need big spenders, but I do need people to be active. Not a job per se, but active logging in at least once a day, as the alliance can only thrive if you're active in it. It's perferable to have people who are experienced, but having people that are new will help just as much.

Also, thank you to all of those that have helped so far with questions.",18,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/dnmsbg/does_anyone_want_to_join_me_in_a_new_kingdom/,2019-10-27 05:19:33
18,dnl7jg,K30/T10 account FS in 6 month old kingdom,"Not sure what's supposed to go into an account sale post, but the basic stats are that the Kingdom started in April, has been merged once, and I'm one of around 10-15 K30s in the kingdom.  Also have a level 52 dragon which is also in the top 10 in the kingdom.  Also around 65 million combined power and plenty of boxed RSS, mats, advanced mats, and various good stuff.  Happy to send screenshots of exact stats or answer any questions over PM.  Don't have an exact price in mind, I'll consider reasonable offers, I'm bored of the game and mildly annoyed at myself for overspending, will be happy to get pennies back on the dollar and get rid of the temptation to keep playing.

19,dn3k0q,Buying Packs,"A handful of you were a lot more helpful then r/GOTC is, where it seems like you're more likely to get downvoted rather then people helping you.  


Another question I have is focused on packs. In Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire, packs started out at $4.99 then went up to $19.99 and then $99 and stayed there. After a while if you hadn't purchased anything, it might to as low as $50. Im curious as to how packs work in this game. Do they stay at $.99 and after a few purchases go up to the next price tier? What packs should I absolutely avoid, and which should I buy? I'd look up videos, but the wifi where I lived and work is complete and utter shit. Also, I'll read somewhere online where someone will say, ""Buy these two packs!"" and person B is saying to buy other packs. So I just wanted to get a general consensus, and when suggesting packs, please state your reasoning as well.",9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/dn3k0q/buying_packs/,2019-10-26 00:46:53
