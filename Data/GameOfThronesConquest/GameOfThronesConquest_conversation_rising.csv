I didn't realise I could just use a Google Play Store Card. $100!!!!???!!! I wasn't planning on spending that much. I have already bought him a load of stuff. Is that the minimum that would mean anything on that game then? I was thinking along the lines of £20 ($27 ish???).

Thanks.","Packs are $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100. A $20 pack would help and I’m sure he or she would appreciate it","Thanks for that. Would a £20 one enable him to buy something? I've no idea how the game works so you'll have to excuse me. I know the general premise of amassing your forces and fortifying your castle but I don't know how transactions work in the game? Do you buy units? Or do you buy extra health or something like that? Just want to make sure that he's not going to be stuck having to pay some of his own money in to get anything from the gift?

Thanks","The packs have certain items in them. You can buy building packs that have items to help level up your buildings, or dragon packs to help level up your dragon, etc.","Ok, thanks. So, how much (for instance) is a dragon pack? Or are they different prices? It would be good to give him enough to buy a pack.","They are different prices. The more expensive the pack, the more stuff you get. Like u/rysl31 noted above, they come in those denominations. $20 would be decent.",Great stuff. That's what I'll get then.

Cheers :-),"I think K9 is now K375 or K374, of which I am in both. ;)",Quit this awful game.,"Make a bunch of unbound alts during building and research events. You can get food and wood from them.

Short answer, spend about $50 on the tobho architect pack ($30) and the whent level 15 set. 

They are trying to hook you in, you need to either spend money or invest a few careful weeks of shields and research.","There is no setting that can do this, however there are 1 week shields, if you don’t have one from a free offer WB gives out occasionally, then you can buy one from the store, this will be your best option.","I agree with /u/Howard_duck1.  Either a looooong shield or, if your kingdom offers it, a white flag.  Our kingdom offers white flags for those who need to be away for rl situations such as hospitalization, a death in the family, or military deployment.  Those under white flags are expected to port to a specific island, change their flag to all white, and not act to grow their keep.  It is not fail-safe, but a chance at reprieve.",If you say you are sick and put up a white flag... no one should attack you,Thank you very much!,"Thank you. I will check if my kingdom have something similar. On the other hand, I just checked in the store like  [/u/Howard\_duck1](https://www.reddit.com/u/Howard_duck1/) suggested, but the longest avaiable shield is only 24 hours. I had a look also on the available packages and it seems that no shields are offered. Am I doing something wrong?

Thank you.",Where to say that? In the Kingdom Chat? It would get quickly lost.,Of course (:,"Hmm... you aren’t doing anything wrong, maybe it’ll just come around eventually, the store is random so...","The packs rotate based on the events.  Check on them a few times a day until you find what you need.  If the pack you really want is too expensive, give it about 12 hours and a smaller/lower cost version should show up.","Most kingdoms have a discord server. 
1. Ask someone in your kingdom for the discord invite link, join the server
2. Find a white flag channel
3. Post a screenshot of you player power, etc with a caption like ""hey guys, going into an operation tmrw, and idk how long ill be away.""..... i doubt anyone will question it
4. Go on vacation

There is a section to put your account for sale.  Its more active there then here on reddit.,"Pretty much only buy special event packs. Not the usual ones that are always floating around (Gold pack, Building pack, Research pack ... these are very poor value).

During building events you can buy Advanced Building Materials Packs. These are crucial for progressing to higher level keeps and troops as they are the best (cheapest) source of keystones 

The other important thing to do to progress is farm a lot of caravans like brick and pine. So the gold daily delivery packs are very popular to finance the stamina needed for farming","the system for sure tracks what you spend on packs, ie if you start buying 99$ packs only 99$ and 49$ packs will show up with the occasional 19$ and once in a blue moon a 9$.
I 100% agree with drflip, other than the initial Trobhos 19$ pack the only packs really worth it are the event packs, your standard day to say are a rip off, money spent to rss/speed ups so on gained. but the event packs o' lordy some of them are damned sweet. generally I only buy the 99$ packs because they have the best value but its not always the most cost effective idea, ramen noodles is occasionally part of my diet between pay checks is all I'm saying.
-Thorbies Hand, K360, FQall T3/council, 4th kingdom",resource packs are the best imo. Whatever gets you to t8+ troops the fastest. This game is pretty PTW,"Do special event packs in this game give you second builders and reseachers? I liked be able to research more than one thing at a time, as well as building more than one thing at a time.","Yeah, my rationale for spending is one, some people spend money on weed, cigarettes, alcohol, junk food, I buy packs. Also, I work hard for my money and can afford too. If I spend more than I budgeted for, I simply cut back in other areas to balance my budget.","Yes. The advanced building packs give second builders, advanced research gives second maesters and so forth. They are basically supercharged versions of the regular packs you’d see outside the events

EDIT: I stand corrected. Just checked and the advanced building pack does not give second builders. But over time, I can assure you that you will accumulate plenty of those. The difficult resources are keystones and red gold flakes, followed by dragon lore, pine, and shard. These are the things you’ll get much more of out of an event pack.","What about cheap packs in the beginning til I wait for the special event packs. Is it worth it to spend say a $100 then wait?   


Also, what's the pricing guide? Does it slowly go up, or is there three set prices like in FFXV ANE ($4.99, $19.99, $99).","I wouldn't drop 99$ unless its an event pack, maybe buy a 19$ or 2 to tie you over until an event, this game is really good about frequent events to keep its players engaged","When you start a new game, there are 2 $20 packs that give you a huge head start. They are the $20 Architects pack (3 x Tobo pieces) and the Whent pack with 3x level 15 whent pieces. 

Beyond that no need to buy a pack at first. 

Later on, if you’re putting money in it’s essential to set a budget. Within that, $100 packs are actually significantly more valuable than say 2x 50 packs. That’s not to say you only buy 100 packs, but for something ongoing like building or research it makes sense to make one larger investment than a series of smaller ones"
