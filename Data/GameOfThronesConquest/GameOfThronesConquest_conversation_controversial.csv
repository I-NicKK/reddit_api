You just bubble or hide all the time and hope no one notices you.

I find the game is more fun if you just don't have troops, forget about progression and just dick around until someone quits and gives you their account. That's probably the best way to play for free.","Playing for a year and a half and being keep level 15 is a little bit insane. 

How can you progress if you can’t have more than a certain amount of resources on hand? Save them in boxes until you’re ready to upgrade. Patience is really all it takes to be f2p. Not enough bricks to upgrade? Either pay for them, or wait at max 6 days. 

Granted I have been lucky, made friends with stronger players, and stepped my way into one of the biggest alliances in my Kingdom. *The* biggest before the merge. But that’s part of the game. 

I’m K22 in about half the time that you’ve been playing and haven’t spent anything. Patience. I save everything for events, do well, get gold. Get alliance gold. And get boxes. And I don’t touch *any* of them until I’m ready to use them. 

I’ve taken hits early on, and a big one not too long ago. But I’m at a point in the game where I can shield basically constantly. Although even if I wasn’t in a large alliance, WB glitches have had them give out hundreds of thousands of gold. That’s 100 days of shields at least. But most people used them on resources right away. Missing the concept that patience is the best way to free to play. 

In 100 days of not being attackable, you can stockpile every resource but food, which you can box up with expeditions, as well as simply collect crates of it until you need it. 

And that’s a lot more fun, imo, than paying real money for fake money.","At least you're not in my kingdom, where the 6 or so biggest spenders all got together in one allegiance.

I’d just about hit 1 mil in force yesterday after about a month, keep 13 and house level 20 (f2p) when this pvp event started and I lost all my troops which were worth weeks of training time. 

The pvp events encourage to attack houses whether they have resources or not; just for the sake of destroying their troops and gaining more points this way. It’s basically an animal kingdom that encourages the survival of the fittest. Unless you’re in it to win it, you’re out. I don’t think I could like any game THAT much to have such patience and tolerance. And I was extremely frustrated. 

On top of this, my oh-so-supportive allegiance said I should have protected myself, as if the game’s user interface was so great that I was aware of all events all the time and as soon as they started. (I didn’t even realize that this game had events for a week or so until I figured out that little circle on top left corner -which has no title written on it- is the events button) Plus, I don’t have 24 hr shields anymore to protect my place and they are like 1000 golds each. 

Unless I find a peaceful allegiance with a focus on defence and warning each other, having each other’s back, I’m out. In time I’m sure players can get somewhere, I’m just not in a rush for it and don’t want my house to be destroyed because of this.","Agreed, I explained in detail my problems with this game in this thread:

Overnight, all gone by keep 20+","yeah if thats as far as you got in a year and a half, even as f2p...you have some fundamental misunderstandings of the game.

You can buy peace shields with gold, 1k/24hrs to be permanently shielded. Your alliance gifts are important, as are the alliance leaderboard rewards from events. Saving boxed resources, participating in events to whatever degree you can, using all your energy to hit creatures (especially brick/soldiers pine events), constantly have your marches out gathering.

I never farm gold, and shield is my priority expense (I'm literally shielded 90%+ of the time). But I have enough left over to regularly supplement my rss for big builds, and then some.

I lucked into one of the biggest in the kingdom, so I actually have enough coming in from event rewards and allegiance gifts that I can buy 24hr shields constantly and actually gain gold overall, but even a mid-sized allegiance should be enough to pay for your shields, as long as you make that a priority and don't waste your gold on wood and stuff like that.","But of course they don't read. If they did I wouldn't loss all my troops when attacking a Seat of Power with no owner. I'm quite sure it's a bot, not a real person.

I don't recommend the game to anyone. It has a lot of glitches, you can't navigate through the map, you can't hunt, you can't attack, you're not protected since the shield is so invisible that your enemies think they can attack you... And they succeed!

I'm stupid haha.","Hi stupid haha., I'm dad.",I don't have a dad.,Troop load is the stat to look for when trying to determine how many resources can be carried.  You probably aren’t getting any rss because this keeps are at or below their storehouse level so all of the resources you see on those scout reports are protected.,Exactly what the comment above says. If you click on your resources at the top of the screen you'll see what you safe amount is :),"Thank you. I can´t see my troop loads when preparing an attack, so I never thought about it. Now that I made some research, it seems that it´s visible only when gathering resources, right?","That´s a nice tip, thank you :) !","If your actively planning on spending that amount, and aren't commited to any kingdom or alliance. Find a good kingdom and just buy a t9 or t10 keep.  I'd look at kingdoms that recently had their first merge.  You'll save quite a bit and will easily push to the high end of keeps if you spend well.

We're almost a week old though. If you can wait, I can get the code to you within a couple of days or so.",It's around $10k~ plus grinding millions of brick and pine.  Thats not counting the dragon... Or the armory. T9 is around $2-3k.  But on the 2nd hand market you might buy a t9 keep with modest dragon for ~$500 give or take.  T10(weak stats/dragon) for as low as $1500~.  These prices fluctuate and I might be off.  Also there is inherent risk with keep transfers due to fraud and possible 3rd party interference.,Yes. That will totally save you XD,Yes!,Thanks😇,"Pretty much only buy special event packs. Not the usual ones that are always floating around (Gold pack, Building pack, Research pack ... these are very poor value).

During building events you can buy Advanced Building Materials Packs. These are crucial for progressing to higher level keeps and troops as they are the best (cheapest) source of keystones 

The other important thing to do to progress is farm a lot of caravans like brick and pine. So the gold daily delivery packs are very popular to finance the stamina needed for farming","the system for sure tracks what you spend on packs, ie if you start buying 99$ packs only 99$ and 49$ packs will show up with the occasional 19$ and once in a blue moon a 9$.
I 100% agree with drflip, other than the initial Trobhos 19$ pack the only packs really worth it are the event packs, your standard day to say are a rip off, money spent to rss/speed ups so on gained. but the event packs o' lordy some of them are damned sweet. generally I only buy the 99$ packs because they have the best value but its not always the most cost effective idea, ramen noodles is occasionally part of my diet between pay checks is all I'm saying.
-Thorbies Hand, K360, FQall T3/council, 4th kingdom",resource packs are the best imo. Whatever gets you to t8+ troops the fastest. This game is pretty PTW,"Do special event packs in this game give you second builders and reseachers? I liked be able to research more than one thing at a time, as well as building more than one thing at a time.","Yeah, my rationale for spending is one, some people spend money on weed, cigarettes, alcohol, junk food, I buy packs. Also, I work hard for my money and can afford too. If I spend more than I budgeted for, I simply cut back in other areas to balance my budget.","Yes. The advanced building packs give second builders, advanced research gives second maesters and so forth. They are basically supercharged versions of the regular packs you’d see outside the events

EDIT: I stand corrected. Just checked and the advanced building pack does not give second builders. But over time, I can assure you that you will accumulate plenty of those. The difficult resources are keystones and red gold flakes, followed by dragon lore, pine, and shard. These are the things you’ll get much more of out of an event pack.","What about cheap packs in the beginning til I wait for the special event packs. Is it worth it to spend say a $100 then wait?   


Also, what's the pricing guide? Does it slowly go up, or is there three set prices like in FFXV ANE ($4.99, $19.99, $99).","I wouldn't drop 99$ unless its an event pack, maybe buy a 19$ or 2 to tie you over until an event, this game is really good about frequent events to keep its players engaged","When you start a new game, there are 2 $20 packs that give you a huge head start. They are the $20 Architects pack (3 x Tobo pieces) and the Whent pack with 3x level 15 whent pieces. 

Beyond that no need to buy a pack at first. 

Later on, if you’re putting money in it’s essential to set a budget. Within that, $100 packs are actually significantly more valuable than say 2x 50 packs. That’s not to say you only buy 100 packs, but for something ongoing like building or research it makes sense to make one larger investment than a series of smaller ones","I play in K371 and when I first started it was suggested that you research military book first. If you play your cards right, you can build up your keep to about 12-14 without buying packs. It is nice to get into a liege right away.  As the bigger people buy packs,you get gifts from these packs. Some of these gifts will be coin which is important as you grow bigger. The other advantage of being in a liege is people look out for your stuff and each liege has a discord channel so they can warn you when your bubble is down or whatever may be going on.  It is hard to be aggressive when you are a small. Once you reach keep 22 you can make T8 troops which will allow you to become more aggressive especially if you make the right equipment for the troop type you like best.",I love the game. Especially when you get in with a great group of people.  I’ve been playing for 2 years now.,"I've been playing for over a year now and have rerolled into a new kingdom so my best advice would be to find some folks you got along with in your old playthrough and take them with you, if this isn't possible, say you didn't play enough to really get to know people, I would say find an alliance with some people that know what they are doing as soon as you can, that way you can take advantage and learn from them from the jump. Packs early on I would say definetly get the $19.99 Trobhos with all 3 pieces, between that pack and even without patience you can get to T6 troops in a matter of hours. I would definetly wait until the first Varys event to buy any other packs or build too much. one thing you will learn from rerolling is that you know a ton more about early game then you think you do and things will progress and build up much much faster for you, my first time through it took me 6 months and thousands of dollars to reach T9s and break 50 million total points. my current play through ive spent maybe 2k already have T9s and am sitting at 70 million already after maybe 3 months of play time.
be aggressive! be be AGGRESSIVE! especially early game the amount of people that open all their RSS and have literally millions just sitting there for you to take is glorious!
-Thorbies Hand, K360, T3/council FQall","Right off the bat I’d join a good alliance where I can get lots of gifts, obviously get alliance event rewards, during Varys events I create farm account, gets around 3-4 million rss total, really nice for keep 17-20 or so, save gold for when I need it the most, don’t rush Troops or gear with gold, pretty much same thing I do in other accounts just don’t make the stupid mistakes I’ve made before haha.","I would join a fresh kingdom, if you join an established one you will always be playing catch up. Focus your resources more on building than troops. Under T8 is irrelevant and in most kingdoms you need T10 to really do anything. You will not build a Keep from new to T10 without spending money. You cannot play effectively being free to play in any kingdom. The downside of the game is it is pay to play and someone will always pay more than you. I know many people who have spent $5-$8k in the 2 years the game has been out. I’m sure there are people who spent more but won’t admit it. If you choose to spend then spend smart. I buy packs now and then to get things I cannot get in the game easily, like keystones. For example upgrading K27 to K28 takes about 457mil wood, 457mil food, 36mil Stone, 10.5mil iron, 42,000 brick, 16,000 pine, and 5,100 keystones. And that is a JUST keep 27 to 28, not allll the building upgrades you need between which there are many. In the beginning it’s days or weeks per Keep upgrade. After K20 or so it becomes months, and over 26 can take 6mo-yr to upgrade to next Keep unless you spend A LOT of $ to speed it up.","1.	join kingdom first days it opens
2.	get the building/training/healing gear set early (whent/tobo/relic)
3.	join a strong allegiance 
4.	make farm alts 
5.	Prioritise farming caravans (brick Shard etc) actually the cheapest and beneficial way to progress, house level become important for gear. Use gold for stamina
6.	Build lean and focus on keystones through advanced building packs during events if you spend. 
7.	learn the maths. Eg you can create a collection lvl 120+ armory set for monthly gear for free once you’re at house 35.
8.	do the military and logistics research, only focused advanced military. As you progress military II is a lot cheaper than advanced military
9.	complete your daily tasks! 
10. Only build enough troops to farm at each new tier level until you reach your goal tier, then go crazy training. 

And most importantly be safely bubbled assiduously until you know you’re untouchable. I’m 90+ million power on one server but still bubble when asleep","Focus on 1 troop type, stack up its stats. 2nd troop type with decent stats. I would do infantry then cavs. But Range also have fun cause of a lot of Cav fans","If I could do it over I would put everything into getting k26 as soon as possible. No messing about training 2M T8'S, i'd blast straight past them & only spend on packs that would help me to 26. Save all that RSS for upgrades.

I would have started farming alts earlier. If you can get into one of top alliances & they are nice enough to let you keep some alts the gifts and event rewards really stack up. I got 150M food and wood, 3mil iron and about 150k gold total (im a t3 so this was from 5 alts) <- probably saved me $150 or more towards the final keep upgrade. all you gotta do is make sure you log in to them every 2 days to collect the gifts. 

Be active and chat to the people you play with, that's my second point of advice, best thing about this game are the friends you make and kicking ass as a team

3rd The Armoury is huge in this game for boosting your stats... for reference a lvl 40 yellow Kings Guard piece can yield around a +50% infantry attack boost when placed in your armoury.",Well we can get you friend codes too so let me know if ya need one.,"Thanks for answering, instead of that one person that had a shit time saying, ""quit.""",I had a great time playing for the two weeks that I did before I came out here.

That or just go it alone and invite him later on.,"I'm not trying to be a smart ass, but should I simply not build until the Varys event, or just build each building up a level or two?","How good does the gold get because in FFXV: ANE, gold is one of the most precious rss because people need it to train large amounts of troops and fast track the buildings.

So I *assume* that training troops isn't all that hard?","you could always look into buying a pre-built up account in an older kingdom, then you wont have to play as much catch up other than the obvious learning curve, which is something you are likely to run into anyway seeing as people reroll so frequently",There is someone on one of my servers who openly admits having spent over 100k USD on their account 🙈,How easy is it to make alts in this game?

My advice/ recommendations:
1. Don't spend money until you know how it works. (I just replaced my phone and I didn't save my game so I'm starting over. HA Ha.)Or at least set a budget of in app purchases for the month.

2. Join an allegiance. (You get free gifts but some people take this game super seriously so sometimes a mixed blessing.) You will never know how serious your allegiance is until you join. They may ask you to participate in the Discord app. Again, you don't know until you try. Personally, I din't take this game that seriously and work full time...., some people who play...,,  idk how they expect people to participate like its a job. 

3. Do the daily tasks. Collect daily rewards. Train your troops. Upgrade your buildings. Do research. Do the challenges. (Quests)

4. Hunt creatures as much as possible. See what the maximum level you can attack and defeat with your troops. If you have a lot of troops reinforce someone on your allegiance with half of them. You will constantly get attcked so be ready for all your troops to die.

5. Check in and get your free gifts. (Look at the messages.)

The merge however is permanent. Perhaps that’s the confusion.,Permanent.

Anyone saying this game is a black hole for money is forgetting the fact that you can simply choose not to pay anything and still play.

Just play smart. Dragon feeding events come about every two weeks, and you can earn a whole lot of lore (and keystones) with those. Plus, your rewards will also include better food and extra feeds for the next time around.

So just be smart, keep an eye on when you’re going to have to upgrade your dragon, and if you don’t have enough lore, wait for an event. Skip feeding for a few days now, to avoid missing feeding while your dragon is ready to upgrade. Get the daily bonus, but otherwise wait for the event. Then do the feeding, get the lore, boom you’re ready to upgrade. 

Dragon research also uses lore. And you might be tempted to blow through a bunch of those while a research event is going on. But if you don’t leave enough to upgrade, you can get yourself in trouble. 

Right now you’re in a worst case scenario. You don’t have enough lore to upgrade, and since you’re stuck there, you can’t get lore through feeding events. Your only option is to get your daily lore, and maybe keep an eye out for other events that you can do that reward lore. And just next time keep an eye on how close you are to upgrading, and hold back for a feeding event instead of feeding right away if you don’t have enough.","I didn’t spend any money but I did spend gold to upgrade my dragon the first time.

How soon do they open a new one?,I keep seeing people asking. Why not just make one yourself?,It’s already made. This post is 4 days old.,"What are you attacking? If you’re attacking creatures, by all means use your boosted archers. If you’re attacking other players, try to set up a rally so that you send all of your boosted archers, someone else will have cav gear and send cav, someone else will have infantry gear and send infantry. 

If you’re not in a coordinated alliance, it is better to send troops proportional to the weaknesses of those you’re attacking, rather than just one troop type. 

For example, if the person you want to attack has 50k infantry and 5k each of cav and range then send mostly your range and send a few infantry and cavalry to deal with the rest. 

On the other hand if they’re all cavalry, you don’t want to send any range even though they have better stat boosts. You’re better off sending infantry.","Hi mate,

Thanks for the response, this makes sense and this is what we do in my allegiance. While attacking big keeps, we always send our highest boosted troops and make sure we co-ordinate this for SOPs too. 

My question is more for when I solo keeps. Not the massive ones, but ones that just about in my range. The same question above works. Isn't there a tipping point where if you're fighting 50k cav (and nothing else), it might just make more sense to send all your highly boosted ranged instead of sending infantry that isn't boosted much?","But what if your cav stats are significantly better than your inf/range? Then wouldn't it be better to send all cav?

I read somewhere that troop triangle only gives about a 10% advantage.","If you specialized in ranged, just send your range. Sending a mix weakens your March. You did all that work to make your archers powerful, use them. Only mix if you’re sending siege to kill traps.

I did some tests with a friend from a diff allegiance and my ranged fared better against cav than my infantry.","Most people in my kingdom start by specializing in one troop type. Crafting gear for it, loading the armory, getting a title from a seat if power, etc. 

If you have the ability to, don’t neglect the other troop types.

- Resources - don’t have more resources than your protected amount, unless you are shielded or are about to use them. Leave them in crates in your inventory. 

- War Camps & Medic Tents - have as many as you can. This will let you train a lot of troops and when they get injured, more of them will survive in the tents. Don’t keep attacking someone/somewhere if your medic tents are full unless you want your troops to die, when there’s no space they just die. 

- Armour - have a few sets of armour for different reasons. I have training, march size, cav attack and healing. They’re each going to help ie. extra troops trained and cost reduced, bigger march size, better cav attack and reduced healing cost. Obviously all of these aren’t needed to start but I’d say have a training and a healing set. 

- Research - do it. It may seem like an expensive use of resources but it’ll help. Sorry but I can’t remember more about research. 

- Dragon - they were introduced when I was already K22 so I have no idea what to do with a dragon in the early game. 

- Shield - be in a shield unless you want to get hit. People will be less likely to attack if you have no resources over the protected amount but anyone could be a target. 

- Alliance - find a good group of people to join up with. They’ll make the game more fun and will help you grow.",Start collecting bricks early .. you'll thank yourself later in the game.,"Thanks.

3.) a bubble is a peace shield. If you have one up you can’t be attacked. They cost 800 gold for 8 hours, or 1,000 gold for 24 hours. 
4.) attack creatures for crafting materials and basic resource boxes. When the brick event is on collect bricks, when pine is on collect pine. Attacking players or SOPs do not cost any stamina so you can do that as much or as little as you’d like. If you want to upgrade your your buildings you’ll need to train enough troops and start farming keeps
5.)  by completing the events that they have. Getting as high of a rank as you can to get better rewards. Join a larger alliance so you can get the alliance rewards and the alliance gifts as well. Best way to get resources is by farming other players and taking their resources or by buying packs(I know it sucks and is expensive)
6.) my rule of thumb is ALWAYS have a peace shield up. Those cost gold. Best way to spend gold. Next, spend it on random or advanced ports to farm for rss. Once you are a higher keep level you’re going to be short on bricks, pine and keystones. Bricks and pine can be farmed in their special days. 1 pine cost 50 gold. If you spend 700 gold on stamina you can hunt 5-600 pine. Much more efficient than spending the gold to just outright buy the pine or brick.",I’m not sure I understand the question.

10 million troop power you can beat t8 rallys but will quickly lose if not awake.

I'm assuming you're talking about discord.

Find out if your spy has access to all the rooms in the server, or maybe just the main chat. Restrict access if you have to.

2nd. Once you figure out where the spy is, leak "" fake "" information. And do your best to keep tabs on who says what. If something fishy goes down, then you can narrow your idea of who it is.

Lastly. this is a Golden rule. Always ASSUME you have a spy in your server. That way people have to think about what and where they are posting.

Most spies generally don't talk much in chat and hardly contribute to the allegiance (intel or inputs about making power plays).

I don't know how big your allegiance is... But this is what I'd do with my old allegiance ( I recently left a super allegiance to be back with old friends and teammates )

Screen EVERY SINGLE PERSON that you send a disco link to. If you're able to get an idea say between... 5 possibly people that are they spy. Give each one different information, and whichever one gets leaked, you know exactly who that was.

So this is probably misdiagnosed. Perhaps there was an event that ended that gave a boost to her favorite troop type.

In general though the recommended troops will be cav for attacking. So maybe she has cav boosts, but her formation isn’t full of cavalry.

You won’t be able to take the seat until all troops reinforcing are killed and the wall is at 0%.  You can solo any seat if the reinforcements are low enough.  The best way to attack lockable seats is to have the attacker titles from smaller seats.  So for a 2.5 star seat you’d want the attacker title that comes from a 2 star seat and so on.  If the seat is full you’ll need rallies unless the reinforcements aren’t active and you’re willing to lose a lot of troops.  Double dip by starting your marches/rallies with your march size gear and then switching to the gear best suited to your troop type immediately after.  Use attack, defense, health and march size boosts if you’re going up against larger amounts of reinforcements.","The answer tends to vary depending on your particular situation, for instance are you looking at attacking an unlocking sop ie controlled by the computer or a player controlled sop? both answers are drastically different. typically if its a player controlled sop that is unreined you will be able to do it solo all you need is siege but if it gets reinforced you may or may not depending on the troop count that is put in by the alliance holding it. typically speaking if they are trying to actively defend the sop unless you are significantly stronger solo than the entire alliance that is defending you will be unable to solo such a sop. if the sop however is about to unlock I believe T6 troops are high enough power with a full march to eventually take the sop, obviously the stronger your troops the faster they can knock down the walls. that being said only an unoccupied sop ie controlled by the computer can have  the walls taken down by troops player controlled sops the walls have to be taken down by siege.

I focused infantry so my gear is infantry right now. I wouldn’t build many troops until you have t7 troops.

Get to k19 and you’ll be fine,"When it comes to gathering resource nodes the recommended amount of troops should be the minimum to gather all in one march assuming you have enough troops to do that. the fastest troop type is cavalry so they will get to and from nodes quicker. the highest load capacity type is siege. but they are mirror opposites. focus on a single troop type instead of training top tier of all three simply makes it easier to gear for a particular type of troop fully rather than having to mix and match pieces to help all your troops. no matter what I would always have all of your troop makers training troops I would just recommend to have the 2 that are not your main focus training lower tiers to help form a meatshield to protect your keep while your marches are out, the most optimal method I have found is to focus your highest tier, gear, enhancements and research on a single troop type to the best of your ability. that being said the easiest T9s to get are infantry as barracks is already 25 in order to get keep 26. but infantry are weak against ranged so if your opponent focus on ranged you will be at a disadvantage from major to slight depending on the respective Tiers and gear for your troops.

This game is a money pit","Max farms, max lumbermills, 7-8 each med tents and war camps, 2 or 3 each of quarry and mine.

I found early on that I needed more wood so I had more lumbermills, later in game I found I needed more food so now I have more farms. regardless I always recommend the maximum number of medical tents, this allows you to have more wounded troops that can be healed vs troops outright dying, as you level up if you need to I recommend deleting other selectable building to ensure max medical tents, war camps are another that I highly recommend you have as many as you can, they allow you to train more troops which in turn allows you to have a greater army, regardless of your play style you will need an army this is game of thrones after all not Farmville. lastly I recommend at least one of each resource generator, you will need a minimum of one so that you can meet requirements for upgrading other buildings, trust me it really blows to have to wait to build up say a quarry from level 1 to level 24 just to upgrade your keep to 25. other than those 3 pieces of advice I always tell people as I said that your extra spaces are situational.

At the start it was a bit fun with everyone being low level and an active community but the reality of the game is much like Game Of Thrones, those who can afford to have the gold and wealth control the game. 

It's a shameless cashgrab of a game where progression becomes quickly impossible without paying. 

At a certain point you will be forced to constantly have shields up (which you buy with real money) otherwise you will be destroyed and lose all of your progress. 

Every single aspect of this game is P2W, there is no skill involved and no option for F2P progression. 

Just to put into perspective how expensive this game is, it costs roughly $120,000 US to max your account. 

My best friend in game spent over $400,000 to get 5 almost maxed accounts.

I was in the top alliance worldwide only because I had made friends early on that were willing to spend thousands to get good, they protected me for a long time but they could only do so much until I forgot to put a shield on one day and lost all of my progress.

I was considered a very light spender and I still dished out over $500 on the game. 

It's manipulative by nature, do yourself a favor and DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME.

Edit: it's deceptively easy at first and it will seem that you never have to spend money, that phase quickly dissappears and you're in a corner, either spend the money or die and lose your progress.","If you 1.Earn in dollars or euro and/or 2. Have enough actual money to spend on a mobile game, go for it. Otherwise its a waste of time. No way you can actually enjoy the game when competing against people that spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a *mobile game*.","To give a different perspective I have spent $0 on this game and I’m in the top alliance of a mature kingdom. I’m competitive and useful in my alliance with t8s. I spend no money and very little energy on this game. It’s fun to play on the toilet or in bed. It does exactly what I want, therefor, for a mobile game. 

In the beginning it was more stressful making sure I wasn’t about to be attacked. That’s true. But now I have enough gold from events to keep myself shielded indefinitely. And I have a big enough meat shield that I can’t be attacked without an enemy team coordinating a huge rally for me. I have teammates in the game who are pretty chill. I get on, see if they’re up to anything, build some troops, do the events. It’s fun and relaxing, and, again, I haven’t spent a cent. 

Of course in every kingdom there’s going to be someone willing to pay thousands and thousands for the digital privilege of being top dogs. But they don’t have absolute power. Far from it. 

I know a lot of people will disagree. And I’m sure there’s more people who start, get disheartened by spenders, and get out before they’re over the hump. But for my perspective, as a f2p player over the hump, it’s an enjoyable and passive game that’s fun to pull up when I’m bored.","I play it and enjoy it.

Google/Andriod do NOT do this, so it gives Apple users a distinct advantage if they do this.
Numerous people from all kingdoms have investigated & provided proof of this to WB & WB claims to be ""working to put an end to it"", but they do nothing.

That's a picture from two days ago, my friend that I played with two years ago got his 80m keep 26 leveled by the enemy in the picture, there's way more enemies than you can see in the screenshot. 



If you think you are safe with t8's boy do I have some news for you.","There are endless reasons why this game is terrible, the only reason anyone ever played is because it has the Game of Thrones name.","The pleasure is all mine, it's an awful game and your time and money is better spent elsewhere :)","Bricks becomes an issue pretty quickly, but those can be obtained from the events, again you can only get so many before you run out of attacks on monsters. Keystones are going to be the next issue and those are even more expensive than bricks. Sounds like you're pretty close to the pay or die stage. 

Depending on the politics in your kingdom it could be different, our kingdom was extremely political and because of competition between rival alliances, it quickly became the most stacked kingdom in the game in terms of power. There are people in my old alliance with almost 1B power on one account. Without 3ER it's hard to know exactly how much the whole alliance has, but it's easily over 10B total power. In younger Kingdoms you probably won't have to play against such stacked players, but in every kingdom rivalries develop eventually, and rivalries lead to players trying to outspend the other, just driving the power cap in the Kingdom higher up.

I used to make alliances and get good players to join us so that's what kept me in the strongest alliance, but that also put a massive target on my head. Both teams used bots to know when the enemy teams bubbles dropped, so if I didn't have a shield for more than 5-10 minutes I would get zeroed. 

You probably aren't in the position I was in, but it can turn into that at the blink of an eye and it's out of your control. 

We had treaties and I was safe for a long time, I didn't need to use a bubble, but all it takes is one idiot to start attacking the enemy teams lower levels.",I have played so many games in my lifetime and I have never encountered a game that shamelessly wants your money as much as this one.,"Like I said, no matter how much someone pays, they don’t have absolute power. I use peace shields.

Also by the sound of it my kingdom is far, far younger. 

And, like I also said already, I can only be successfully attacked with a rally. And that’s what you showed me a picture of. So this is far from a “i hate to break it to you” situation...","I regret ever putting any money into this game, because now I feel like if I abandon my account & stop playing, I'm throwing all that money away, but really I've already thrown it away. I used to hope that the game would get better, that they would fix the bugs and enhance the game & find ways to balance out the extremely uneven power levels in their kingdoms, but it's become clear over the years that this just simply will not happen.
It's also extremely frustrating to try to contact support. They typically do not respond to ANY ticket unless you hound them with email after email after email, and even then, you *have* to say ""I spent real money on this game"" before they will even look at your email.
It also doesn't seem like anyone from the game developers team actually plays the game at all. They release patch notes saying an issue is fixed when it is not fixed. They change basic game mechanics and offer no notice to players or explanations of the changes made or reason behind them.",">	 Keystones are going to be the next issue and those are even more expensive than bricks. Sounds like you're pretty close to the pay or die stage.

I don’t see why that’s “pay or die” and not “pay or wait a couple weeks.” 

Bricks and pine are easy to come by each week. Keystones are a headache, but there are events all the time that reward them. My level 21 wall and 22 keep did take me a *long* time to get enough keystones. 

But that’s my point, people think it’s “pay or die” but patience cures so many of the woes of free to play. Patience to save boosts, boxes, speed ups, etc. and patience to wait for keystone events to go all out on. 

It would not be a fun challenge, nor a worthwhile accomplishment, if every material required were simply heaved at you by the time you could possibly need it. If the building time was the only thing slowing you down before building the next thing for the *whole game* that’s a timer app.","Lol rallies are not exactly rare, once people get organized on discord properly, you'll see teams of 20 t'10s soon enough. 

And sure peace shields work but it only takes 1 day of being busy and man does that suck, I had a shield consistently for about 6 months until I was on a date and forgot about the game, a year of progress and building just gone like that, kinda sucks imo.","Do yourself a favor and quit, the money is gone and isn't coming back.",A couple weeks costs 14k gold in shields though. Isn't there a point at which patience becomes too expensive?,"I refresh my shield when I wake up. Part of my morning poop routine lol. I have vacations planned, but I also have saved up multi day shields from server issues etc that WB handed out to everyone. 

Is there a chance that some day I will accidentally let my shield expire? Yes. It has happened before and will happen again. But since the strongest enemy players in my kingdom can only hit me with a fraction of my power per match, it will take a rally for any real damage to be done. 

The chances that they will find me on a day that I’m late to refresh and organize a rally on me before I get to it are low. Not impossible though. And if it happens I might walk away from the game. But as I’ve invested $0 and gotten hours of fun out of it, I would be fine with that. 

My other option is to act like something that could possibly maybe one day happen has already happened, and walk away right now. And I just don’t see the point in that. Sounds like a bad way to think about it and I’m glad my brain doesn’t stop me from doing things based on low-chance no-loss scenarios.","I'm very dubious about all of them, t8's alone is pretty impossible without spending, and you're making it seem like you're 50m power which again is pretty impossible without spending.

All these shields and gold you seem to have don't really add up, I'm calling bullshit on either what you are saying about your actual game and keep or that you don't spend, just doesn't add up.","I leveraged my position in one alliance to get into the top alliance in my original kingdom. After a kingdom merge we still come in second or at worst third in all events.

On top of that I save everything. Literally every boost, box, builder, speed up, etc. when the events are on that’s when I use them. I’m usually top 20 except for ones that require a lot of spending. 

All of that adds up. 

On top of that I can make 10k power in 5 and a half hours of training at every one of my troop buildings. So that’s 40k power about three times a day or 120k power a day, and usually one more before I go to bed that I collect when I wake up. Essentially 160k power a day plus whatever odds and ends upgrades I get like gear or research. And that’s without boosts. When there are troop training events on I can get several times that per day. But outside of troop training days I can get training done with only the occasional farm plot boosts with four marches out gathering, full level 22 farms, and the odd prayer candle. 

I’m not quite to fifty million power yet, but I really don’t see how you think that’s out of the question because I’ll be there in under a month *and* would have been already if it weren’t for some setbacks like seats I was reining getting rallied, etc.

And I haven’t even been playing for a full year yet.

Plus WB gave everyone 100k gold *twice* for glitches. 

T8’s are factually not impossible without spending. I don’t even have a card linked to iTunes. Maybe it’s impossible for you, but many have done it, I’m sure I’m far from the first.","There are hundreds of Kingdoms that people are in, so you may want to include your Kingdom information.

Cavalry is the fastest moving between your keep and a resource node.
Siege has the biggest load capacity.
if you are talking more about resource farming from other players, definitely do not use siege. you will knock their walls down and that give them a free random teleport and free 24hr protection bubble.

-Breezestreak
K274, T2 0FQs","Cavalry will always gather resources the quickest because cavalry troops have the highest speed of any type. The trade-off is that their troop load isn't very impressive, so you have to have a large enough march size to gather all of the resources in a node to maximize their efficiency.",Cavalry is fastest.,Thanks! Very handy,"That’s going to be an extra large no. You will need something like 65million food for keep level 22. And just look at the later research tasks, many of them require millions and millions of food each. Save your boxes.","Keep your resources boxed until right when you are going to use them. If you farm more food than your protected amount, use it ASAP to train troops. Only food gets depleted by the hour if you have over the protected amount. However if you have over the protected amt of wood/iron/stone those can be stolen if you get attacked. I would suggest focusing all your boxed resources on upgrading buildings. Keep 22 gets you T8, keep 26 gets you T9, and 30 gets you T10. Anything under T8 becomes pretty useless quickly. You WILL run out of Brick, Pine, and keystone very quickly. Use the troops you have to farm as many brick/pine caravans as possible. Better to spend gold on stamina than to buy brick/pine for an upgrade. I’m working on keep 28 and it’s insane how much you need. Over 400 million food/wood, 30k brick, 12k pine. Craft good gear sets to (1) increase training capacity/speed (2) boost March size (3) healing cost efficiency (4) construction speed (5) steel/crafting efficiency (Whent gear is good for 3,4,5) Later you can work on different troop attack gear. Equip the right gear set before you do something. Training boost gear on before you train troops, ect. You won’t get far without spending $$$ in this game sadly. You can get to maybe 22-24 without spending if you play smart. After that you spend or wait a year to save up rss. Join a good alliance and get on the game Discord servers for tips. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.","that is a big yes my friend. in short order you will need considerably more resources than can be protected in your storehouse.

K274, T2 0FQs","Oh I know that, I just meant should I be saving any of the protected amounts for anything? I was thinking of just spending constantly to get troops and then use a shite ton of boxes at once to upgrade past the protected amount. Does that seem about right? I only ask because my troop cost will definitely get to above what I make, but that's fine as long as it isn't over my capacity (unprotected, etc) and I know only to use boxes when I really have to for upgrades",How often are you raiding/farming other keeps in order to keep up with the rss costs? And do you shield every time you are away from your phone to prevent from getting farmed yourself. I'm at Keep 15 right now and I'm already nervous holding on to 5-6M rss.,"What I like to do if I have a research that requires say 2 million food is max out my protected food on hand, let my farms get full, and time that with troops returning from gathering food. Then I usually don’t have to open many boxes at all, if any. 

It’s tricky timing, but you’ll always want to be conservative with boxes because the upgrades eventually get insane.","If you have something to steal someone will take it. It depends on the kingdom. On mine it use to be 20mil + power and no one would attack you. Now you have to be over 50 mil. I am almost always shielded when I’m sleeping. Sometimes during the day if I won’t be on my phone much. If you are keep 15 you don’t need a ton of rss for each upgrade so I’d spend them as soon as you can to upgrade something. If you don’t have a bunch of rss or troops no point in shielding. I have a good chart on building upgrade orders to grow more efficiently. I’ll make a post with it in this sub. I highly recommend focusing on upgrades over troops until you are at least T8.

Anyone in that enemy alliance can send reinforcement troops. Likely their will be too many troops in there for you to solo attack it, you will need to rally. 

Mormont gear is great for rallying SoPs all kinds of good boosts. So first scout figure out what level troops, what type, and how many. Then get some friends and send some rally at it to kill the troops, advice different types of troops are weaker against different types of troops.

once all the troops defending are dead you will need to send siege to break down the wall. Only send siege troops once all defending troops are dead. Once the wall percentage hits 0% send a attack but click “take over” this time. Who ever send that March first gets the SoP.","There is a dramatic difference between player and NPC held sops.
for NPC held sops there are no troops inside, and your troops can damage the walls, basically attack away and eventually it will be yours.
For player controlled sops more than likely there will be troops inside so you first have to kill the troops then you can start on the walls. use troops to kill troops and siege to break walls. but be aware that if its a player controlled sop they will be notified as will anyone that has reinforcements inside, so they can come online and refresh their reinforcements.
easiest way to take a sop from a player with a minimal of losses would be to rally it with your own alliance mates. but since the game now notifies when a rally is set against a player they will likely know, come online and defend.
also note the game is very defensive based so while your attacking troops are more likely to die during the assault the defenders will be wounded until medical tents are filled up. if the player you are attacking comes online they can speed heal their troops using healing boosts and basically have an endless supply of troops while your own troops slowly die off or rapidly die off if you happen to be hitting outside of your weight class to speak

In new kingdoms, they do staggered releases of SOP openings, typically every weekend or every other weekend until all the regions are open (with the exception of Pyke & the Night's Watch castles on The Wall which have their own opening events & different structure than the regular SOPs). If you want to know when a specific SOP will open in your kingdom, you could contact Support and ask, but idk what kind of response you'd get.
SOP warfare is now much more efficient with the recent mechanics changes (a couple months ago), so expect SOPs to change hands much more frequently during their unlock periods - at least, that's what I've seen in my kingdom so far (originally K10, merged to K113, then merged to current kingdom K291).","Yeah it’s Apple, I had to confirm my purchases with them when using my card in apps (:","If it’s not your card, it’s probably Apple.

1 is to use an item of the same level, IE you can use a level 5 item to craft a level 5 item, I would advise against this approach unless you are making a different item entirely as using this method doesn't usually give good results for making higher quality gear.
2 would be to spend real life money to get in game gold which can be used to purchase gear templates for any quality and any level that you have unlocked. personally I would only use this method infrequently or for high level gear, and always for yellow quality when I have a 100% chance of crafting yellow quality, its very cost inefficient otherwise

K274, T2 0FQS","It’s the maximum power level that a creature will have. There are other things to consider though, some creatures have a Rock Paper Scissors sort of strength and weakness, so the wight for example is weak against ranged but strong against cavalry (I think. Correct me if I’m wrong) so even if you have a higher power level, if any of that is made up of something it’s strong against you might lose. Of course your own power level is also representative and doesn’t tell the whole story. If you have 20% boosts to every stat, your 1mil power will be worth more than someone else’s 1mil power even if it’s exactly the same. Power is just a general representation of a lot of factors, and shouldn’t be relied on to be exact. You have to consider various strengths, weaknesses, amounts, modifiers, etc.","basically when you are looking at the screen that shows the creature and gives you the option to march/attack you will see just above the button a number, lvl 7 wight should be somewhere around 200k I believe, don't quote me on that number though, so basically when you go to attack you need your march strength to be higher than the creature strength to almost guarantee a win. note that it almost gurantees a win, as kentonj stated certain creatures have weaknesses and strengths so if you attack a creature that is weak to infantry with all infantry you will do better even attacking from a spot of weakness march power wise. the inverse of this however is true when attacking a creature that has a type advantage over you. you may have the stronger march but they can still beat you.
chance to drop amount is essentially the chance the creature will drop items or certain items. certain creatures, like brick caravans, are guaranteed to drop certain items, in this example brick caravans are guaranteed to drop brick, the amount they drop however varies

Save your dragon lore and focus on combat stats.  Ignore all the dragon-gathering nonsense.,"so there are different trains of thought for the dragon.
a very popular school of thought is spend the points as you get them then reset each time you unlock the next level of dragon and re-spec but this could cost a significant amount of gold to do.
another method is to spec for what you need, again using all the points as you earn them. for example one of the trees is dedicated to resources while another is all about using your dragon to fight other players.
personally I waited to spec for attacking until I was able to use my dragon to attack other players. so early on I had my dragon spec'd to help with resource gathering and generation.

1 they are debuffed, meaning they do less damage and take more damage

if you don't know what kind of troops you are attacking send your strongest troops or scout first to get an idea

once all troops are dead in your target then send in siege to take down walls

Gear is also important,if you use cavalry I'd reccomend the saddle trinket,that also increases troop load :)","Increase your troop load with research, gear, and upgrades.","As you play your March speed will increase and so will your troop load, and you’ll get more marches. Sending four marches at once with fast troops that can carry a lot of rss is a world of difference from slowly grabbing a few thousand at a time with lower tier troops. Just keep playing, and the process will become faster and faster.","Food is just not something you will want to stockpile in this game. Use it or lose it. 

There's no ""starvation"" mechanic in this game. Troops don't actually need the given amount of food for upkeep, they can last indefinitely without it, and only consume it if it is above protected levels. So keep it below. 

Now, you have a problem. You're sitting on 8 million, and you don't want that to go to waste. Well then your only choice is to spend it. Train troops, research things, and check out the expeditions tab to stockpile food, essentially converting unboxed food into boxed food. 

*Do not* dismiss troops. Troops are way more important than food on hand. Don't stop training them. Your upkeep number really shouldn't matter at all, let alone factor into how many troops you keep around. Just keep training constantly unless you're saving for a major upgrade. 

Food is just something you're going to have to collect boxes for, and only add it to your resources when the time is right. If you need 10 million food to upgrade your keep, you're going to need about 9.5 million in boxed food/ prayer candles, etc. 

I get that it's somewhat counterintuitive, but food is just not something you want to have a lot of on hand. 

Furthermore, you only want to collect large quantities of other resources *if* you can protect it. If you can afford a daily 24 hour shield, yes, stockpile. Or if you're confident you can spot an attack before it comes, go ahead and stockpile. Otherwise, I suggest not using it as it comes, because having millions of each RSS will invite attacks. 

If you keep your rss below protected levels, and send your troops away to farm, you have a de facto peace shield. No one will be able to hurt your power level by killing troops, and they won't be able to take your rss, because it'll be protected. Worst they can do is break your walls and then boom, you get a free 24 hour peace shield anyway! 

TL;DR: Don't stockpile rss on hand. Save crates and open them only when you're upgrading. Use your rss as you get it, on troops and upgrades and research. Keep it below protected levels and it won't get eaten, and nor will anyone be able to take it.",Upgrade your sawmills and keep your opened food (the stuff in the top bar) below the protected amount. Troops don't consume the protected food.,You don't lose wood unless you get attacked,"You can have as much wood, stone and iron out as you like - it’ll only go down if you’re attacked. But keep your food in crates until you need it, your troops will use it - fast.","Ok heres whats up:
 1) You've got a building called the storehouse.  It increases your ability to safely store resources.
2)  Your troops eat your food... WHEN...  Your food is above your store house capacity.  Therefore....
3)  You need to spend your food before you go over store house capacity or your troops will eat it during upkeep.  You pay NO UPKEEP if you are below store house capacity.
4)  Dont open your crates!!!! Unless you are spending right then and there.  Your resources get stolen when your keep gets attacked.  Most kingdoms also follow a ""1million rule"" where you won't get attack unless your resources are over 1million.  There's no upkeep on wood stone and iron, but no point opening your crates.",Thanks for the tips. :),What if my opened food is well above my protected amount?,Yes: you cannot save food in your primary inventory.... Just the way it is.,Which I had known about not opening crates early on. Doh!,Then your troops will continue consuming it. I'd suggest using it to upgrade some sawmills and do some of the economy tree research or city defense.,"No matter what you wont be thrown into a kingdom where you are weeks behind, unless you use a friend code to put yourself in a kingdom that is weeks ahead of you.

KCCO","Honestly the best way to accumulate points is training troops, my recommendation would be train only T1 troops until you unlock T6, then select a specialty to gear for, infantry, ranged, or cavalry. at that point train T6 of your selected and T1 of your other 2. Siege I would always train your highest Tier available as well as traps.
you should constantly have your 5 troop producers creating troops, or at least as constantly as you can.
please note that while troops can make up a huge amount of power rather quickly, if they are killed that power goes away and has to be replenished in order to get it back. it should also be noted that the fastest way to train troops, ie instant, would be to spend real life money. that being said it is 100% possible to get yourself to a power level that make you difficult/impossible to attack without spending a dime. possible but takes a very long time.

KCCO",Money. Spend lots of money.,"This all seems quite bizarre, as intuitively I want to train the highest level of everything all the time. Can you explain the reasoning behind training t1s? Is there a huge power jump that makes everything useless once you reach t6?","basically we call T1s a meat shield, in reality a meat shield is any troops that are left in your base to protect you while the rest of your troops are on marches. the reason I recommend T1s for the meat shield is because they are the most cost and time effective. I have seen a meat shield of T1 troops easily stop T8 and T9 full marches if the numbers are high enough.
in short yes there is a significant jump that makes everything else basically useless for marches. T6 is the first point I have found that really starts to matter, full marches of T6 for example can solo 2 star seats of power, instead of needing to rally with your alliance, which is much more time efficient. in K274 for example any time there is a SoP opening it is decided who will hold it less than 30 seconds after it unlocks because everyone is soloing, this includes paramounts","The chests are always random. It's that simple. It's a random reward. Sometimes you'll get something good, sometimes you'll get something you'll never use. The only way to increase the odds of getting what you want is to get a bunch of those such chests, or to find your given advanced material another way, such as through event rewards, or by defeating the neutral spawn associated with them. Unfortunately those latter options aren't exactly that much better than random, and you'll have to wait for your given advanced material to show up in the rotation.","unfortunately it is always random in my experience, or at least based on the event you received/bought, the chest during. either way unless you open them during that event impossible to tell if you have multiple chests.

If you're not in an allegiance you're missing 3/4 of the game.
Also, diplomacy..
In my kingdom the leaders of the strongest allegiances have set rules to protect ""smaller keeps"" such as not attacking without a scout first, and no attacks if the keep doesn't have 1mil of at least one resource. This certainly helps someone who isn't investing money into the game.

Most allegiances use discord to keep in touch and will help you along quickly

I'm currently level 31 with a level 15 keep (upgrading this week to 16).","Build and upgrade farms and sawmills until it starts to cost bricks.

The bots are definitely illegal/unethical but make things so easy in game, per a friend who uses it. ;) ",Could you find me more info on project Q by any chance? curious how it works. Thanks mate!,"So all of these bots (Agent Q, Theia, 3ER and whatever else is out there) work by the same principle:
They automatically receive data or send commands from and to the game servers.
The way this works is that you basically reverse-engineer the communication between the game and the game servers. This communication only temporarily works for a few hours / days from what I could grasp from the Cleopatra investigation. You either have to restart again or get permanent access. I don't know how this part works.

The other things are quite easy: the game servers give you all the game data that you want.
You just run a script every few minutes which scans the entire map and records every data set it finds. Then, you save it in a database and now can search it for a specific type of creature, farm or enemy.
Some bots (Agent Q, from what I've heard) for example look for shields that drop. Remember you have that database? You just look for the info in the game code that tells you if a player is shielded. If this info changes from shielded to unshielded, this info then gets sent to the owner of the bot. 

All these infos are freely in the game. No ""hacking"" required.
From there, all the data that you want gets processed the way you want it (e. g. shield watcher, enemy coordinates checker) and then sent to the owner and users via discord. ",Does anyone have access to Agent Q they are willing to share? asking for a friend ;),Does it work again already?

As for what to do right now, I would send out a warning to your group that  retaliatory attacks are imminent- tell everyone to shield up or be vigilant until something else happens to distract the enemy clan. It sounds like you’re in a new-ish kingdom which is good, it should still be pretty chaotic. Also, don’t hive (gather all of your people in one location).

 Looking back, the greed is obvious. The game is designed to let you play free just long enough to really hook you and make you feel like you've put a ton of work into it, but keep you feeling like you're not powerful enough. It's nothing but a major cash grab by WB Games.","Few options:

","I believe Calvary and siege together are best for gathering. As for which to concentrate on training- it depends on your strategy and the regions/Seat of Power you want to hold, as they come with different bonuses.

Sounds like they were the best from this description, and the worst alliance is this ARSON group with poor strategy.","Doesn’t really take much skill to brutalize a bunch of unprepared noobs with an assurance they are safe. Of course the ARSON group deserved what they got, and they have collapsed and splinted now, but in terms of being the best they really didn’t do anything masterful.","Not sure what you mean. You mean they’re like morally the worst or something? Because what you described was that they took King’s Landing and their only real rival smashed themselves to bits and then split apart. Which sounds like a job well done. 

Re-reading your posts, I see you were in a group they broke a treaty with after KL, which is pretty much the end game anyway. I can understand you being upset, but I’ve seen (infinity symbol) treaties broken in this game. Was there any connection between your group and this ARSON bunch that failed?","Not morally, its just that they became the best through no real manoeuvres of their own. They had the biggest alliance and snowballed, and then proceeded to roflstomp all other clans after ARSON failed. So, not that they aren’t the best, but any group could be the best in that situation.

No, no affiliation between me and ARSON.

Having bannermen allows you to take hold of a Seat of Power (they all require different amount of bannerman to be under you based on 'Star Level').

Then they invariably demolish the targeted player, unless they manage to shield in time, and start again somewhere else. I assume this must be fun for them.

The number is your MARCH POWER, not player power level. March power can be determined by math (your highest troop tier power # x march size) OR you can start a rally against something random, put your march in it and see the march power written on the rally page. Dont forget to cancel the rally after you see this number. Your rallies collective march power is required to meet that quota stated above to successfully attack a seat of power. Troop composition does NOT matter. You can have all archers and do wall damage so long as you pass that required number. 7 successful attacks with the ""take over"" function when choosing to attack can get you the NPC seat of power.

Presently I'm at Keep Level 17, with about 100,000 troops (Tiers 4-6, mostly 6). I broke my 'no-spending' rule after getting hit too many times to count just when I had enough resources to do a Keep upgrade. Spent $100 on a Shield Pack and another $100 on a Feast of the Crone pack over the holidays, which came with 140,000 gold.

The packs really accelerated progress. I won't lie. It was like taking speed. I went from Keep lvl 14 to lvl 17 in one day. The Shield Pack is basically a necessity, otherwise you cannot amass enough rss to upgrade.

I got rid of my Tier 1-3 troops when I felt I had enough Tier 4 and 5 troops.","Great advice on the Storehouse. I could add a few tips.

1.) When you start, build as many Farms and Lumber Camps as you can. Food and wood might be plentiful from Tyrion's quest rewards at first, but in order to obtain Big Fish status, you'll need a helluva lot more than Tyrion will give you.

2.) Sort of connected to 1, but don't sweat the upkeep cost in food incurred by your troops. At present, my upkeep costs are about twice what my hourly food income is, but I have never once run out of food. I know of players who have upkeep that runs 4 or 5 times what their farms produce, and don't run out unless they go offline for an extended amount of time.

3.) Save those Advanced Teleports. You might need them to escape belligerent neighbors, but hopefully you can save them for when you increase your Keep level. You'll want to scout out an area that has appropriately leveled creatures nearby, and move there ASAP. Attacking creatures is not thrilling, but it will keep you in a steady supply of resources and crafting materials which you will need.

4.) Build a large army quickly, and upgrade troop types as quickly as possible. The Big Fish will be sporting Level 5, 6, 7, even 8 troops by now. In order to keep them away, you'll need a sizeable army of mid-range troops (they'll serve more as a deterrent, along with keeping your resources below protected levels, until you're strong enough to fight them off on your own).

5.) Always, always, always attack Event creatures. They'll carry resources that are worth their weight in gold (literally, as it happens, since there is no other way to get them except by paying gold, i.e. IRL money.) Soldier Pine, Pale Metal Shards, Scholarly Fragments, and especially mother*cking BRICK, are all integral to advancing building and research past a Level 10 Keep.","I've been getting attacked, constantly, the last 10 days.

I, cannot, get any further.  Without spending money that is, and I'll never P2W and this is totally a P2W game.

This game WILL fail if this keeps up as my interest is waning.  Nothing like loggin in to find out, that I've been attacked again, but some fuck named ""B0nerchamp"" and have lost all my troops and supplies.

Did you know, that the cost to heal high end troops is fucking ridicious?  Like, why even bother.

Talk me off a ledge please, cause I was really having fun and then everyone started to attack me.

","Some good info. A few points I'll add:

-Troop upkeep only comes out when your storehouse is full of food. If you have less than that, your food level won't go down.

-Build as many traps as you can, this also deters people from attacking your keep.

-Pay attention to your march size, which is the number of troops you can use during attacks. Having twice as many troops as you can use while good defensively takes its toll in upkeep.

-Don't waste time keeping a peace shield always active. It can me more useful to activate if you are about to be attacked. Even if the enemy is already marching to your keep you can activate it before they get there. 


",Yep. Each building upgrade I need now takes 71 bricks. ,"The cost to heal wounded troops can only be described as BANANAS. The most I've ever had at one time is just around 12,000, and the cost to heal them all was well over 2 million food. What. The. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuck.

That sucks, man. Do you have any teleports left? If one player is attacking you as it sounds, the best thing to do is get away from them. I'd even use a random one in your situation.

Also, if (rational) players are picking on you, it's likely because they see by scouting that you have more resources than your Storehouse will protect, which makes you an easy target. Of course, you might be unfortunate and surrounded by dickhead players who are attacking for no good reason, in which case, teleport, if you can.","and nothing has bricks, nothing",I already stopped playing.

",I started on release day and quit after two or three weeks. The whales on my Kingdom had spent *hundreds* of dollars in the opening week and there was no way of competing.

I’m house Aherne at cleaners keep and his jeep is only lvl15 I’m on lvl15 house and almost lvl13 keep I’m wondering what lvl you need to be to even attempt taking a seat of power,"I just re read my post and apologies for the spellings!! Cleganes Keep is where I am staying for now, I’ve found 2 gold quarries for coins, high level wood and food pits too so I’m going to try and build as high as I can as quick as I can, feel free to look me up in the game, I am not very sure about the bannermen and liege part of the game yet and don’t have many, I’m sure like other games I play the alliance side of things will improve and chat will get better but for now I’m a bit of a loner lol","I'm in kingdom 13!

I’ll work with someone tomorrow to get you in if you want,I'm my own Liege Lady,A lot of times the seats will say how many bannerman you need to have to even take the seat and I’m sure it’s the same in other kingdoms as is K9 but only the seats of power in the section “The North” are open to be controlled yet. Hope that helps,"I'm riding out the storm that is the mess of a new kingdom on these apps, so while I haven't gone for a seat of power yet I can tell you you don't need to be a very high level but it depends on the level of the seat of power itself. Most times you do need at least two other bannermen and should be at least a level 10.",Hey we have 50+ members looking for more if you want. We have a discord chat. Private message me flynn25#8100,"Haha thanks for the invite! Truth is I got super angry with the game yesterday, found one last flaw that was the straw that broke the camel's back and I uninstalled it.",I don’t blame you lol. If you ever comeback just let me know,Are there seats if power that low lvl? I’m lvl12 keep and lvl15 house. The nearest seat of power to me is cleanses keep which is lvl 15 so I imagine it is going to take a long long time before I can attempt to take it,"I know what you mean, the alliance system at the moment sucks and they need to refine it a lot for the game to have a quality of life","I wish i knew, the game is so new there isnt a lot out there to go by.","Im also in kingdom 14, what allegiance are you with?","We are currently in [WZRD] with GlitchedSights as main Leige, a good 8 of us for now, i have 2 Position 3 Bannermen slots, and the same for 2 other Position 2 Bannermen.

Havent seen any of your squad in the kingdom chat though.","You can start your own alliance and join another at the same time. You and the bannermen under you are your own group. If the lead (say you in this case) decides to ""bend the knee"" to another leader, you and all your banners join them and become larger. ","Also looking for the answer, I understand you need bannermen and such but idk how to create one officially.",Working fine on my Galaxy S5.,Try updating your phone's software ?,The Vale is opening Friday other than that no ,Is this definite?,"If you get attacked your alliance can send troops to help defend you, and you can work together to take Seats of power which provide bonuses for the alliance that has them. 

As far as teleporting, it's good to be close to the people in your alliance so your troops don't take forever marching. Also, right now only the north is open to taking seats of power, and they're opening up the riverlands next. So if you want to take something there you need to be close. 

If you're in kingdom 11 you're welcome to join my alliance!",I think ive gotten more than one teleport. So you will probably too. You can also always buy one.,"Are you actually running into a material issue at this point in the game? Have you p2w your way up to really high level already or something?

This is the biggest boost people get to the 100k mark,But it goes down over time?,what do you mean by it goes down over time?,It seems like when I return after a while it decreases but maybe I’ve been leveling up so much that it only seems that way,Doesn't go down over time,You have to pay for it...,"I got mine like 2 days after 
","LOL Not the best start, is my second day on the game and with bugs, disaster frame rate, pop ups and now this...

Mine was there.,The shields are there coz the game was launched recently. Wait for a week or so and the shields will disappear,"Right now while everyone has their free shields up from launch the best thing you could do is probably upgrade your keep and army but once everyone's free shields wear off the PvP part of the game will actually become more fun hopefully 
Killing creatures is a good way to bring in additional food and wood and once you start killing higher level creatures they drop loot necessary to upgrade certain buildings or research certain things or to craft higher level equipment","Game literally was just released to global,  it'll pick up when the game is  fleshed out.",hard to ramp up a games reddit out of thin air,Who knows. That's a good question though,"Sending upkeep means that they would supposedly send troops to ur kingdom 

U can do that by tapping on ur bannerman on the map and then tapping the reinforce button suck will take you to a screen where u can send troops","Check out stats.

I'm level 12, all my buildings are either level 7/8, I have up to the third tier units, power level over 200k, and every time I face off against anything level 7 I'm defeated. ","You need about 5000 units to beat level 7, at least thats what it took for me

Oddly level 8 isnt much harder than 7.","I sent around 1500 lvl 2 troops each and 1000 lvl 1 troops each against lvl 7 and I won without any casualty.

I don\'t know how this part works.\n\nThe other things are quite easy: the game servers give you all the game data that you want.\nYou just run a script every few minutes which scans the entire map and records every data set it finds. Then, you save it in a database and now can search it for a specific type of creature, farm or enemy.\nSome bots (Agent Q, from what I\'ve heard) for example look for shields that drop. Remember you have that database? You just look for the info in the game code that tells you if a player is shielded. If this info changes from shielded to unshielded, this info then gets sent to the owner of the bot. \n\nAll these infos are freely in the game.
