0,e4w4vv,How would I buy a voucher for this game for my son-in-law for Christmas?,"Hi all,

My son-in-law loves this game on his phone. I would like to buy a voucher for the game so he could treat himself. I have absolutely no idea how I would go about this? He used to have an iPhone so (I presume) I \*could\* have bought him an iTunes voucher. However, he's changed his phone now to an Android phone. 

My questions are...

1) How do I buy a voucher for the game that will work on an Android phone?

2) How much does everything cost in the game? i.e. what would be an acceptable amount for a voucher? I don't want to give him a voucher that he can't buy anything with? (I'm in the UK ). 

Thanks for any help you can give me. :-)",8,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/e4w4vv/how_would_i_buy_a_voucher_for_this_game_for_my/,2019-12-02 11:26:00

I don't play the game often anymore, so if you get this account you will have over 280% in training speed to increase power level even further, and most of my farms, sawmills, quarries, etc are near level 20, so you should have no problem in training as much as you want and upgrading the keep soon, and additionally I have tobho gear which gives you 4 hours and 20 minutes of free building time. House level is 31, about to reach 32. I liked the game at first but it's taking up too much of my time, so I would like to sell it to make up for the amount of money I spent on it. The price is negotiable, but I'd rather see it go for 250 or OBO. Pm me for more info.",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/dzp5mz/k22_in_kingdom_461/,2019-11-21 23:14:35

17,dnmsbg,Does Anyone Want To Join Me In A New Kingdom?,"I played earlier on in late April for two weeks and did pretty well, in comparison to other power levels. I believe I only spent like $10? I accepted a new job in Yellowstone National Park, where Cricket doesn't have service. My contract is up on the 5th where I'll leave the park and regain service, but I'm coming back for the winter so I'm switching to Verizon.

I was curious if there's anyone that wishes to join me in my new kingdom. It'll be probably be sometime between the 6th and 7th of November when I'll start. I plan on spending $200-$600 a month once I get a handle of the game, though that's not a guarantee. I want an aggressive alliance, but not one that holds *all* the SOPs. I want it to be fun, not kill the kingdom. I don't necessarily need big spenders, but I do need people to be active. Not a job per se, but active logging in at least once a day, as the alliance can only thrive if you're active in it. It's perferable to have people who are experienced, but having people that are new will help just as much.

Another question I have is focused on packs. In Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire, packs started out at $4.99 then went up to $19.99 and then $99 and stayed there. After a while if you hadn't purchased anything, it might to as low as $50. Im curious as to how packs work in this game. Do they stay at $.99 and after a few purchases go up to the next price tier? What packs should I absolutely avoid, and which should I buy? I'd look up videos, but the wifi where I lived and work is complete and utter shit. Also, I'll read somewhere online where someone will say, ""Buy these two packs!"" and person B is saying to buy other packs.

64,c7sc7e,Attack Marches: Mix of all or a single troop?,"So I have specialized my gear and research all towards archers. Just to give an idea, at the moment I have 70% attack on archers, 40% attack on infantry and 20% attack on cav (only using attack stats now for illustration purposes).

My question is if this is the right strategy. Should I instead be going 100% archer march? Also, what should be my strategy when I come across cavalry. Should I still do 100% archer march or switch to 100% infantry? or 50 - 50?",6,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/c7sc7e/attack_marches_mix_of_all_or_a_single_troop/,2019-07-01 17:05:57

96,btdtq0,Why This Game Sucks,"I’ve been playing GOTC for about a year and a half or so. Off and on. The off times were usually because I was fed up. I’m not a quitter though - shit, maybe I’m just a sucker for punishment. Either way. A year and a half is astounding in that most games don’t hold my attention for even close to that long. I made lots of friends in the game, and in the various discord servers - and that’s the only thing that kept me playing. 

I was a free-to-play player, avoiding spending money on the various packs for resources, gold, and building materials. This was especially challenging, since in order to avoid being attacked - your resources had to always be below the protected levels. How does one move forward in the game by upgrading buildings and troops - with upgrades that can cost upwards of 3 or 4 million each of food and wood - if you constantly have to be below 400k of each?  Simple answer? You don’t. Not without spending money. 

There are tens of thousands of players who spend hundreds, if not thousands, each. They buy the expansion packs and extra resources and gold. This gives them quite the leg up. They have a significant advantage over those who don’t spend, or can’t afford to spend. A guy like me, stuck at Keep Level 15, is constantly under attack from players who have spent a shit ton of money to get to Level 25. They send their troops for whatever resources they can pillage, wiping out all yours in the process. Now. On top of the millions you need to upgrade a building, it’s going to cost you millions on top of those millions to heal all the injured troops. 

You can purchase shields to protect you. Or use the 2 and 8 hour shields you get from certain achievements. Or, you can be online 24/7.  It’s the only way you’ll ever get anywhere if you don’t spend money. 

I have been levelled time and time again by players who are 10 levels above me. (For comparison - I have 1.5 Million in power. The guys levelling me have anywhere from 15-60 Million in power.)

Recently, a player attacked me. Injured every troop I had - and even killed about 20,000. I asked him why he had attacked me - I had no resources for him to take. His reply? “I just felt like it.”

I have sent messages to the developers and customer service, asking why there isn’t a limit as to how far below your level you can attack. A level 25 player shouldn’t be able to attack anyone lower than 20. You could attack anyone you wanted who was a higher level - if you’re brave enough. But there should be a 2-5 level limit when you are attacking a player at a lower level than you.  What did customer service or the developers say?

Nothing. Not even a reply. 

I did note a new event where you can attack strategic tiles for “battlefield resources”. You can only attack these tiles if your keep level falls within its range. How convenient. You can implement a level limit for something like that - yet you allow massively powerful players to prey on the much smaller ones without any restriction. 

They don’t care about the players who aren’t paying to play. They are making their money from those heavy-hitter types, and could care less about the new players or players who are struggling to stay in the game without spending money. 

If you want to play and enjoy a game for free - stay away from this game. The only way to get anywhere in this game is to spend money. And lots of it. 

WB Games. The developers. Their Customer Service - all of them don’t give a single fuck about you unless you are paying to play. 

I think. This time. I’m actually done with this game. 

TL;DR - You cannot get anywhere in this game without spending a ton of money. You will be levelled constantly by much higher level players who have spent a ton of money to get where they are - often for nothing more than the sport of it.  Their customer service is shit, and the developers don’t care about the players who aren’t paying to play their game.

161,bfyef5,Bran already spoiled the fight (SPOILERS),"He says to Jamie “how do you know we win will” (or something along those lines). Given brand gift it’s safe to assume he has seen the outcome of the Winterfell battle. 

I look at Bran as Dr.Strange in the avengers. He has seen the outcome of the battle and knows exactly how to play it. Just like when strange gave the stone up. Bran will bait the night king. This will look bad for the team as we will have a major death here (Euron Greyjoy) but ultimately they will win the battle. 

On a side note: the encounter between Dany and Jon as the end was disappointing. Yes she got hit with a big truth bomb after Jon being the rightful heir to the throne, but he never said he wants it. Maybe he’s fine being “The stark bastard” and will have Dany make him an official Stark after the battle. She seems to be jumping the gun here. Not very leader like if you asked me. 

Final side note: Sansa and Euron get together. Provided they live

167,be8j26,"[SPOILERS] Hi, poorly made theory here","I'm not sure about who will take the Iron Throne but I am certain about this: Jaime will be the one to kill the Night King. 

Think about it, it seems that the name ""King slayer"" is mentioned whenever a character is talking about/to Jaime. I believe that this is done intentionally as a way of hinting the reader as to his final feat. 

Such example of a way it could happen is as follows:

During the all out battle between the North and the white walkers, Brienne sees an opportunity to slay the Night King himself.  She charges at him but he is aware of this. He turns quickly and impales her on one of his ice spears. Jaime witnesses this and cries out in agony. The Night King lowers her to the ground and leaves her to die. Jaime springs toward Brienne but there is nothing he can do,  she will die. In her dying breath she says this: ""Jaime,  take my sword. You must be the one to kill the Night King. "" She dies. 

Jaime grabs Oathkeeper and scans the battlefield for the Night King. He spots him and carefully approaches from behind. Amazingly the Night King is preoccupied and does not realize his impending doom. With the force of 10 men, Jaime drives the blade through the Night King's back in poetic symmetry to the way that he slayed the Mad King. 

Ok that's the end of my theory.  Thank you for your time.

211,9vkn7t,Newbie Questions,"Greetings Lords and Ladies,

I have 3 major questions for you:

&#x200B;

**1 - Is it worth training thousands of Level 1 and 2 soldiers (all) on early game (Around Level 11) ?**

**2 - Is it worth investing in dragons early on when the production is still low ?**

3 **- Where are Level 5 and 10 crafting materials harvested from?**

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time, I appreciate all helpful replies.  


\[EDIT\]   


One more question:   


At level 11, I only have 1 Farm and 1 Saw, specially because I'm following quests and I was expecting Tyrion to give me ""Build 2 more farms"" kind of quests.   


Should I start expanding and freely building multiple farms and saws or should I upgrade the only ones I have right now ?

I know they are using python to do it but i'm guessing most of this is all using Open search architecture so they wouldn't get flagged by the developer by using licensed equivalents. 

Has anyone seen similar projects based in github or any other repository similar to the features of this app? I think it is criminal what they are doing and even more so with the fact that are charging that ridiculous of a rate for it..

236,8l47ru,Shame On Thrones: Warner Bros Allows Hackers to Cheat Players out of Thousands," Wildly popular WB app is plagued by cheating tactics that go unpunished despite multiple reports, allowing scammers to rob unsuspecting players of their investment in game and defraud Time Warner, WB Entertainment, Turbine, HBO, Apple and Google app stores.

Across the globe, Game of Thrones has become one of the most celebrated fantasy series in modern TV history. Over 16 million fans flock to their televisions in great anticipation as each new episode unfurls... And GoT is also one of HBO’s most profitable franchises. Products bearing the name \- everything from books to bobble\-heads \- are apt to fly off of shelves at break\-neck speed. So, it is no surprise that when Warner Brothers Entertainment released the strategic gaming app, Game of Thrones: Conquest ™, in October of 2017, millions of avid fans flocked to the game in hopes of living the ultimate fantasy of taking the Iron Throne for themselves.

Game of Thrones: Conquest challenges players to “build your house and raise your army as you navigate a dangerous political landscape”, but little did the players know, they would soon encounter a kingdom as rife with corruption as Westeros itself. In an extensive investigation, a collective of players have uncovered, documented, and reported evidence of unethical and, in some occurrences, illegal activity perpetrated by certain players who obtain unfair advantages by violating the rules \(T&Cs, Privacy Policies, California State laws\).

The tactics used to cheat vary greatly. From hand\-tailored cheating bots developed and owned by a small group of people who furthermore make money by selling these bots to other players, to refunds scams on the app stores and cyber\-bullying on third party chat apps. Countless reports of this cheating have been sent to WB developers, beginning as early as December 2017. Yet, as of May 2018, the offending players have gone unpunished leaving the honest, ethical players to be scammed by both the cheating players and by the game developers who continue to allow these methods to remain in play.

A complete catalogue of the evidence collected can be reviewed by clicking here : [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ooyAvHV4QEBS8RyRYbaWJuvMMHOb1qx2](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ooyAvHV4QEBS8RyRYbaWJuvMMHOb1qx2), and it is the sincere hope of those who participated in this investigation that actions will be taken to put a stop to the illicit activities that tarnish the Game of Thrones franchise and make the game unplayable for a majority of players.",11,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/GameOfThronesConquest/comments/8l47ru/shame_on_thrones_warner_bros_allows_hackers_to/,2018-05-22 00:57:17

258,7fde57,How to survive in this game.,"So today I have hit 1000206 power with 23 prestige and level 13 keep fully updated. I need4 million wood to move keep to level 14. It is getting longer between jumps but shows this plan works for the free to play player.So you have downloaded the game, worked out you need food and wood to progress but all the big fish in the pond smack you down and take your stuff like bullies in the playground. You want to develop but don’t know how and have turned to reddit for advice. That was a good move. Now first thing to build and monitor is the storehouse which is to the left of your keep. If you click on it and select info it will tell you how much food and wood is protected. Try not to go over that level no big fish will go to the trouble of bullying you if they can’t get your lunch money. Another thing to do is to click on the gears on the top right next to your power banner, from there scroll down to social and click on forums that’s where the developers and other players put their tips as well as here on reddit. The power banner lets you know how big someone is. Click on a keep, select house details, a big fish is over 750000 a really big fish (the ones with a seat of power) has at least a million. Until you are that big keep out of their way. Gather food from a farm, wood from a saw mill, attack creatures equal or lower than your keep level and use the resources to build an army and level up your troops. This takes either time or money, which you use is up to you. Good luck and enjoy the game. I don’t spend a cent and am level17 prestige with 17000 troops and a level 9 keep after 7 days.

Edit: On New Year’s Day 2018 I am level 13 Keep, with level 21 prestige, 721k power with 14k level 4 troops wounded. Building and researching from boxes resources gained from creatures and healing from gathered food. I get caught when real world issues allow troops to be caught at keep.

262,7bsc0q,Possible calamity heading for the game? Resource feedback.,"(Hello all, i posted this in the WB feedback forum and im posting it here as well to get other feedback and thoughts)

Hello WB and community,

   I was in my servers kingdom chat (K18), and after talking to some people, I had the realisation that a resource famine is heading for the game. This is my speculation based on my observations, please comment if you see a flaw in my logic.

   My theory is, due to the inadiquate means of farming resources in a PvE (Player versus environment), players are forced to attack other players and clear out the excess resources they have that is not protected. These victim players now have to go out and farm resources some other way, and host a massive army to prevent other losses. This massive army will consume FAR more food than an average players farms can produce. This player will probably never have excess food ever, because their army is consuming all the excess, and at higher levels, dramatically consuming their excess. (In my case I produce 16k food/hr and my army consumes 160k/hr. I will NEVER have excess food without consistantly farming over 160k food per hour from other players. And in order to upgrade buildings, I will need a lot of food, and a lot of lower level players will lose a lot of food. For example, to upgrade your keep from level 16 > 17, a player needs 14 million food and wood. Those numbers are HIGH, and a person has to activley attack other players throughout the day to meet that quota. The farms on the map that you can gather from are NOWHERE close to providing enough resources to complete these builds. And with the gamestyle (that i love) that has players attacking notable seats of power, the players need to raise large armies that consume well over any possible farm output by the players farms. The game is basicaly forcing a famine. 

   Now because of the high resouce cost of progressing through the game, the bigger players who probably have spent money on the game, are able to become the wolves, and all the F2P (free to play) people will become the sheep, without sheepdogs at their side. These players wont be able to upgrade their buildings and match the players who payed. I can confidently say, they will NEVER reach the level as the players who payed, because of the forced predatory playstyle that is nessasary to gather resources. Sooner than later, nobody wil have any excess food, because anything excess is being consumed by armys and taken by larger players. At this point there will be a standstil in production and progress for all players. Only those willing to pay can purchase all the resources they want. It is effectivly a pay wall. I feel that this isnt there by design, and WB has not forseen this becoming an issue. Players will quit due to frustrations of not getting anywhere in the game, and larger players will quit, ""Because it doenst matter whos skeleton sits on the iron throne"". You would be ruling over nothing. 

   Im suggesting that the devs change the means of production. Do something to the game that is engaging and is a decent and alternate way of farming resources. 

Might I suggest a few things? (Look at me im suggesting game changes)

-Massive lift on production on player farms?
-PvE gathering be quicker and more bountiful?
-Monsters drop more and larger resource crates? (that would probably defeat the purpose of a store house because players would stockpile crates in their inventory and only use them when needed)

Just spitballing here.

   Please feel free to share your thoughts on this. I think my argument is sound and solid. I would like to hear back from mods and other players. :D

272,79tu6a,"I love this game, but some things need to be fixed","1. The ads to buy in game resources and currency is ridiculous. I understand they have to make their money, but most players in the mobile gaming world know that games like this have micro transactions. This game is pushing it into our face more than any other game I have played. Just leave it as a menu option and don't shove it in our faces.

2. Performance Issues should not be a thing. I own a Nexus 6P which is a pretty good smartphone (I am planning on upgrading soon) and the lag is awful especially when searching the map to hunt/attack in really dense areas with a lot of people. You shouldn't have to own the latest smartphone to play this game smoothly. Even the chat lags. More people would play the game if it was optimized better.

3. The Interface is to cluttered. There is just so much in your face and its all just a mess. Make some menus to put stuff in and combine things such as the boost center and the in game purchases. Just get rid of showing your power on the main screen and just show it with your profile. Make the events and quests in a menu of its own. Decrease the clutter as much as possible. 

4. The Message center is straight up broke. I log on the game and every time it shows me messages I have already view/marked as read. Its deceiving seeing all of these messages when I get on. 

5. For the love of God please add a private messaging system. It is almost impossible to talk to a specific person in world chat. This would allow people to recruit easier. Make peace/war with people around you. Make Peace with other Allegiances.

1. How do you make an alliance? I mean like literally what buttons do you press. I've had some bannermen/lieges come and go randomly in the space of minutes so I don't really quite get how it works.

2. Is there a better source of income to get steel aside from killing creatures? You need a ton of it to craft gear for your profile and that seems to be the only way I can get it aside from upgrading the smithy.

3. Is it worth dismissing weaker troops when you get new ones? I'm starting to build tier 3 troops and I have some pretty nasty food problems. I think that's common with this type of game though, I've never played anything like this or Game of War before. Should I get rid of my tier 1 troops?

I will update with more info as I get responses/more experience with the game. Thanks for any feedback guys (:

318,77trsr,"I really want to like the game, but...","I like Game of Thrones and the game looks like it have many depth and possibilities.

...

**But the game make the access not easy:**

- UI and menu overkill
- Upgrades here and there, but I don't see any great effects from it
- Lags in my own town and especially on the big map *(and I have a new smartphone)*
- Soooo many things the game don't explain completely (for example the vassals, kingdoms, battle system)
- $$$ pop-ups

**Furthermore:**

- I recruted many troops 
- Upgraded soooo many buildings and did research
- Send troops into the world vs. enemies but the rewards are not a great impact compared to the efforts...
- Or most of the enemies have a shield and are not attackable

**And:**

- My power increased but it seems also useless...
