Two comments I have right off the bat:
1.  Is there going to be a vinyl release with the entire soundtrack? (This vinyl only contains 10 tracks).  I have seasons 1-7 on vinyl so this seems extremely incomplete. 
 2.  The quality of my vinyl is terrible. Both sides pop terribly.

25,e4v7mq,[NO SPOILERS] my fanfic in a script style on how it should end episode 1. (focusing on the starks only),"Jon Dany arriving in the north just like the actual opening of episode 1

that awkward introduction meeting between: \*bran and jon\*

\*dany and sansa\*

Bran: ""we don't have time for this.""

Jon and Bran exchange looks

Bran: ""jon, i have something very important to tell you""

jon give a worried look to Daenerys and bran noticed

Bran: ""just us the northerners.""

\*awkward silence\*

daenerys  looking at Jorah questionably, asking for advice by looks. Jorah smiled  faintly and nod at her. which leads to her giving the half-disapproving  nod at jon

jon  and bran nodding at each others, Jon continues by pushing Bran's  wheelchair , Sansa looking at daenerys, smirking at her ,bowing and says  ""pardon us, your grace"" then following her brothers, and the three of  them went inside winterfell castle, in the hall where all of them were  throwing a feast during roberts arrival which feels like a life time  ago.

\*in front of the fireplace\*

Arya was waiting for them, he run and hugged Jon. happily.

jon, shocked with the realization that arya is still alive,well and here, in their ancestral home

:  ""why weren't you outside? greeting me and the dragon queen? i thought  out all of the people of winterfell you'd be the only one who excited to  see the dragons""

Arya  giving needle to jon: ""i saw the dragons on the gate, then i realize  have something more important to do, i need to sharpen needle, my own  ""dark sister""(dark sister is the name of sword visenya targaryen ,which  arya idolize had) i want you to see , i took good care of it. i am  myself also so much sharper compared to the last time we meet""(lol the  cringe)

sansa smiles :""i can confirm that ""sharper"" bit.""

the three exchanges looks then laughs.

bran looking at them impatiently.

bran to Jon : ""Jon, you were dead""

sansa and area looking at each others ,confused.

jon: ""how did u know?""

bran ignoring the question :""and you were brought back""

jon: ""by the red lady""

arya looking intensely at Jon, rather furious

arya: ""what happened? who killed you!???""

Jon:  ""deserters of the nights watch...., but the most important thing, I'm  here now, i don't know how, i don't know why, but thanks to lady  melisandre, i am alive and well to see you three still alive""

arya: ""you can't trust her!""

bran: ""i dont, and it wasn't her who brought Jon back""

silence and exchange looks between the four

Bran: ""it was me,it was Brandon Stark,it was the raven, it was the night king"".

jon sansa and arya together: "" but how?!!!""

zooming to bran's face

zoom out and it was a scene several years ago when Jon was about to be resurrected ""supposedly"" by melisandre

Jon was lifeless on the death bed where Davos was pursuing melisandre about wether she can bring back jon to life.,

meanwhile  in the background, there's the three eyed crow in the window with 2  black eyes, and 1 white eyes in the middle, it glance at Jons corpse for  a second and flew out of the castle black, beyond the wall,

it  reached to the branch of a tree, below ,night king and all his armies  was massacring the wildlings. the crow observing the scene for few  moments, then intentionally flew towards the face of one of the  walkers,attacking his face, then it got killed by the walker's spears.

it fell to the ground and all 3 of its eyes turned into regular black eyes of a crow

but only for for few seconds.

then it begins,

the  night king was raising both of his arms, resurrecting all the dead  wildlings who one by one opened their blue eyes (hard home episode for  references)

and , so does the crow (this is where bear walkers, mammoth walkers , horse walkers make sense)

the  crow standing up from the blood stained snow , shrugs his wings, shakes  the snow off, and one of it eyes turned back to white, while the other  one turned blue just like the walkers. it now has blue, white , and  black eyes.

it flew back as soon as it can, back to castle black, flying sharply down throwing itself into the chimney and dissapears

at the same moment,its that scene where ghost was waking up from his nap,whimpers, he sense something fell through the chimney

jon open his eyes, gasping for air.

\*back to present time\*

jon was in shock, looking at his siblings

jon to bran :""but why?""

(oh jonny boy there is still another surprise in the store for you)

bran:  ""i saw it,i was there, i saw you getting stabbed by that boy my age, i  saw you on that bed with ghost lying below your death bed. but you are  the true heir of the seven kingdoms

\*everyone was so confused\*

bran  continues: "", and you are the only way to kill the night king, you need  to be alive to defeat him, I've been observing him raising the deads,  I've seen him with the wights made of giant elephants, I've seen it  because somehow i can get myself into his head. i figured maybe i can  warg into the crows as usual, to see whether i can transfer the Night  King's ability to raise the deads to your body, its a risk, really, i  don't know wether you will be brought back alive with blue eyes and  start to kill the rest or the night watch, and let the wall unprotected.  i don't even know  whether i can still be Brandon stark after that.

but here you are. ""

sansa: ""but if the Night king is dead, the rest of he walkers will be gone too, so does the wights and any part of his armies""

arya  who now realizes what sansa just said, moved her stares from her  sister, to Jon, and then Bran, frantically. ""are you saying he needed to  sacrifice himself for all of us and even cersei?""

Jon looking at bran looking for answers,

but he knew the answer.

26,e4ryxr,[Spoilers]What D&D Should Have Done,"For the first 4-5 seasons, the show didn't use that many screenwriters.  This made sense as they were pretty much just adapting the source material.  If you look at the writing credits for each episode, it's almost always either D&D, Bryan Cogman, and one or two others, with GRRM sometimes stepping in to do one episode a season.

Once they ran out of book material to adapt, what they should have done is extremely obvious in hindsight: hire a staff of seasoned writers and set up a real writer's room, the kind almost every scripted series would normally have.  I'm not saying they should have completely changed the writers, as that would have felt jarring.  Benioff, Weiss, and Cogman would still have been the main writers and overseen everything, but they also would have had a large writing staff to work with.  In Season 6, the show went from being an adaptation to a completely original story, and given the large number of characters and subplots who needed to come up with conclusions that even GRRM himself hasn't finished, a large staff was the best way to handle this.

Instead, D&D just took the entire workload on by themselves.  The two of them had to be the showrunners on the largest and most expensive TV production in history while also trying to write the ending themselves to a story that had no ending, that was conceived by someone else on such a large and vast scale, and in a short amount of time.

We'll never know how things would have turned out otherwise, but having a larger staff of writers certainly wouldn't have hurt.",15,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/e4ryxr/spoilerswhat_dd_should_have_done/,2019-12-02 05:13:04

Hi!
    I am not sure if this is the best place to post for what I am going to ask, but if it isn’t I hope you can give me the best contact info. My boyfriend loves Ms. Clarke as an actress, and admires her strength deeply. This year he (David) has survived two brain aneurisms. He has carried through with nothing but strength and hope since February 2019. December 5, 2019 he will finally receive a multiple time postponed surgery to remove the tumor causing the two aneurisms, as well as near daily seizures. Surgery week has arrived, and he is terrified. So scared he won’t wake up, or that something with be wrong with his brain afterwards. It’s a long shot to ask, but he’s worth it. Talking about Ms. Clarke gave him some hope again. If she does an even ten second video saying good luck David, I would be eternally grateful. Thank you for taking the time to read this and hope you guys can point me to some publicist contact info or something!",9,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/e47ul1/no_spoilers_emilia_clarke_ten_second_video_to/,2019-12-01 04:52:36

54,e2vog7,[SPOILERS] How GRRM will finish the story?,"Possibly, you are really disappointed with how D&D have finished the show. I really don't know have D&D consulted with GRRM about the ending. If you have some information about that, please, let me know. I can say only two things:

1. D&D have closely worked with GRRM in the last season. It means that GRRM consulted them about the ending, which he knew for several years and already made it up. This means, the ending of the show is also the ending of GRRM.
2. GRRM didn't work with D&D in the last season. The ending of the show is the work of D&D. They possibly do not know the ending of GRRM. Maybe GRRM refused to talk about it, because HBO didn't give money. This means, the ending of GRRM may be different. He already mentioned that the ending is the same and not the same at the same time.

I'm really excited about what GRRM will write. The first book of Game of Thrones published in 90's. He lives with these characters for 30 years already. Possibly, he thinks about them everyday. Possibly, he already knows his ending. And I hope that it will be a masterpiece.",12,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/e2vog7/spoilers_how_grrm_will_finish_the_story/,2019-11-28 12:20:07

58,e2kego,[SPOILERS] What is Jon’s legacy in Westeros after the events of the finale?,"Season 8 spoilers-

I was thinking about Jon being a queen slayer now and his new reputation. Is he now hated across Westeros the same way that Jamie was? He is a legend among the Wildlings, and I figured he’d be a legendary figure in Westeros with his revival (which was totally glossed over in the show, no one ever brings it up), winning back Winterfell, being named King in the North, and him being the primary person preventing The Long Night (unifying the lands). He’s one of the greatest heroes in Westeros history, bums me out to think he’s hated for killing a tyrant queen. Not like it matters to him much since I doubt he’ll ever be returning from north of the Wall anyway.",27,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/e2kego/spoilers_what_is_jons_legacy_in_westeros_after/,2019-11-27 21:34:04

65,e1yzmj,[NO SPOILERS] Got my GoT Complete Collection Collector's Edition Blu-ray Box Set,"Received my set a little early, as the release date is December 2. Mine is the Nordic (Finland/Sweden/Norway/Denmark) version, but it should be similar to the US and UK versions. Overall, it's a really cool set imo. The outer box is made of wood, while the individual cases are vinyl-like cases and made of thick cardboard. The wooden box was packaged in a styrofoam-padded cardboard box, which was nice as it prevented damage during transit.

The diorama image formed by the cases looks really nice in person. The box set has 3 additional bonus discs and the season cases have 4 discs per season (seasons 1-6) and seasons 7-8 have 3 discs each. The bonus sleeve also includes a small booklet, which was disappointing, as it basically only lists the contents of the discs + episodes. No character bios, episode synopses, family trees or maps. At least it has nice artwork, but the booklet could and should have been a lot better. Luckily all the retailer exclusive bonus features are included on the bonus discs. Conquest & Rebellion is also included.

The set is also a lot bigger than I expected. I honestly thought it would be only slightly bigger than regular Blu-ray box sets, but it's huge. I put one steelbook in a couple of pictures as comparison. The box set doesn't really include that many goodies, only the Hand of the King pin (that is used to lock the leather strap on the side of the box), the small booklet and a thank you letter.

Here are some pics of the set. Overall, a really nice and beautiful set, but I would have preferred to have some sort of book (or a bigger booklet) that would have included some character bios, maps etc. The artwork on the sleeves is beautiful and two-sided. However, the sleeves are really impractical to slide in or out of the box, as they're so closely packed in, so they tend to stuck onto each other and it's a bit of a hassle to get them out (or put them back in). The box set also has two protective and translucent plastic films next to season 1 sleeve and the bonus sleeve. They can easily be slided out of the box, but I prefer to have them, as it creates a window-like look to the diorama and prevents dust from getting into the diorama.

The sleeves are two-sided and have artwork and discs on both sides on disc pouches. Seasons 1-6 have 2 discs each side, seasons 7-8 and the bonus sleeves have two discs on the front side and one disc on the back side.

Sorry that the post got so long due to so many pictures. Anyway, I thought many would be interested to know what the set actually looks like.

66,e1xzdx,[SPOILERS] Seasons Ranked!,"8. Season 5: I love every season but this is the least rewatch able stuff like Sansa’s rape, shireen burned, and the sand snakes were dumb, but Dany meeting Tyrion was great and hardhome was phenomenal, so this is my least favorite but still good.
7. Season 7: This and 8 are basically tied, I love it very much it just feels rushed, like I love beyond the wall but I understand some of the writing lacks logic, but little finger dying was great, olenna’s death was badass, and Arya killing the Frey’s made for an excellent season.
6. Season 8: This is my opinion and personally I loved this season a lot. I found the writing to be great, and for the most part I thought it stayed true to the characters, Dany going mad made sense to me because she was acting emotionally, Jaime going back to cersei worked for me because while he understood she was evil he still loved her and wanted to die with her. I actually loved the battle of winterfell while it was hard to see I thought the deaths and action were great, sure I would like to see more battles because winter is coming since season 1 and it ends in one night it does feel anticlimactic. I enjoyed every episode except the finale, Bran getting the throne was dumb. And this season had some plot holes and was rushed in some areas but I overall really loved it.
5: Season 6: huge jump in quality here, battle of the basterds and winds of winter are my 2 favorite episodes in the show. Just show many great moments like hold the door, Cersei blowing up the sept, king in the north, R+L=J confirmed, and Ramsey getting eaten by his own hounds. I think that this season does drag with aryas story in bravos and Jaime dealing with the blackfish. But overall fantastic television.
4. Season 2: Great character work Tyrion really shines, black water is fantastic, Jon meeting Ygritte, a little slow at some points but just fantastic writing overall.
3. Season 3: Fantastic red wedding still gives me chills, no negatives with this season.
2. Season 1: It started it all. Ned Stark dying was such a great twist, just a perfect first season.
1. Season 4: Just perfect television, Tyrion and aryas arcs this season are the best in the show. Tyrion’s trial, mountain vs viper, and Tywin dying were all great, this personally my favorite season.

68,e1smd2,[Spoilers] A character that might make a return in the prequel of ‘House of the Dragon’,"I was looking at a few characters in GOT tonight & figure out which character might actually be able to make an appearance in the upcoming prequel, since the prequel is obviously set before the events of the original show. ‘House of Dragons’ will be set roughly 300 years in the past. Of course, no other character will be alive for these events.. but, come to think of it.. there is one character that might be able to & my theory is it could be Melisandre aka The Red Witch.
She dies after the ‘Battle Of Winterfell’ due to her old age which by Season 8 she is at least 400 years old according to the GOT [wiki page](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Melisandre) born in 100BC. 
The events of the prequel is 300 years ago so by the time of the prequel events she would still be at least 100 years old due to her worshipping the lord of light & her enchanting necklace keeping her alive for the purpose of  ‘Battle of Winterfell’ I’m just wondering if I could be right or could be just whimsical thinking, since she’s my favorite.. so, what do you guys think about this speculation?",12,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/e1smd2/spoilers_a_character_that_might_make_a_return_in/,2019-11-26 07:19:25

78,e1hasf,[SPOILERS] D&D's Biggest Mistake in Adapting the Books,"D&D's mistake when adapting the books was not including Dany's constant flashbacks to her 'home' in Braavos, the home with the red door where they lived after they first escaped to Essos.

&#x200B;

She always wanted to go back to the red door, because it was home, and she lived a comfy and safe life there and was loved by everyone, even Viserys was nice to her.

&#x200B;

Once she realizes she can never go back there, she decides that King's Landing, where her family ruled, would be her only true home, her whole mindset in the books is ""I can't look back at what I've done, i must find a way to go home.""

&#x200B;

I believe that when she's on Drogon and looking at the Red Keep and King's Landing, she realizes it's NOT her home and will never be, the people there fear and despise her, and she can never have a happy life, she's no more fit for the throne than Robert was.

&#x200B;

This realization that all her conquests and invasions were for nothing is probably what sets her off, but D&D should have included her thoughts about home from the books, then it wouldn't seem so contrived in the show.",9,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/e1hasf/spoilers_dds_biggest_mistake_in_adapting_the_books/,2019-11-25 18:09:51

80,e1gskr,[Spoilers] Jon and Dany,"Do y’all think Jon was distant to Dany because of the aunt-nephew thing or because the of the monster she was becoming?

I feel likes it’s the latter because there’s a good amount of evidence for Jon still loving Daenerys after finding out about his parentage.

Even after finding out who his parents is he kisses her and tells her “we can live together” in Episode 4. Jon also told Dany he has to tell his sisters the truth because they’re family. Dany misunderstood this for a lack of love from Jon and contributed to her madness and stupid actions. The real reason for Jon turning Dany down is because Dany becoming a monster. The first time he truly rejects her is in episode 5 after she has done some wack shit. Up until then he truly loved her. 

On top of that, their union would be the best solution for the kingdom and as a good man Jon would certainly take that. 

Ned’s parents were cousins and it’s medieval times so their ideals were very different. 

There are theories that in the books Jon will marry Sansa. Many are horrified but at the end of the day they’re only cousins. What makes the difference is that they were raised as brother and sister. In the case of Dany and Jon they’re almost like strangers. The writers of the show just needed just another stupid reason to make Dany go mad in like 2 episodes. Jon has done crazier things for love.

Jon was even leaning towards accepting the incest and being with Dany but then she went ballistic past the point of no return.
We all known Jon loved her till the end and only killed her because she was too far gone down the path of madness.",8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/e1gskr/spoilers_jon_and_dany/,2019-11-25 17:30:53

86,e1a2jd,"[Spoilers]I Just Finished Season 5; Should I Keep Watching, Or Is the Rest Just Fanfiction?","I've enjoyed the show thus far, but I've heard from almost the entire Internet that the show ends badly, that the cracks started to show once they ran out of book material, and that the end of Season 5 is usually pointed to as where they more or less caught up to the books.  Are the last three seasons worth watching, or do they just feel like fanfiction?

While I've definitely enjoyed the ride thus far, I have started to feel throughout Season 5 that most of the original storylines I liked about the show were starting to run thin.  The Season 5 finale, ""Mother's Mercy,"" felt like a nice culmination, including Stannis's and Myrcella's deaths, Cersei's public comeuppance, and Theon's arc.  If ""Mother's Mercy"" had ended up being the series finale, I think many audience members would have been satisfied.  None of these may be a ""final ending,"" but since I know the final ending is going to suck, I'm very satisfied with where I am now.

I also know, just from cultural osmosis, that both Jon Snow and the Hound will be coming back, but I actually really liked both of their respective ""deaths,"" and found them fitting.  If them being brought back is not canon in the published novels, then I don't really want to see their deaths undone.

But I'm open to having my mind changed.  Do you consider the show still worth watching beyond this point, and if not, what is the episode that jumps the shark?",20,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/e1a2jd/spoilersi_just_finished_season_5_should_i_keep/,2019-11-25 06:32:04

93,e14d8g,[Spoilers]Viserys Targaryen Is an Interesting & Tragic Character,"Yes, he is abusive to his sister and has an obnoxious attitude.

And then he grows up in exile, thought of as ""the beggar king."" Not to mention always living in fear of assassination.

Yes, he had a petulant and entitled attitude, but it's hard not to sympathize, especially when you lost everything due to events you had nothing to do with.

In his absence, the continent is to be dominated by the forces of the Old Gods, the ancient powers of ice and fire.

""Game of Thrones season 9:

After sending Jon Snow to the Nights' Watch, the new king of the now six kingdoms, Brandon Stark, will send in the Brotherhood without Banners to finish off the wildlings and save the world from extinction.

98,e0x0in,[no spoilers] Just because I watch GOT DOES NOT mean I like porn!,"Just because I watched GoT DOESNT mean I like porn!

So for context: I’m a Muslim female. I’m pretty religious. I wear abaaya and hijab and I’m very shy in public. I’ve never even hugged a guy in my life. However I’m very into movies,shows and video games and I am/was a huge fan of GOT (Game Of Thrones)

So I have a group of friends who are all Muslim yet I’m the only one who wears hijab and have the most knowledge about Islam. Now yes GOT isn’t exactly a Muslim friendly show but I loved the storylines and the characters and how you were always on the edge of your seat and there was never a dull moment. So my friends found out I watched it and most of them didn’t seem to care. If they did they didn’t voice it. But I have one friend who’s one of my closest friends and she went OFF on me.

She started questioning my religious beliefs and how I’m probably a really bad Muslim now because I watch GOT. Now she doesn’t know anything about the show. She sent me all these random articles (mostly from parenting/Christian sites) about how they promote abuse and are just porn shows

Tbh there isn’t THAT much porn. It’s just naked people most of the time. And also this friend (let’s call her Jane) has told me to watch shows which have had loads of sex scenes and nudity so I don’t see what her problem is.

Another time Jane told me about this interview she watched on YouTube and the title of the vid had the word Porn in it. As a joke I asked her why she was watching it and she literally said

‘You can’t question why I’d watch an interview which discusses porn while you watch GOT. You’re basically watching a porno’

GOT 👏🏽 IS 👏🏽 NOT 👏🏽 PORN 👏🏽 

It just annoys me when people - especially someone who is meant to be my friend - judge me as a person because I watch one show. It’s hard to express into words but now whenever I meet people I don’t tell them I watch it for fear that they’ll judge me because of my religion and stuff. 

I see this view everywhere. On twitter, on YouTube, in real life. Just let people watch what they want.

140,dyy31v,[Spoilers] What do you think about the possibility of *this* valonqar?,"Lady Stoneheart.

Here are my thoughts on why we should be looking at her as more of a possible candidate:

* The series kicks off with the Starks vs the Lannisters. Sure, Cersei makes a lot more enemies as the series wears on, but Catelyn has more reason to hate her than others. She indirectly got Ned killed, she held Sansa captive and facilitated Tyrion marrying her, her family conspired in the Red Wedding, etc, etc.
* This from Maggy's prophecy: ""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you."" This from Catelyn to Brienne: ""I have no skill with swords, but that does not mean that I do not dream of riding to King's Landing and wrapping my hands around Cersei Lannister's white throat and squeezing until her face turns black.""
* George RR Martin has repeatedly said that he enjoys when prophecies are true, but not in the literal sense. Cersei expects that Tyrion will be the valonqar because he's an *actual* little brother she shares animosity with. But Jaime is another *actual* little brother. If the two have beef, it would be illogical for Cersei *not* to expect Jaime to become the valonqar. And with Jon slaying Daenerys, the chances of Jaime pulling a similar ""go in for a kiss but stab you instead"" move seem minute, since it would be fairly anticlimactic or--if it occurred earlier--make the big Jon/Dany twist underwhelming. Catelyn is leading the *Brother*hood without Banners, and is likely more dimunitive than its other members, especially since she's undead now, thus ""little brother.""
* The valonqar bit was eliminated from the show. Back then, we thought maybe it was because it was too obvious that it was Jaime. But watching Cersei's fate in the show play out, and how disappointing it was, I felt fairly certain that GRRM would offer each character a more fitting end. Why didn't Cersei get the ending she deserved? Well, can we recall another important storyline omitted from the show that GRRM repeatedly said he didn't think should be omitted? *Lady Stoneheart.*
* People are wondering what the point of Stoneheart's arc is. That, to me, suggests there's more to come from her. I doubt she'd have lasted this long, or been brought back to life in the first place (since we know there has to be some purpose for that) if she isn't involved with *something* major.

People have been generating theories about GoT and ASoIaF for ages so I'm sorry if this reiterates points someone else has made. But it's been a thought of mine for a long time now and I'm wondering why discussions of the valonqar often include tons of people but I never see Stoneheart brought into them.",12,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dyy31v/spoilers_what_do_you_think_about_the_possibility/,2019-11-20 09:29:44

179,dxvftp,[SPOILERS] I’m late for this debate but...,"I just started Game of Thrones and I wonder why there was so much outrage over Sansa and Cersei’s rape scenes but not Dany’s? 

People complain the former two’s scenes were graphic but arguably her scene is the most graphic. She’s shivering and crying and this giant man who is at least a decade older than her casually wipes away her tears, takes her clothes off,  pins her hands to her sides when she tries to cover herself, runs his hands all over her, then forces her to her hands and knees and none of it is cut away from. Unlike with Sansa and Cersai she’s pretty much naked.

And yet just because she decided to take control of her situation the only way she can given she has no escape or choice and she’s too weak to fight Khal Drogo her story is a “romance” not the story of a rape victim and somehow Khal Drogo is this awesome loving husband character that didn’t deserve to die. I also hate that Jaime was portrayed as this man manipulated by his evil sister when he pretty much raped her in front of his son’s corpse but that’s a topic for another post. 

It really does baffle me that somehow Sanaa’s rape was what made people declare the show went too far. Dany and Sansa went through practically the same arc. They were both young virgins sold to another somewhat barbaric kingdom by someone they trusted, the only difference is how they coped with it, and also Khal Drogo wasn’t as much of a sadist as Ramsey.",41,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dxvftp/spoilers_im_late_for_this_debate_but/,2019-11-18 03:38:06

186,dxhloy,[spoilers] A set of minor story edits to correct screenplay issues in seasons 5-8,"The camera pans down to a room in Meereen, with Queen Daenerys and Lord-Commander Barristan of the Queensguard. The Queen speaks. 

""Ser Barristan, before you take a relaxing stroll through our city that is currently going through civil unrest, I insist that you wear a set of armor, and to hide your identity, cover it with a cloak.""

""Your Grace."" Ser Barristan replies with a nod. 

**A Short While Later**

The Sons of the Harpy are fighting The Unsullied. Grey Worm is injured, and it looks as though the Harpies are about to succeed in assassinating him. A cloaked, hooded figure appears at the end of the hallway. The voice of an old man is heard..

""All of you must throw down your weapons and surrender. I will ask the Queen to show you mercy."" 

The Harpies laugh at him, several taunts are made in their native language, asking how a lone, old man can stop them. None drop their weapons. 

The old man removes his cloak, and drops it to the floor. His shining Queensguard armor blazes in the light. One of the Harpies, recognizing him, bolts out the other end of the hallway, closes a large door behind him, and quickly attempts to bar it before fleeing, abandoning his fellow Harpies. One of the Harpies jeers at him for fleeing from an old man. 

Ser Barristan draws his sword. 

[The correct Barristan Theme music begins to play in the background.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaEzKRngCyY)

The Harpy closest to him flinches and takes a few steps back. One of the Harpies shouts to attack. The group charges to Ser Barristan. 

Over the next 45 seconds, the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtered. After the first couple of Harpies go down, one closer to the door begins to bang on it, shouting ""HELP US!"" while attempting to open the door. But the Harpy outside is now well out of earshot, and would not have returned if he could. They are trapped with Ser Barristan. Soon, the Harpy cowering by the door is the only Harpy still alive. 

The Harpy gazes upon Ser Barristan, his sword is now completely coated red with blood. It appears as if glowing bright red for a few moments, gleaming from the light shining through the hall windows. The Harpy knows that if he fights the Lord-Commander of the Queensguard, then he will die. This... Dark Lord Barristan outmatched him, with his glowing red sword. 

He throws down his weapon, kneels to Lord Barristan, and pleads for mercy. 

Lord Barristan helps Grey Worm stand, whom leans on his spear. Grey Worm thanks him for saving him a Harpy. 

""He's not for you to kill. Prisoners can be interrogated, and he is now our prisoner."" 

Grey Worm regards him with surprise, but grudgingly agrees. After a pause, he states ""We needed more prisoners anyway."" 

Lord Barristan chuckles. ""Heh.. all too easy."" 

The camera cuts to the throne room of Daenerys, the bound Harpy sits on his knees in front of Grey Worm, whom is sitting on the lower steps as his wounds are tended to. Grey Worm and several other guards are scowling at the prisoner. The prisoner asks what they are going to do with him. A Dothraki guard steps forward and looks over the prisoner, inspecting him, before idly remarking that his skin would not make very good leather. Too poor quality. 

Queen Daenerys quickly enters the room, and rushes over to Grey Worm, asking about the injuries. Grey Worm insists that he is fine - and that he was saved from significant harm by Lord Barristan, whom slaughtered a dozen Harpies alone - but Daenerys insists that he get some proper rest. Missandei helps him walk out of the room and to his quarters.

Queen Daenerys turns to Lord Barristan, whom is idly grooming himself and attempting to wipe any remaining spots of blood off his clothes. She speaks. 

""Didn't they cause you any trouble?""

Lord Barristan turns and smiles to her, shaking his head. ""Like carving a cake, your grace."" 

**Some Time Later** 

The camera pans down to Daenerys and Tyrion. ""You're going to advise me."" Daenerys says. Tyrion smirks and lifts a glass to toast the decision, before quickly having his smirk turn into a frown as Daenerys snatches the cup. ""While you can still speak in complete sentences.""

Tyrion pauses for a moment, sighs, and asks if he can choose the execution option. 

""Your Queen forbids it."" Daenerys replies. 

Tyrion lowers his head for a moment, grumbling. ""Oh, very well.."" and grudgingly agrees to limit his alcohol consumption to no more than five times the legal carriage-driving limit, before rushing on to squeeze in saying ""and what would you like me to advise you on?"" in an attempt to rapidly change the subject from his Queen-Imposed alcohol regulations. 

""How to get what I want."" she answers. 

""And what is that?"" Tyrion asks. 

""The Iron Throne."" she answers, with a stern, authoritative glare. 

Tyrion leans back in his chair, looks up at the ceiling, sighs, and folds his hands in his lap. ""It's really not all that great.. perhaps you should try wanting something else."" 

""If I want jokes, I'll get myself a proper fool."" Daenerys responds, glaring. 

Tyrion begins to respond, while leaning forward, grabbing a cup, and begins pouring wine into it, ""Is the Iron Throne what you want, or is that what Viserys told you to want? I know it's difficult to not want something you've been told to want all your life, but it can be - "" 

Tyrion stops speaking as Daenerys again snatches the cup away from him. He takes a drink directly out of the jug, before placing the jug back down in his lap, out of her reach. Daenerys raises an eyebrow at him and continues glaring. 

""You don't seem to be very good at following your own advice."" she observes. 

Tyrion sighs, and grudgingly places the jug back on the table, before folding his arms on the table, and wearily resting his head on them. ""I havn't wanted wine all my life. Just most of it. However, I am keenly aware wine is not what I really want. It just makes the pain of not getting what I want easier to stomach."" 

Tyrion stares at Daenerys for a few pensive moments, before continuing, ""As your advisor, I'd like to keep you from being in my situation.. so it's important we establish, what do you want?"" 

Daenerys glares at Tyrion, impassively. She ponders for a few moments, before breaking eye contact and looking around the room. 

""You seem to quite enjoy freeing slaves.."" Tyrion observes. 

""Yes, I do."" Daenerys says, for the first time in the scene, a slight smirk appears on her face. 

""Do you think you can do that better ruling from here in Essos, or across the sea in Westeros? I saw many slaves and slavers on my way to Meereen, was even sold as a slave myself at one point, this continent is filled with slavery. Who's going to save them if not you? Who's going to maintain the peace if your armies sail away?"" 

Daenerys leans back in her chair and studies Tyrion for a moment. ""It's true, maintaining the peace has been hard. Obviously it would be harder without my armies or my dragons. But there is no Iron Throne in Essos."" 

""There can be."" Tyrion states, leaning closer in interest, ""A thousand blades, forged in dragon-fire. Howabout ten thousand broken chains? A new Iron Throne, not from the swords of the conquered, but the broken chains of the freed."" he pauses for a moment before continuing, ""You may as well put all that iron to use.""

Daenerys tilts her head to the side and stares at him for a few seconds, before smiling. ""I think I'm going to like you."" 

**A Short While Later**

The camera pans to the front of the city of Meereen, at twilight. Daenerys' [theme music plays.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfmoyTL64R0) Nightfall is setting in, as carts full of chains are being unloaded into a massive pile. Tyrion and Missandei are looking over shipping manifests and ledgers, discussing the amounts of iron being shipped in from other cities Daenerys had visited, and inspecting shipments of stone. Tyrion and Missandei stand and observe the first of a large, stonework outdoor smithy in front of the city, too massive to be kept inside. Drogon stretches his wings in the background and roars, breathing fire into the air. 

A laborer reports to Missandei that the first stonework is completed and the first pile of chains are nearly done being thrown into the cauldron. After the laborer leaves, Tyrion and Missandei walk over to Drogon; Daenerys and Lord Barristan are standing beside him. 

""The first batch is ready, my Queen."" Tyrion states. Daenerys nods, and motions for Drogon and the others to follow her. She stands in front of the small mountain of chains, all that could be fit into the large stone cauldron. She quickly cautions Tyrion, Missandei, and Barristan to step back, before looking up to Drogon.

""Dracarys."" 

A gigantic flame lights the night, as a collection of smiths place a blueprint on a large stone slab. Tyrion, Missandei, Grey Worm, Barristan, and Daenerys stand with the smiths and the camera pans down to the blueprint - it depicts a new Iron Throne. 

The scene ends.

The Hound and Arya stumble across this old man who is sitting there bleeding out. He could be the old man the wildings tried to make Jon kill who ended up getting stabbed and left for dead. I’m not sure, it’s been a few days before in between episodes and I don’t really want to go check but anyway, point being, old man dying. 

So they talk for a minute and The Hound ends up putting him out of his misery by stabbing him again. As he’s standing up and cleaning his blade he looks down at Arya and tells her “That’s where the heart is”. She gives the wound one more significant glance as they stand and leave.

192,dx9k4t,[NO SPOILERS] Finnsih lyrics for Rains of Castamere,"So yesterday I was walking my dogs and in usual fashion was humming along the way and while I was humming the Lannister theme (rains of castamere) I came up with some finnish lyrics for the song. I dunno if they exist already but if not, here they are if anyone is interested. Bear in mind that I made these up in like 20 minutes so they are a bit rough around the edges and it is pretty much a direct translation rather than an interpretation of the song :) And if anyone here speaks finnish and would like to suggest changes, go ahead! 

""Ja ken, sä oot? Suur herra kysyi. 
Kun näin alas kumarran. 
Kissa vain oon, eri kuosissa. Sen todeksi tiedän.
Kuosi kultainen taikka punainen, 
leijonal yhä kynnet on.
Ja omani, on pitkät terävät, kuten sinun herrani.

Ja näin lausui, ja näin lausui, 
tää herra Castameren.

205,dwiqbn,[No Spoilers] Obscure British historico-geographical references in A Song of Ice and Fire,"That Westeros is to some degree a fantasized version of Britain is pretty clear. There's the Wall, like Hadrian's Wall at the narrowest point of the country; and here we have Dorne, in shape so much like Kent: Those features are clear, others more jumbled out of place - bulges and projections vaguely suggesting this or that (East Anglia for example).

We have the Celts (First Men), Anglo-Saxons (Andals)...Westeros is divided into seven Kingdoms as Anglo-Saxon England once was...Even the names Stark and Lannister evoke York and Lancaster...and then we have a Conqueror. The Dragons of course are an Arthurian reference: Arthur was called Pendragon (head dragon): The Ancient Welsh called a war leader a dragon. The Red Dragon remains on the flag of Wales. (Though it doesn't have three heads).

However there are many British references that far fewer people will recognize. Here are four:

*The Blackwater:* The name of the Thames comes from Celtic Tamesa: The Black River.

*The Narrow Sea*: An ancient name of the English Channel.

*The Summer Sea:* An ancient name of the Severn Estuary north of Somerset, the Summer Country of Arthurian Legend. (Also called the Sabrina Sea) (This theme repeats in Summerhall, the Lands of the Long Summer).

*Balerion:* Very similar to Belerion, a name predating ""Britain"" itself: It refers to the one of 3 parts of the island (the southwest) when Britain was known to the classical world only as Albion. A name almost as old as Stonehenge. (For Tolkien fans, note the closeness to *Beleriand,* the part of Middle Earth that sank beneath the sea after the War of Wrath)

Wouldn’t then The Hound need to be revived if he had lost, since Beric’s prophecy wouldn’t be able to be fulfilled if The Hound hadn’t also been around to take care of/also save Arya? Wouldn’t Beric or Thoros have seen The Hound’s part of the prophecy in the flames too?

229,dv40az,[Spoilers] Alternate Tower of Joy Scene,"Thought of a cool alternate Tower of Joy that would change GoT dramatically:

\---

Robert goes to the Tower of Joy with Ned and Howland to fight Ser ArthurDayne and his men. After winning the sword fight, all three men go to the screams they hear. They open the door to find Lyanna Stark, Ned's sister and Robert's beloved, dying in her bed and holding a newborn baby. Ned and Robert rush to her side. She gives Ned the same speech about Jon (Aegon). Robert is shocked and angered when he realizes Lyanna never loved him. She loved Rhaegar.

Ned takes Aegon into his arms and says his farewells to his sister. She passes. Ned looks to Robert and sees the trademark Baratheon fury take over. Ned hands Aegon to Howland, who leaves the room to console the baby's cries. Ned and Robert, who just won a war together, now must confront each other.

""The child will die,"" says Robert. Ned looks at him. He is not surprised at Robert's reaction, but disappointed in his friend nonetheless.

""He's an innocent baby. He's my nephew. He has the blood of the First Men and the dragon.""

Robert can't bring himself to say any more. He's too enraged. He won the war, but he lost his love to his enemy and now his closest friend stands against him. Ned speaks again.

""After everything we've accomplished together. After all the bloodshed and fighting. You owe me this, Robert.""

Robert draws his sword in front of his old friend. Ned musters the remaining energy he has after a long war. Stark, the better swordsman, draws Ice and clashes with his king. The fight lasts no more than a minute as Ned disarms Robert and knocks him to the ground. He throws Robert's sword on the ground in disgust of the horrible situation. He quickly leaves the tower and finds Howland awaiting with baby Aegon at the bottom of the steps. Eddard and his banner man leave Dorne and embark on their journey back to Winterfell. Robert, left alive by Ned, lays defeated next to Lyanna's body.

\-----

After this, the North is essentially in open rebellion against the crown. Ned raises Aegon not as a bastard. Idk if another war happens between Ned and Robert (would Robert win with Tywin's army? Or is his army too depleted after the war?) Maybe in the future, Robert does finally kill Ned but Aegon flees across the Narrow Sea and finds Daenerys. Then they fly to Westeros just like Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters did and they retake the crown. And they rule together? Or Dany rules and Aegon Stark rules the North. (I like the idea of calling him Aegon Stark.)",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dv40az/spoilers_alternate_tower_of_joy_scene/,2019-11-12 06:14:22

245,dua653,[SPOILERS] Thoughts on Cersei?,"&#x200B;

So, I just wondered what everyone thinks about Cersei?   I might have a completely different opinion, but here goes.

I think she's an alright ruler. Probably the best person that could rule the throne  from s4-s7 Yeah, I said it, fight me.

So, she cares about her family above all. Nothing stops her from protecting her fam, and eventually her actions towards other people cost the lives of her children. She's smart. Beyond smart, and cunning. And I admire that. She supports whatever Joffrey and Tommen wants, but she makes mistakes, and each mistake she makes drives her further into up the 'ladder of chaos'. She gets more and more confident, more risky. 

Although, she blames everyone else for the deaths of her family. Her mother and her father on Tyrion, (look, I'm not even gonna get started on that), and she doesn't begin to contemplate that she might be the reason for Tommen's death. Seeing that Jamie wasn't thinking with her interests in mind was probably one of the hardest things she went through, and you could tell that letting him go was a big blow for her. 

I don't know about anyone else, but I want rooting for Cersei when she blew up the cathedral thing. The whole scene had me sitting on the edge of my seat, hoping that it would happen, that some people would escape, and then when it happened, I was kind of glad. Because it was a necessary evil. She knew that Margaery and Loras were pretty much gone already. No matter what happened, he would have a life not worth living, and she would be trapped in the religion, and since Cersei didn't particularly like either, it wasn't that big of a loss. The high sparrow would have been almost impossible to kill, and everyone else in the cathedral would have been calaterol, at least to Cersei. Jaimie, Tommen and the Mountain were safe in her eyes.  The high sparrow was taking over the city, hurting Tommen, and disrupting her alliances. She needed an act that would make her seem more powerful and capable than ever before, to show that no-one could hurt Tommen, or his rule as King. 

Cersei is probably the most cunning person in the seven Kingdoms, and although I can say that her love for her children may make her think irrationally and arrogantly, she's violent, vengeful and a real bitch, but she's smart about it. She keeps the red keep safe from invaders, becomes one of the first rulers to pay off the Iron banks's debts (at least I think she does that) and she makes strong connections and alliances, even though most of them are through blackmail or threats. 

That's the thing about Westeros. None of the characters are perfect, none of them make the right decisions, none are the hero. They're all in that grey area. 

She's interesting, and she's probably one of my favourite characters.",9,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dua653/spoilers_thoughts_on_cersei/,2019-11-10 14:06:21

267,dtbcq0,[SPOILERS] I found out why I don't like Daenerys,"Okay, she has a tragic backstory. She's born into a noble house, sold off like cattle to marry a Dothraki ruler, whom she grows to love, gets pregnant then loses her baby. He dies, and at his funeral, she gets some dragons. From then on, she goes through obstacle after obstacle in order to 'reclaim her rightful place on the iron throne', since her father occupied it before he was killed. She has been through horrible things, and I would root for her just because she's come out of it alive, and stronger than before.

BUT.... I think everything I liked about her was gone after season 1.

So, she wants the Iron throne. Why? Well, because her father had it, and she's the rightful ruler. But, Westeros doesn't work like that. You have to earn the throne, you can't just expect people to bend the knee just because they have to. People bend the knee to Cersei because they fear her. Tywin strengthened his connections, gave people what they wanted in return for allies. Jon united the North with a common enemy. But why would they bend the knee to Daenerys?

She wants the throne because she wants to have the power of being Queen. It's as simple as that. And that's partially the reason why I don't like her. It isn't for the health of Westeros, or for the safety of her people. It's for herself. And I feel like she'd be the last one to know that.

She says she doesn't want to be like her father. Proceeds to threaten anyone who stands against her with her three dragons and wants to rule the Iron throne by force. How similar can you get?

She also has this thing about slavery.

Okay, no-one with half a brain thinks slavery is a good idea, and that masters are good people. but that doesn't mean you kill every master and free every slave in an already fragile society. Tyrion rights her when she is wrong, even though she wasn't even there to see her mistake, to see that gradual progress is better that radical change, to apologise. She says she wants to break the wheel in Westeros. Well, does she know anything about Westeros? Did she even successfully break the chains in Meereen to act as a foundation for what she would do in Westeros? She knows that she hates slavery. Ok, good. But her actions around it are rash and she's unaware of the domino effect that happened around the city.

She has dragons. She has loyal followers. She has a prophecy stating that she will be ruler. And that is what makes her powerful. Not the fact that she may be generous or giving or the breaker of chains. She doesn't gain her power from people believing in her, she gains her power from people believing in the power she has.

She's all about kill now, think later, then feel guilty later and never formally apologise. Like when she attacked Jamie's army. When she killed the masters. When she had that slave problem in Mereen that Tyrion had to clean up.

But, what would she be if she didn't have dragon's? If she wasn't a beautiful woman who could walk in fire?

I don't want to say she was handed everything on a silver platter, because she wasn't. She had to fight for her dragons, for, well, herself and her Dothraki people. But she expected everyone to bend the knee to her without any questions, without knowing what Westeros was even like. How can you abolish slavery in Westeros when you haven't even grown used to the place yourself? How can you become ruler of a country you know little about, a country that you have never grown to love?

TDLR: If the directors positioned Daenerys to be a flawed, ambiguous character, I think I'd like her. I'd understand her more. But the ways she's portrayed as this undefeatable warrior goddess saint breaker of chains stormborn person is just annoying. It's an insult to the potential the character had.",20,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dtbcq0/spoilers_i_found_out_why_i_dont_like_daenerys/,2019-11-08 09:23:37

285,dsgr5d,[SPOILERS] I have a question about Jon Snow in the show.,"As crazy as it might sound, I just started watching all the seasons for the first time a couple weeks ago. I’m a long time fan of the books and knew the show was just going to upset me. 
I’ve actually enjoyed it up until season 5 and beyond. I just finished season 7 but there’s something that is really bothering me. 
Why would Lyanna name her son with Rhaegar the same name of a son that Rhaegar already has? Are we supposed to assume Lyanna knows that The Mountain has killed Aegon and Rhaenys? And even if Lyanna knows why would she still choose that name for her son? 

There’s a lot of plot holes and changes in the show that annoy me but this one is the first one that I cannot figure out at all. 

Obviously in the books Jon’s name won’t be “Aegon” because we already have one of those running around. 

Why did they decide to do this and why would Lyanna ever choose this name?

Edit: I am asking strictly about what is shown in the show. How would this be explained to someone who has never read the books?",35,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dsgr5d/spoilers_i_have_a_question_about_jon_snow_in_the/,2019-11-06 17:05:46

The Umber territory is the furthest North of the Stark lands with only the Nights Watch being further North. It keeps the Wildings from encroaching on any other Northern houses lands and since the previous house went extinct no one living can claim it. 

That being said there is only one I can think of who will be fit to govern the Wildings. He’s the only Wildling of note still left standing, Tormund of (the newly created) House Giantsbane.

I understand that the city would not of cared about him. but there had to be a few soldiers that heard his speech and followed him through the hidden path. You'd think that one of them would've ran into him or talked to him at some point. Letting him know he was brave or that he was a hero. Tyrion could of had a small contingent of men that were loyal to him. But instead, no one gives a flying fuck about him.

354,dq85x4,[SPOILERS] What was your favorite episode of the series and why?,"For me, it's 6x10 ""Winds of Winter"":

1. The soundtrack ""Light of the seven"".  Even though ""the night king"" from 8x3 is even more amazing to listen to, I feel this is the greatest score to come out of GOT.

2. When you couple that soundtrack, with the kind of drama and eeriness you feel in the first \~20 minutes of this episode and the cinematography, you reach the peak of Game of thrones. I still remember the chills and goosebumps I felt after the opening. With the blowing of Sept of Baelor, minds were truly blown as well...

3. R + L = J , The oldest and the most epic theory was finally revealed to be true in this episode, And again, that transformation scene of baby Jon to adult Jon coupled with soundtrack ""The tower"" is truly legendary.

4. White wolf and the King in the north. North hails Jon, little lady Lyanna's powerful monologue and that look from lilfinger. All perfect.

5. ""Long may she reign"". Cersie's coronation sequence yet again coupled with the score is truly dark and scary.",18,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dq85x4/spoilers_what_was_your_favorite_episode_of_the/,2019-11-01 22:23:43

7 hours for 7&8 is pretty damm close to the full 10 episode seasons we got previously the fact that 6 episodes in season 8 comes to 7 hours is impressive

403,dpazzg,"[No Spoilers]""House Of Dragon"" Speculation","The news of a prequel Targaryen show based on Fire & Blood is very exciting and I'm really curious as to how HBO is going to go about this. I could see this going a few ways; The most realistic first season would probably be closer to the beginning of their reign such as the conquest or right when Aegon is crowned. This allows them to fully flesh out the first king, his sisters, and potentially his children as well. They could do that or start from another point in history and run with that throughout the whole season. One possibility that somewhat piques my interest is an anthology series of sorts. With that we would have each episode focus on one specific part of the Targaryen rule. I like this because we're able to see more of the history within a season but also fleshing characters out is going to be far more challenging and most plots need more than 50 minutes to go through. Also if HBO decides to keep this series alive will the following seasons just be continuations or new whole segments in their history. After reading F&B I really thought some of these stories would be insane to see live action and it finally looks like we're getting it. I'd like to hear everyone else's thoughts.",6,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dpazzg/no_spoilershouse_of_dragon_speculation/,2019-10-30 22:53:52

&#x200B;

I just finished season 4 and in my opinion, this was by far, aside from the red wedding the most painful string of episodes to watch starting from The Mountain and the Viper. IMO physically, Oberyn Martell's death was the worst. Just nasty, and shocking too. Ygritte's death, on the other hand, wasn't shocking at all-I kind of knew she would end up dead sometime in the battle but watching her die in John's arms was straight up the saddest thing this show or any show for that matter. I know some people who thought Shae's death was the worst but it really didn't faze me. After hearing her call Tywin ""my lion"" and realizing that she might've really just been a prostitute made it almost satisfying especially after her testimony.",7,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dp0l4j/spoilers_which_season_4_death_was_the_worst_for/,2019-10-30 06:28:00

And the other one is going to be about the North and the Stark ancestors. Now I also know that the lastly mentioned prequel will be released next year and has already been filmed. My first question is about like the form of the prequels. Will they be a movie, a series, a mini series? The other one is if there is any known cast for either of them? And the final is if there is a known year for when the Targaryen prequel will be released? I think not and I think they are filming it but some of you probably know this waaaaay better than me.

&nbsp;


Was just reading this and while there's a lot of interesting comparisons to Jesus, Bran also came to mind with his wolves, ravens, ""shapeshifting"", sacrifice for wisdom, holy trees, etc. What do you think?

&nbsp;


>He is the one-eyed All-Father, who sacrificed his eye in order to see everything that happens in the world.

&nbsp;

>Odin also has several animals. His two ravens Hugin and Munin (thought and memory) fly around the world and report back what they see.

&nbsp;

>Geri and Freki are Odin’s wolves

&nbsp;

>Sitting on his throne, Hlidskjalf, with Frigg in the hall of Valhalla, Odin looked out across the whole world. But he wanted to know everything and gain wisdom and knowledge of things hidden from him. 

&nbsp;

>He sacrificed his eye in Mimir’s well and he threw himself on his spear Gungnir in a kind of symbolic, ritual suicide. He then hanged himself in **Yggdrasil, the tree of life**, for nine days and nine nights in order to gain knowledge of other worlds and be able to understand the runes.

&nbsp;


>Odin was also a shapeshifter, meaning that he could change shape. He could fall into an ecstatic trance and send out his soul, allowing him to adopt the form of another person or an animal. While his body lay in a trance, he could travel as a bird or a four-legged animal, a fish or a snake, through all the worlds and to far-off places.

492,dmnwkq,[Spoilers] What on earth is going on with Bran?!,"I'm on season 6, episode 8 (haven't watched 8 yet). I simply cannot understand what the heck is going on with Bran's plotline. Please, when explaining, don't further spoil it beyond season 6. Thank you!

Okay, so this is what I understood by far:

1. Bran has weird dreams with a three-eyed raven. In earlier seasons he tells Osha of this and she ignored it. These dreams are sometimes prophetic as Bran has experienced the death of Ned through a dream while Ned was beheaded in King's Landing, unbeknownst to Bran. Rickon has these powers too as he had the same dream.

2. Bran decides somehow to go North with Osha, Rickon and Hodor to find Jon in Castle Black after family crisis. Along the way, if I remember correctly, he is approached by Jojen and his sister Mira. Jojen tells him to find the three eyed raven and this tree or whatever. So Jojen and Mira go on to travelveith Bran. Eventually they find Jon in Craster's Keep, battling other gone-rogue Night's Watch members. While Osha and Rickon encourage Bran to go up to Jon and save all of them, Bran is encouraged to continue beyond the wall and find the goddamn three eyed raven by Jojen. Jojen is killed protecting Mira by the rogue Night's Watch. Bran ends up fscing the guy who chopped Jamie's hand off (can't remember his name, sorry). Jon is sad about this later. Bran and the group, without Jojen as he's dead, continue North of the Wall.

3. Osha tells Bran she won't go North of the wall, as it is too dangerous, and won't go back there. The group splits, with Osha taking Rickon away back to Jon and Bran, Mira and Hodor continue to the wall. Osha and Rickon are later taken hostage by Ramsay Bolton who ends up killing Osha, and yes, I know episode 9 will bring the Battle of the Bastards along with it.

4.  I'm not sure if he actually crosses the wall or what, but Bran somehow just pops into this cave with this old weird dude, a tree, and these Forest Kids who have powers. This is where it starts to get messy. By this point, I am missing something- how did he find and get into that cave? I know this Forest Girl lead him, but how did he know where to go? How did he know what is the three eyed raven? WHAT IS THE THREE EYED RAVEN?

5. Now it's the tricky part. Bran connects to this tree with the old guy, and they can see the past together. Simple enough, they can see the past. Apparently the old guy is the three eyed raven, okay. But Bran takes too many risks and delves into the realm of the past on his own. There he meets the Night King who touches him. By this touch, the Night King can now enter the cave, that was previously protected by a spell of sorts. Now it is dangerous, the Night King is coming!

6. Bran watched the creation of the Night King- the Forest Kids were threatened in their natural habitat by the men who originally came from Essos. The Children took a man, and pushed a wooden dagger into his heart, thus making him the Night King. They made him to protect them and aid with fighting against the Andals, but it backfired and now he threatens everyone. I think that was a stupid idea to begin with, but I can see where it came from. Also, Bran's powers were shared by the smartest of the Forest Children.

7. Now the Night King arrives with his zombie and skeleton army. Bran is again connected to the tree, busy with the past. This time he is at Winterfell, watching his aunt Lysanna. He sees Hodor, before he was Hodor, his name was Wylis and he was a Winterfell stable boy. Then suddenly, Wylis falls to the ground and seems to be experiencing some kind of an Epilepsy episode. He shakes and trembles. He starts shouting ""Hold The Door, Hold The Door!"" Until the words become unclear and turn into ""Hodor"". Meanwhile, in the present, Mira and the Forest Children are under attack by the skeletons. Mira needs to escape and tries waking Bran up from his trance state. He hears her in the dream and eventually snaps out. The old guy tells Bran that this is the end and to continue his legacy or work or whatever, and the vanishes ,as he is killed by the incoming skeletons. Bran snaps out of the dream and is taken by Hodor outside. Mira puts Bran on a sled and starts dragging him away in the snow. While doing that, she commands Hodor to hold the door to the cave, trapping the skeletons inside as he cries ""Hodor"" while holding the door. Mira then drags Bran away as Hodor is killed.

A few questions:

1. Did Hodor see his future and decide to call himself Hodor? Why didn't he stay Wylis as he was supposed to be? Why didn't he become Jodor only at his moments of death? I didn't get the whole Hodor name thing and would like an explanation on that.

2. Why is Bran so important? People are dying here for a poor kid with no legs and a very active mind. Why is he SO important? Yes, he will be king, but other people can be kings. He is not the only option out there. So why is everyone sacrificing everything for him?

3. What the heck is the deal with the three eyed raven? Who is he? What did he want from Bran? Why Bran? What does it mean to ""be the next three eyed raven""? Did this man just send signals to Bran to find him with dreams? Why him?

4. What do Bran powers truly do? Change the past? View the past? I don't really understand, since in the scene with Ned Stark's fight in the padt, Ned does seem to hear him in the past. So does Bran change the pasg or just has a look at it? Can Bran see the past of anyone, anytime? I need a really deep explanation about his powers.

Sorry for bombarding you guys with questions, but I need to get these things before moving on with the show! Thanks!",12,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dmnwkq/spoilers_what_on_earth_is_going_on_with_bran/,2019-10-25 02:22:21

494,dmlvoa,[No Spoilers] The Future in a Dream (fanfiction to the tale of the doom of Valyria),"  

**The Future in a Dream**

While Valyria was the greatest city “there is and ever will be” of the known world, many so called dragon riders protected the city. No famous people, just one of the many with no name or special heritage. Not one was remembered by the books of the citadel. They were soldiers. One could only imagine what kind of live they had. Living in the wealthiest city of the world, protecting it, being respected and in company of dragons. And after the doom of Valyria everyone, everything and every dragon was gone. The knowledge of how to build cities like that, lost. The only survivors the world knows of, are the Tagarions. They left the city after one of the daughters had a dragon dream, looking in the future and seeing what would happen. After a few generations of prosperous trading, this family, which wasn’t in any way or form powerful became the most powerful family of the Westeros.

But as the citadel tells this story and everybody knows this story is just that. A tale of doom. Something parents tell the children to scare them, just a story, we tell ourselves over and over until we forget that it’s a lie! Or is it?

The tale of the Doom 

The Valyrian were in the wrong and the world revolted. Some believe it was the spirit of the Roine, which revolted against the oppression of the native people in the proximity of the river, who took it as their god. When the Valyrian poisoned the river, killing the natives the spirit made sure this wouldn’t happen again. Others believe, that it was the biggest dragon who died in captivity and couldn’t become what he came from. Dragons are fire made flesh. When a dragon cannot become fire again, he will develop gasses and if they catch fire no dragon would survive the firestorm. That’s the way the citadel describes the doom. But what really happened only the ones responsible new.

Left to grow strong by itself it grew too strong to control. Like the undying were saying: magic is the strongest in proximity of dragons, and there were many dragons. Since magic was so prominent, in that time, not only respected but searched for, the sorcerers in the black tower used blood magic, to get more powers, the rest of the word wouldn’t even dream of. Using the blood of human children, dragons and animals, they created their own enclave in the city, where nobody was physically able to get in without having their seal of approval. At first, they were supposed to protect the city. They did, they had success doing it, and becoming more powerful, every time they did. Using the blood of the slain armies, they made themselves immortal. Even the most powerful families in the city wouldn’t dare to speak up to them, fearing the consequences, involving living sacrifices. Not of animals but of their suns and daughters. With nobody to keep them in check, they grew too strong. 

Since the mages kept everybody sort of save, there was not much to do for the new generation of dragon riders. Earlier while the city grew in size and not in height, others, jealous of the riches of the city, dared to attack the city and were fought back by the dragon riders. They were true heroes. Defending the city, living for the city and dying for it.

The simple one’s knowledge is that when a beast or animal bonds with a man, the man receives some of the properties of the beast. That way the bravest and strongest man will become a coward, when being inside a deer for too long. In reverse, the nicest and kindest man will become barbaric when staying inside a wolf for too long. Dragons on the other hand are kind of balances for the ones who connected to them. They do not have a personality at first. The first one to bond with them gives the personality to them. That way the dragon acts like you. But therefore, grounds the person who is connected to that personality. That way many Tagarions who lived with Aegon’s dragon, the black dread, were calm, collected and humble. When the dragons died out, these trades died out too. And in its place the insanity made room for itself. Now when a beast dies while connected to a human, a piece of the rider dies with it, but the beast will live in the rider’s head for some time, before the memories merge into one consciousness. Even the dead dragons beneath Dragonstone did its due. Every owner of the castle became much quieter and much more thoughtful, even though the dragons never had contact with the man living there ever after. But not only positive things came to the people living in Dragonstone. The smaller dragons always lived in fear, to be eaten by the bigger ones and therefore developed a suspicious nature. They were so small, that when they died, nobody noticed and their bones were still lying in the corners, on the support beams and everywhere, where nobody would clean for centuries. 

**Sherine** 

While flying, far over the highest towers of the city, something was of. The air was too flat, there were no birds and all the dragons were nervous. This nervous behavior normally came only up when a wild dragon gets near the baby dragons. And then only the baby dragons seem to feel that way. The dragons felt that a massive danger was making its way to Valyria. The most dragon rider went down to the ground to report the eminent danger to the mages, they should know what is going on. Every dragon except one was now down. Sirius, a rider who was trained with me, still many years older than me shouted at me:” Come down, you may at least make some good impressions for the noble boys down there. They probably don’t even know, that you exist, and that would be too sad. A rich family with slaves…” My squint made him stop. “I’m sorry, I forgot, but I’d bet, you would be a better master than all of them bitching and whining girls of the noble families, and I’m betting with you, when they see you, you won’t have a single minute of time alone.” I shook my head. “First of all, I don’t want anybody who just wants me because of my looks, I want to know him or her, I’m ok with both…” I winked at him “And if there is a serious danger coming, I want to be up here. I want to see what’s going on. And if not, well I had some alone time with Merisax. Something I value more than a big house with slaves!” Now he shook his head: “Ok ok, I get it. Well then, we will see each other in the barracks. He was always that ignoring of danger. That’s what I liked about him. He was the only one who could get me of the wall, when I was upset, sad or angry. He would come to me, even when everybody was leaving me. He, his dragon, Serion and Merisax were the only ones I cared for in this godforsaken city. Even though this city had something worth living in. I shouted: “I bet on it!” and then quiet “And good luck for the wars to come.”  The explosion hit the city, when I was high in the air, but it reached us in mere seconds. We both fell, ripped out of the clouds, like ripe fruits. I closed my eyes. Trying to stay calm and let my dragon reclaim security. She felt my trust into her, but she wasn’t able to perform. I felt her pain, her sorrow, that she wouldn’t be able to protect me like the years past. The only thing she was able to do was to slow my fall. She protected me my fall was soft, but my head hit something hard and everything went black. What happened to her, I couldn’t tell.   

When I woke up, the only thing I could remember, was that the firestorm came from the highest city tower. The place, where the mages conducted their experiments. Blodmagic. Forbidden in any other city but thriving in Valyria. They had overdone it this time. After the explosion nothing was standing anymore, only ruins and the smell of burned flesh. Nothing, no dragons no human no beast no animal. Nothing had survived the doom except of me. Because my dragon saved me.

**Chapter One:**

I had to do. No people to report to, no one to talk to, I panicked. I screamed for help, but the only thing that screamed back was the deafening silence. I wondered aimless through the city, hoping to find someone or at least something that could remind me of what I and everybody lost in this city, being it the humanity, the people of Valyrira lost a long time ago or in my case, my dragon, my friends my home. 

While searching the blasted ruins of my home for something useful, I came across the places. Before, I was only able to dream, of entering it.  One of the great city-halls. The place where only the high lords made their business, where nobody but the finest people would be. Something told me not to go there. If it was fear or something else, I couldn’t tell. Not minding these bad feelings, I made my way up the 500 stairs of now blacked marble. It was a stunning sight, just minutes before, now the towers are gone, blasted away, the white, almost blinding sight was gone. Everything was just dark, blackened by the fire. The ornaments watched me with a strange look in their eyes. The bodies had been melted down by the fire. The cracking heat, formed the stone figures, bowed their neck, in an unnatural and unconvertable way. I entered through the main forte. The big doors were blasted open. But I realized, that the grate hall was in quite decent condition. No cracking stone inside, no burned pillows only a few dark spots on the floor. I stepped close to one of these stains, so I could see what these were. They were burned man and women, who tried to run inside. I could see the gems of their clothes sparkle through the ashes and crumbling bones. A Breeze swirled the ashes up and let the bones fall to dust. The air in the room had a burned flavor. It was bitter, and even though I’ve seen and smelled much worse, I vomited. I didn’t realize what fire could do to a body. Ironic coming from a dragonrider, but I was never in a battle before, nor had my dragon ever killed someone with fire. I ran through the main hall, trying to evade the still smoking piles of body dust of the recently deceased. A small room was my save haven. It was the place where all the guardians of the city were lying, who died defending exactly that. “Now for noting, I guess…” I thought. Still the graves draw me to them. I wandered past the newest graves. Gerriues was the last one. He fell from a horse and broke his neck, after riding a dragon for 50 years. It must have been a bad joke for his family, that he was buried here. Visible for everybody. The next one was Cassius the fierce, Tassius, Cassandra the just, the graves reach back to Drius the defender, the first, who climbed a dragon, the first dragon rider and first hero of the city. Probably not the first one who died for the city, but the first hero. At least in the stories the trainers told. He wielded a Valyrian steel sword. This sword does not corrode, doesn’t get blunt or damaged. The perfect weapon. I looked at it. The past years I always dreamed of having one of these grate weapons. It’s not only an honor to have one, but it’s the finest blade one could imagine owning. I took it. Took it out of the scabbard and with the thought, that I would bring it to better use than leaving it with the dead, I named it “Keeper”. As a memory of my dragon, my city and myself and my friend Sirius. So that I would my keep them in good memories.  

I would need to leave the city at one point or the other. I had no supplies and the surrounding was still smoking and burning. The smoke was as dense as a curtain and only let a bit of sun in. 

Since I had too much time doing nothing, I wanted to start doing something. So, I wandered though the city, finding other places which weren’t that bad damaged. 

The great library was close to be unharmed and the bocks only in a very dry condition. In theory the people should have survived in here but seemingly nobody was here in a while... But since there were places that weren’t damaged that badly I still had hope to find someone living. Be it a dog, cat or preferable a human. Strangely the silence that fell over Valyria was sort of nice, living in a city where dragons flew over it, roaring, the mines, the forges and all the humans were quiet now. It was like humans never were here in the first place.

I began to read some books but there were some, that caught my attention. Those were about the mages. They were bound in heavy leather, were thick and heavy. They already had me in their ban when I first glanced over them. They had something special about them. Something I couldn’t explain but I was drawn to them. They had the power to take lives without any warning. And of cause destroy on a scale no dragon could. Not only was I drawn to the books but also the place they originated. It was the place where the explosion came from. I remembered who was responsible for this genocide of a city of close two million. A city even bigger than Kingslanding while the rain of the mad king. But when I explored the library, read a few books, and put them back, I lost the track of time. When I came out of the massive building, it was already late in the day. The sun hid behind the massive fog and the only thing reminding of its existence was a light glare between the clouds. It was getting darker by every minute.  

Most of the ground was white like snow. Except, it wasn’t frozen water, it was the burned remains of the people of the city. It reminded me that I had to get out of the city, as fast as possible. People had to know what the mages had done. They all would have to suffer, what these monsters had done. But first I had to gain vision. And the only place, where I would be able to do so was the tower of the mages. If only one of them would have survived I would behead him right where he stands. 

Before I would have never imagined to be up there. It was the last place a dragon rider would be. As one could represent one´s case before the “wise rulers”, can be named hero of the city and marry a girl or boy of a great family. But to get up the tower, one would have to be chosen by the mages or born as a mage. 

On my way to the tower, I realized, how beautiful the city was. Massive arches, many statures of former important people and beautiful facades. Everything was designed to be as impressive as possible. But I never saw it the way, it is now, before. Either, I was high up, where the smog of the city covered the architecture. Or on the floor, the markets, the people and animals in the city always blocked the view. They covered the beauty by there presence. Now the city was …  
 clean,    empty,   dead. 

**Chapter two:**

I realized, that I would have to hurry, to get to the top of the tower, when I wanted to see further then the light of the moon would provide me. I started to jog, passing the house of the masters, I saw chains, chains which were used to hold slaves, now they were holding nothing, not even bones. No…, I remembered what I wanted to remind myself, by naming my sword. “Keeper” I gasped. Remembering the people, I was once part of. Those chains still held something for me! 

The memories of me, the slave of the city, the people, who build, served and died for the city. Turning left, I stated to run. I felt something pushing me, a feeling that someone or something was stalking me, with hungry eyes, it followed me through the ruins of the street. I turned into the street of the builders, “an arrogant name”, I almost cried out. “They only had the best housings, because THEY had them build by the slaves.” I waited for a response, but nobody wanted to stop me, so I continued. “No wonder the slave masters moved their business right next to them!” Earlier I was always stopped by Serion… I screamed at the ruins of a mansion. The first time I **really** was frustrated.  

The silence was killing me!

I had a headache from screaming and no water.  

And my sides stung, since I hadn’t eaten since morning.

Out of breath I reached one house. But it stood still tall. Not a single window was broken. I stopped. I screamed for someone to come out or I would come in. Nothing, not a single sound was there to hear. 

The silence was annoying me. 

I tried to run the door in. Nothing, the door didn’t move a single inch. Another time, nothing, only a dark “umpf”.  The former owner must have had a mage to protect his home, unfortunately for him, not the owner himself. Ironic, valuing the ownings higher than his own live. I couldn’t do anything else but smile… Impressing what those mages could do, but it gave me confidence, that I had to hunt every single and last one of them. This fight they may have won, but not the war…

Leaving the house behind, passing the street, now sneaking further, I reached the inner tower group. Normally there were guards, not letting anybody through, “keep the peasants out”, like my sword master would have said. Now I could just go straight past it. The strange feeling overcame me coming again, coming closer to the biggest tower. My breathing normalized, wehn I reached the massive complex. I had shivers running down my spine. I realized, it wasn’t only the tower, the highest building in the city, towering over everything, but it was the mages. They didn’t want me in their living quarters, fear me away from their experiments. Keep me out of the place, in which I hoped every single and last one of them died. If not, I wouldn’t hesitate to do exactly that, what the doom wasn’t able to do! 

I stood in front of the main gate. A massive, with steel reinforced wooden double door, made to keep out what wasn’t allowed to be inside.  I stared at it for a few seconds. A really heavy door, nonetheless I tried to open it. I imagined myself using every single mussel in my body, but with a single small push. The doors swung wide open and crashed into the wall behind it. A loud “BANG” echoed inside the building, loosing itself in the ashes around me.

Passing through the gate I entered the first floor. I had to search for the staircase. At first I didn’t want to investigate every room to find it but since only the first floor was as big as the whole library, I had to open every single door. In the every single room I found nothing except coles and ashes of the burned, their pets and interieur. After a long search for this dang staircase, I finally found it, but had to rest for a few seconds. This building was huge, the staircase on the other hand was as small as it could be. Small and high stairs, but extremely narrow. Maybe two little children were able to go upstairs next to each other, holding hands. At first, I wanted to investigate into every room in this tower, maybe I’d find somebody, I would be able to turn my anger, frustration, sorrow and grief against. Many told me, that these motives were the best motives. “These motives will give you strength. They will give you stamina!” 

But I just felt miserable. 

I really never cared much for this city. I was born a slave and was supposed to die a slave. If it wasn’t for Merisax, saving me from that fate, I would have died in the mines or as a prostitute in one of the many brothels. She saved me by choosing me. She hedged out of the egg, escaped the underground breeding areas and ran straight to me. From that day I was a dragonrider and she never left my side.  If I was inside, she had to be there to, when she grew too big, she just watched me from outside, from a window or somewhere else. She trained with me, hunted with me and fought with me, even if our enemies only were bandits or thieves. 

I missed her… 

My thoughts became foggy climbing the stairs. The air wasn’t as dense as downstairs. Additionally, the fog, I now realized wasn’t fog, it was smoke, forming a dome above the city, and I was slowly climbing into it. The walls became pitch black. Everything was black. The stairs and the stones. I felt wired. Somehow there was a light red glowing. But I didn’t know what it was. Suddenly I heard crunching under my feet. Bones. Falling apart like leaves in fall. Not one thought of trying to secure these bones for a burial came to my mind. These People were responsible for the death of millions… and my dragon, my friends. Stumbling over bones that weren’t that brittle, then over still fleshy body parts. There were more people up here than I thought. Weather these people tried to run away from the impending doom or running into it, to shut it down, I could not say. Every step felt wrong. A dark rumbling became every more present, soft vibration in the air were getting hard and forcing my breath to run away from me. This place was empty. No animal was up here, not even a single fly feasting on the corpses. Everything was screaming GET AWAY! But resisting the urge to get as far away as possible I climbed even higher. While the air got thinner, the feeling of danger came closer and closer, I drew my sword, Keeper. Hoping it would protect me, same as my dragon did. The steel was the source of the red glow. It helped. It was not a glow of red hotness. More like blood, that was draining the swords magic and overloaded its capabilities to stay in its form. I never thought blood magic could forge a sword but seemingly that’s how valerian steel was made. And how it kept its form for all eternity. 

The floor became sticky, but the grip got worse, a little slippery. There was a smell of metal in the air and the glow of the sword revealed that my surrounding, slowly but steady, changed. From Chole black, to dark red. What ever happened here, it seemed that the people exploded. Their blood, the last thing to be seen from them. There was so much blood, that the stones were drained in it, every gap was filled by it. Even the sealing was colored by it. I just wanted to get down. But close before my survival instincts kicked in, close before I was about to turn around, not wanting to get lost in an invite loop, I reached the top. A heavy metal door stood in my way. It freaked me out. You could see how the men and woman tried to get inside. The Shadows of their bodies were still there. The last thing what existed of these people were their shadow. The protection of their bodies was visible on the metal. It got weakened at the points where the heat hit it without flesh, ribs and bones in the way and it started to peel off the door. Still a heavy door, I thought, I would never be able to get inside. I thought that there had to be multiple man necessary, to open it. I tried to open it anyway. 

**Third Chapter**

The door made some strange noises. Metal with wasn’t moved for some time had to leave its resting position and brake its bonds which connected over the time. Then I heard a crack and with a scream. The door exploded open. Surprised how easily this door opened I fell after it. The sun was so bright in this moment that I had to duck away, realizing, that I haven’t seen the sun for an eternity. The fresh air was rushing through my body and brain, making my mind as sharp as ever. The explosion must have ripped a part of the top of the tower away, revealing the sky, the real clouds, I was able to touch riding Merisax. A sharp but young voice cut me out of my thoughts. “*who are you*?” asked a small voice. I jumped back, raising my sword. A small figure, with the body of a girl, stepped out of the dark shadows into the room. Shocked that someone had survived and that someone was a little girl. “I´m Sherine, a dragon rider” I heard myself saying, “Who are you?” The girl had now a piercing lock on her face. Locking at my sword, which was still glowing red. “What are you doing here?” The girl asked without answering my question in the slightest. So, I ignored her question too and went for a counter attack. “How did you survive?” I asked with a strong and daring voice. Remembering back, it must have sounded like she did something wrong by surviving. Because this time she answered a bit on the backfoot, her eyes still fixated on my sword: “I believe, I didn’t…” My jaw dropped. Hearing my voice still in a demanding Thone: “And why would you think that?” Holding back my protective instinct and getting her out of here, with all the bodies of the sorcerers. She stepped back into the shadows “Lock around, everybody is dead!” she cried out. I heard her crying, thinking back, I never cried, not even when my dragon died. I just had no one who would ever listen to me when I was little, my knowledge was, that if I want something, I either had to fight for it, or pay for it. Emotion was a weakness, that nobody should see. The only thing I was emotionally connected with, was my dragon. The way I loved her… Tears ran down my cheeks thinking back. The afternoon light colored the room into a bright orange. The sun covered my face, the warm light was refreshing. The first time I stopped to appreciate the beauty of light. I lowered my sword from my defensive guard and let the sun shine in. Taking in as much as I could. Then I felt a warm body pressing against mine. I did not resist. I closed my eyes.

**Forth Chapter**

But her thoughts were not letting me go. Am I alive? Better are we alive? My pulse was present, I can bleed. I had hunger and thirst, but how did we survive. I survived a fall of hundreds of feet and she survived in a room full of dead. I heard tales from the north. People were getting resurrected. There is the house of the undying. The red Priestess from Pentos, the legend says that she can´t get older nor die. But these are only tales, legends. But there is always some truth in a sailor’s story. 

“What´s your name by the way?” I asked. Still soaking in the warmth and the energy of the sun. “I never was supposed to have a name.” she replied cold as ice, “I was raised up here, I was supposed to die up here. **I** was supposed to die, **not** the city!”. I kept quiet. I didn’t know what to answer to that. I tried to cheer her up by asking her that but…

“You said you were a dragon rider.” I still gazed into the evening sun. ""Where is you dragon?""

497,dmb1ox,[SPOILERS] Why did the Dothraki Follow Dany...,"...After Drogo's death?

I know most of them didn't, but for the life of me I can't figure out why any of them remained.

Following Dany goes against their entire culture and she hadn't even done anything to earn enough respect for them to defy their own nature. At that point, all she had done was stop them from raping and pillaging - something that obviously wouldn't earn their friendship.

I can understand why the women might have wanted to follow her, but certainly not the men. And I don't even understand why the women were allowed to follow her - as slaves they should have been forced to follow one of the two new Khals.

Can anyone think of a reason as to how Dany managed to have an entourage with her at all when she wandered in to Qarth?",16,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/dmb1ox/spoilers_why_did_the_dothraki_follow_dany/,2019-10-24 08:03:31
