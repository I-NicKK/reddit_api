1,bv16eu,[NO SPOILERS] FUNDRAISING FOR EMILIA CLARKE'S SAMEYOU CHARITY,"
The *SameYou* charity was created with Emilia Clarke, who suffered through 2 brain aneurysms during the filming of *Game of Thrones*, to increase rehabilitation services after brain injury and stroke for young adults. Here is the link to the charity:

https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/justicefordaenerys

This particular donation drive was started in r/freefolk and r/asoiaf by **u/Elle_Ellaria** in order to thank Emilia for her excellent performance and hard work. It has met with incredible success and received a special thankyou video from Emilia herself: 

https://streamable.com/u6ggd

I cannot find any words to better describe it than those of the original creator :

*On March 21st 2019, weeks before the final season of Game of Thrones was set to air, Emilia Clarke penned a personal essay for the New Yorker. [ link here: tiny.cc/emilia ] In it, she opened up about the serious health struggles she experienced in the early stages of filming for the show, and how she fought through pain, fear and exhaustion to give her all to each performance. Her revelation came as a huge shock; to know that in season 2, while Daenerys was leading her khalasar across the bleak Red Waste and fiercely fighting for her life at the gates of Qarth, Emilia was similarly fighting for hers.*

*She speaks often of the inspiration and source of strength that Dany has been for her over the past ten years, and she is not alone. Emilia’s incredible Emmy-worthy acting and dedication to her character has inspired thousands and, as each season passed, we fell more and more in love with Dany. We rooted for her through trauma and hardship. We watched her triumph over her enemies and struggle with responsibility of rule. We saw her grapple between the urge for revenge, and the need for justice. And even at the very end, when things took a tragic turn for Daenerys Stormborn, Emilia still made us feel pity for the little girl who only ever wanted to return to her home.*

*This fundraiser began in r/freefolk, the same subreddit the now-infamous petition originated from. Since the tongue-in-cheek nature of that petition has flown over a lot of peoples' heads, to the point that it's prompted backlash from some of the cast, we wanted to show that Game of Thrones fans appreciate the hard work of the incredible cast & crew despite their constraints. Any disappointment we felt with the conclusion of the series was not in them, but rather in the potential that was lost due to the rushed pace of storytelling.* 

*And so, as a gesture of love and support from the fandom to the entire cast & crew - but also particularly to the woman who poured her very soul into her character, who delivered passionate speeches in High Valyrian and Dothraki in between questioning her very mortality, and inspired so many of us with her resilience -  I am setting up this page as a public support of her charity, SameYou. *

*ThankYouEmilia for bringing Daenerys to life. Thank you Lena, Nikolaj, Peter, Gwendoline, Jacob, Nathalie, Alfie, Kit, Sophie, Maisie, Isaac, Liam, Iain, Conleth, Kristofer, Pilou, Rory and the rest of the cast. Thank you to all the crew, the special effects departments and set designers, costume designers and casting, musicians and technicians, the camera crew, the stunt co-ordinators, the long list of people who've devoted themselves to giving everything they could to lift this juggernaut of a series to its lofty levels of success and attention. You all deserve to be recognised. Thank you.*


*""Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen.""*

So instead they pinned my new post about the charity (biggest one so far)... go figure. Anyway, it is what it is.

2,36boi5,[S5][EP6] Does anyone else feel seriously ill after watching that scene?,"Speaking honestly here...that hit me harder than The Red Wedding.  
  
EDIT:  
A lot of people are saying that they don't understand how I and others are reacting so adversely to that scene. People have been commenting that much of the gore on this show, or even Dany's rape by Drogo in Season 1 hit them just as hard, if not harder.
What got me here is that we've spent 5 Season watching a character grow up and gain maturity. She has gone from a scared, naive girl used as a King's plaything, to a potential Player / Protagonist in her own right. Tonight we saw her raped by the most charismatically maniacal character in recent television history.
I've become desensitized to the violence and death on this show, but rape is a bit different. Its still a taboo subject and not explored much in popular culture. Hearing Sansa raped by Ramsay after she finally seems to gain independence as Theon/Reek helplessly watches was painful in a new way to this show. Never before have we seen a character work her way from helplessness to independence, only to fall back down the latter. Also, I was watching the first episode again recently, and I still have the image of 13 year old Sophie Turner in my head. God, this show is fucking brutal",229,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/36boi5/s5ep6_does_anyone_else_feel_seriously_ill_after/,2015-05-18 06:07:52
3,blvhkl,[Spoilers] This sub is trying it's best to ruin GOT,"I used to come to this sub almost daily to get my fix for game of thrones. I enjoyed reading people's commentary, theories and of course the reaction posts from people who had recently started the show. Ever since this season has aired, this sub has become almost toxic. Everyone is nitpicking the smallest of details and claiming that it ruins the whole show. Instead of watching with as a fan, everyone seems to be watching as critics. 


I remember watching S8E3 last week and being on the edge of my seat the entire time. My jaw dropped straight out of a cartoon when Lyanna Mormont died and my arms flew into the air like a referee in football announcing a field goal was good when Arya made the kill. I was so excited to come read everything people had to say the following morning on the sub.  Instead, people were complaining that it was too dark for them to really see? People complaining about who made the kill as if the person who's literally been training for years with a group of trained assassins for this moment wasn't the perfect choice. People seeming to be dying to find any negative they could so they could write a post about it.


How about instead of acting like a jilted lover trying to find negatives because the show is leaving you, just appreciate everything its put in front of you for the last 10 years? This has been one of the best shows I've ever seen on TV and it seems like everyone is doing their best to make sure it's not remembered that way.


Jesus guys, it's a show about dragons and ice zombies. Logic was never a priority to start with...


Also, I don't care about the cup 🙄 


Edit: Well after a couple of days of just reading comments as they come through, here is what I feel.  I appreciate both sides of the argument.  Didn't mean to offend anyone with the logic comment. My point was simply that the fact that people are mad about things that they didn't think were realistic are countered by the fact that there's zombies and dragons. If GOT wants to be a bit liberal with what they think the story line should be then that's their choice.  If a dragon and zombies are completely realistic, but the best pirate on the ocean can't shoot down the dragon because of the logic then I don't know where we draw the line. I admittedly am not a fan of the fantasy genre so setting up rules and sticking to them doesn't seem feasible to me if you're going to have dragons anyways. 


For the people who rationalized their disagreement with my opinion in a civilized, calm manner I understand where you're coming from and see why you feel the way you do.  I appreciate the rarity of people like you, especially on this site.  For the people who clearly just come to posts like these ones to throw out insults and talk shit because you think it will grab you a few upvotes, congrats on the few you received.


My overall point wasn't to say the show is amazing and everyone should like it. My point was simply to say that criticism of the show has gotten so intense and aggressive that nobody can post anything positive for the first 48 hours after an episode or else their inbox gets filled with unneccessary rude comments to the point where fewer and fewer people even bother posting anymore because its not worth the backlash.  People like myself enjoy reading the positive posts on this sub and the theories, but now everyone is afraid to even post them anymore. It takes a couple days for the pitchforks to go away at which point I've already taken in enough negativity to not bother reading this sub for the rest of the week.


And to prove my point about it even further, look through the comments. A majority of the comments that weren't shutting on my post or the show were downvoted or met with petty insults. I don't know man, I guess I just wish people weren't so goddamn negative all the time.",244,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/blvhkl/spoilers_this_sub_is_trying_its_best_to_ruin_got/,2019-05-08 00:07:15
4,bkhhuq,[Spoilers] The toxic 8x3 circlejerk is a case of Dunning-Kruger en masse,"The real problem with this episode and community is we've got a bunch of people flaunting their visual illiteracy and arrogantly bitching about ""bad writing"", when all they're suggesting in reality is they'd prefer it if Michael Bay had directed

Skydiving Jon is the worst crap I've ever heard and even at a level down from that people are demanding lines of dialogue and exposition to hold their hands through one of the most fantastic pieces of almost purely visual story telling we've seen in decades.

Moreover, their specific points lack all context and are explicity contradicted by a proper reading if the episode.

(From an earlier comment): 

... the criticisms and suggestions are way off base.

For example:

1.	Arya didn't have the fighting skills - This ignores set up going back to the episode 1 and Arya's first POV book chapter.
2.	 Arya teleported - She didn't. She's shown running there directly in two shots and indirectly in one.
3.	 Jon didn't fight the NK - Didn't he? I could swear I saw a drawn out dragon-dogfight over Winterfell.
4.	Tactics and set up made no sense - Did these people miss episode 2 where Tormund and Edd arrive to say time's run out and they're nearly here so stop pissing about. It's go time.
5.	 Dothraki charge was stupid - Indeed. It's shown to be impetuous and out of step with the plan (See my previous downvoted to hell post about how this fact is explicitly communicated.
6.	 No major characters died - Six major characters died; Theon, Jorah, Mel, Beric, Edd and NK. All but NK have been here since the first few episodes of S1z
7.	There were no shocking deaths - Everyone seems pretty shocked by the NK death
8.	 We see a canonical Winterfell battle map in Episode 2 - it shows that the castle is expected to be basically enveloped and that there is a choke point between the main bailey and the Godswood: Jon and Viserion are heavily implied to be at this point, that Arya must pass to get to Bran. This fits perfectly with the Jon shouts Go theory, which is significantly more useful than loljontriestoshoutthedragondead theory

This was not supposed to be a re-run of Helm's Deep - it took the medium forward - and for the people out there wishing Jon skydived off a dragon to mug the NK in the Godswood should probably just go watch Transformers if that's what good writing looks like to them.

I appreciate where some criticisms (i.e - too dark too often, Sam's over- stylised peril making him appear to die multiple times) coming from but I cannot get away from this feeling that we're being over run by whinging goons who are annoyed that the intentional lack of dialogue and exposition meant they missed the visual communication. I half expect someone to complain about the lack of canned laughter at this point.

This episode didn't spoon feed them sugary rubbish and not they're throwing a fit and demanding junk. 

There's a big difference between being disappointed based on real flaws and ignoring the clear evidence of your own eyes to justify a toxic circlejerk. I feel we are solidly in the realm of the latter here. These are people who'd go to a steakhouse and complain it's not McDonalds.

Edit: And downvoting without responding to a single point proves my point.",543,103,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bkhhuq/spoilers_the_toxic_8x3_circlejerk_is_a_case_of/,2019-05-04 08:28:55

10,bpfi3s,"[SPOILERS] D&D are not terrible writers, this isn't an opinion, it's a fact, and one that's worth remembering amidst all the vitriol.","They are potentially capable of producing instances of bad writing,  both in the moment and potentially in specific long term arcs among the many they are writing,  but they are not terrible writers overall.

the foremost piece of evidence? Season 1-4... them being produced from source material does not make D&D's writing negligible.  adapting anything of that size to screen is a MONUMENTAL task of screenwriting and they ABSOLUTELY NAILED IT.  they are the reason that a vast proportion of us here are even fans in the first place, with 51% of the last episode survey saying they hadn't read any of the books at THIS point,  add in the potential number who've read them since the series introduced them to the books (such as myself) and the number likely inflates massively.

There's a reason that very, VERY few adaptations (particularly book to film) are actually considered good and that's because translating writing across mediums takes significant skill and effort. adaptations can be extraordinarily difficult even in the best of circumstances,  there's no better example of this than Peter Jackson's forays into Middle Earth.  Lord of the Rings is stellar,   but under less savoury conditions, with less time on the script,  less time in production and an increased emphasis on original content,  the Hobbit films were less than unworthy follow-ups.

it's also worth noting that a good amount of D&D's original content is at the very least, pretty good,  sometimes even stellar.  the scenes with Arya and Tywin,  with Cersei and Robert Baratheon,  Battle of the Bastards, Winds of Winter, Hardhome,  The Spoils of War,   this work cannot have been produced without talent, effort and skill.

I for one am grateful for their efforts in the long-run.",83,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bpfi3s/spoilers_dd_are_not_terrible_writers_this_isnt_an/,2019-05-16 21:35:41

14,bkg9f3,[SPOILERS]GoT was never about the zombies and Episode 3 was awesome.,"  

I’m a huge GoT fan. Read all the books, watch the show religiously, hate on George RR Martin for taking his sweet ass time on the Winds of Winter and all that. So I feel comfortable saying this. 

All you people complaining about the whole Night King plot resolving too fast are idiots. GoT was never about the zombies. Zombies were a side plot. GoT is about political intrigue, where you’re not entirely sure who deserves the throne and who you’re rooting for changes from week to week. The real payoff comes when we learn who gets the throne, not how the damn zombies are defeated. People don’t just like Arya for defeating the Night King. They like her for defeating that tired plotline. 

All you people who think the Night King was defeated too fast? I suggest the Walking Dead. That’s on like it’s 1000th season and the zombies still haven’t been defeated, (nor has anyone actually referred to them as zombies yet. I don't know why, that just really bothers me). 

As for me, I'll stick to enjoying GoT until they tell me who gets the friggen THRONE. Fuck zombies and I’m glad the Night King is dead.",151,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bkg9f3/spoilersgot_was_never_about_the_zombies_and/,2019-05-04 05:55:30

16,bl7cmu,[SPOILERS] What is up with the people not paying attention and blaming bad writing?,"I don't know why suddenly there are so many people trying to shit on the writers of the show for things that completely make sense and were set up, yet the person wasn't paying attention or didn't remember those things so they claim it to be ""bad writing"". Let's look at some of the complaints I've heard about this episode.

>How did they capture Missandei?

Right before the attack Grey Worm told her to ""get to the skiff"" which is like a dingy or a little getaway boat. So she literally was on a boat going towards the shore before anyone else.

>How did the Greyjoy fleet perfectly shoot Rhaegal down and then miss Drogon completely

For one, the Greyjoy's are famous archers. Literally in the last episode they were defending Bran in the Godswood with bow and arrows. It's completely plausible that Euron could shoot down a dragon. For two, it helped to have the element of surprise when shooting down Rhaegal. Drogon was on the defense and Dany seemingly decided to try and evade and retreat instead of attempting to burn the fleet.

>How did no one notice the Greyjoy fleet

For those that don't remember this is very similar to last time Daenerys tried to send a fleet to ambush King's Landing, it ended in the death of most of the Dornish armies, Yara got captured by Euron, Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes were all killed. All from a surprise attack from Euron's fleet. I mean his ship is literally called Silence for fuck sakes. These sort of stealthy attacks are Euron's strength.

This is just a personal annoyance of mine, but I wish people would stop trying to argue about exact logistics of certain battle moments in the show. Yes they should still abide by the rules of the universe they are in, but let's not act like a fleet of ships has never got the jump up on another fleet of ships like that before. It's a completely reasonable thing to happen so I don't understand nitpicking.",161,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bl7cmu/spoilers_what_is_up_with_the_people_not_paying/,2019-05-06 08:10:38

I find her character to be a little whiny, obsessed with revenge, and not very interesting.

22,blqgjp,[SPOILERS] Why is everyone shitting on the last episode?,"So many people shitting on the last episode for ""bad writing"" but i don't think it was bad at all. I think it was as shocking as GoT usually is. Just because viewers didn't get what they expected doesn't mean it's bad. I, personally, loved it:

-Dany begging isn't bad writing, her position being threatened is her character flaw and there are so many signs that she might go down the insane lane like her father

-as another redditor pointed out, Jon says goodbye to everyone, as he might not come back as Jon anymore. Being cold and distant to Ghost is a sign that he is starting to accept his Targaryen heritage.

-chained Missandei is not racist, it's the message Cersei wanted to send to Daenerys Stormborn, Breaker of chains.

-Brienne crying over Jamie leaving is normal. She's a woman, not just a cold hearted knight. She's killed lots of men, but she has never been loved by one until Jamie appeared. Of course the thought of losing the only man who was affectionate towards her will bring her to tears, especially when they've known each other for so long and she saw the evolution Jamie went through to get away from Cersei's poisonous influence. 

-Sansa. So many people were disappointed that she didn't keep the secret. But y'all forgetting how much she evolved. She's not season 1 Sansa stupid anymore. She didn't do it out of stupidity, she did it because she saw who Dany is becoming. Plus, you forgot that she trusts Tyrion with her life. They almost died hand in hand in the crypts. Plus, she wants to see Jon on the throne as much as you do.

-Arya isn't a cold hearted bitch just because she rejected Gendry. GENDRY IS A BIG BOI AND HE CAN HANDLE REJECTION!

26,boodv7,[SPOILERS] We need to stop whining,"I've never seen such an over-reaction to a TV show in my life. The amount of criticism this show is getting right now is unbelievable, I'd understand if you were simply hoping for a better result, but to the people that are claiming that the show is ruined -- you are unbelievably petty.

&#x200B;

The three biggest complaints are about the rushed pace, the supposed out of character decisions and the illogical moments. I will agree on the rushed pace complaint, but I don't see how any of the characters are acting out of character. Daenarys at heart was always ruthless, she was simply swayed by her advisors to try a more compassionate approach (which she resisted). When her most trusted advisers died, and the remaining ones she didn't trust, she followed her own instincts and conquered brutally, like they say -- you can't tame a dragon. Jaime returning to Cersei is also in character, as if you've never heard of a longtime couple breaking up and banging other people only to realize why they loved each other so much. As far as the ""illogical moments"", you could nit-pick every single season and find similar illogical moments that were pretty much ignored then, but for some reason are being completely magnified in this season. For example, why did Daenarys leave her 3 baby dragons unattended in a city (Qarth) full of corrupt slave-masters who were quite straight-forward in their interest in them? Not sure, but nobody really cared, because (even in stories) people make unwise decisions. Why did Stannis Baratheon, a battle tactics master, sail right into a death trap and lose half of his fleet, then continue to assault Kings Landing despite the tremendous loss of forces he just endured? He might have won had Tywin not arrived, but still not a tactical approach by any means. Don't get me started about the Battle of the Bastards strategic plans, or the straight line sprint by Rickon instead of zig-zagging. These episodes were still fan favourites because people were willing to look past those small details in favour of the story, and these are only a few examples. It made me realize that people are nit-picking not because of the illogical moments themselves, but because they want additional ammunition in their open-fire rants about the shows plot-line.

&#x200B;

Everybody hopped on the hate-train after the Night King died, and all their personal fan theories that they spent late night hours ruminating about were sqaushed, now all of the sudden the show is a complete failure, and anything they do beyond this point is an abomination. How dare Daenarys get ambushed by the most powerful fleet in the world, when she was literally just reminded about them 2 minutes ago? Well, during those 2 minutes in real world time, at least a few weeks passed by in GOT time (which brings up a valid complaint for this season, it's rushed). It is entirely possible that while hiding behind a cliff-side, he could drift from behind it, then begin immediately letting loose all the scorpions aboard every boat (they're were quite a lot of them) before being seen. He shouldn't have been able to strike one dragon 3 times in a row though, that was dumb, but in no way does it ruin the show for me. Now nobody wants to look past the small details because they don't like the route that the plot took, with the Night King being a less of a threat than mankind and Daenarys succumbing to the Targaryen that (deep down) she always was. These culminations were always  foreshadowed. I'm almost certain that if similar illogical moments happened in a final season that saw everybody's fan theories confirmed, this season would be getting mass praise, rushed or not. They were good theories, but they clearly weren't apart of authors original plan, as the ending is the same besides certain secondary elements. Don't tell me that the only reason the show is ruined is because it is rushed now, because season 7 was just as rushed and although it did receive deserved criticism, everybody has been far more harsh on season 8 for the same reason. That tells me there is more to the story, and plot-directions that you didn't foresee (but could have foreseen) are ruining your ideas of how you thought the show was going to end, and that makes you unhappy.

&#x200B;

This season deserves criticism, but nowhere near the amount that it is getting. 10 years from now, when people watch the show for the first time without the influence of toxic media comment sections filling their computer screens, without the prior knowledge of the leaks (that everybody knew portions about willingly or unwillingly), this season will be remembered as a flawed but decent ending to a tremendous television series. It could have been better, it could have been longer, but it isn't and it suffers because of that --  but not to point that it is ruined, get over it.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** My original post was directed at the people who are completely shitting on the show, calling it a devastation and a betrayal to the fanbase.

It seems that a plethora of people missed my point, i'm not trying to excuse the show runners for their bad choices and failure to maximize the potential of this franchise, i'm saying that there are so many of you that are hell bent on making sure that this season is viewed as a lost cause and an epic failure because of a rushed plot, yet we saw a plot that was just as rushed in season 7 and the criticism pales in comparison -- it actually got excellent audience reviews. I wasn't trying to put words in anybody's mouth, I was simply trying to figure out why so many people enjoyed the show in season 7 despite the rushed plot, and now hate the show for the same reasons in season 8. The conclusion that I came to was; the majority of people didn't like the route that the story took, regardless if they knew the route might happen. As rushed as the writing was in season 7 (and I know that a decent amount of people complained about it), most people looked past that (according to reviews) including myself. I'm sure that there are those on this thread that have hated the show since season 7, but you must be a minority or else this show would've had the shit ratings (that it has now) for that season as well. **Like I said, this season deserves criticism and some of the complaints are justified**, I am alluding to the people that think the show is ruined after the last few episodes --  Like u/ROGER_CHOCS said, it's still a great show.",244,137,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/boodv7/spoilers_we_need_to_stop_whining/,2019-05-15 00:51:26

29,bpmakh,[SPOILERS] I LOVE Season 8 and I’m not ashamed,"That’s right.  From the slow burn of the first two episodes leaving up to unbelievable battle of Winterfell.  From the party afterwards to classic GOT politics to the sweet catharsis of burning Kings Landing.  Loved it.  Loved loved loved it.

So richly layered with constant callbacks to past seasons.  Amazing character arcs that ring true but only once you truly consider their motivations and machinations..  (of course Varys saw her for what she was and virtually gave up, of course Jaime is deeply flawed and went back, of course Dani is a conquistador and wow played everyone using a convenient soft approach when needed, of course Snow is ineffectual when he leaves the north).

And the beautiful meta-ness of it all.  Making you think characters were safe due to the questionable last minute saves during the battle of Winterfell, only to pick them off one by one in the next episodes.

30,34s810,[S5][E4] An explanation to the performance of the Unsullied,"A major gripe many people have over the performance of the Unsullied in the latest episode is that they are hyped up as some of the best or even the best warriors in the world, but are absolutely butchered by the Sons of the Harpy. 

First of all, their weapons and fighting style did not suit the narrow enviroment they were in. But barring that, lets look at the biggest problem. 

**None of these Unsullied have actually fought anything before**

Aside from training and slaughtering poorly armed and trained masters, they haven't actually fought against anyone before. In Astapor, the Masters were poorly armed, in Yunkai, a small ""special forces"" group of Jorah, Dario, and Grey Worm open the gates to allow the Second Sons in. Finally in Mereen, it's a slave revolt that puts Dany in power

Dany was told by Krasnys to ""blood them early"". She did not. The entire time the Unsullied have been glorified city watch and bodyguards. Very few of them have actual combat experience outside of training drills with other Unsullied. 

This could potentially explain why the Unsullied did not defeat the Sons of the Harpy without taking severe losses. No matter how brutal your training is, if you fight in a scenario your training didn't prepare you for *and* have never actually fought anyone, you could be in trouble. 

Edit: ITT people who think the Unsullied should suddenly decide to start carrying short swords despite never once using them in the show, people who think Phalanxes work when completely surrounded, and of course, ""but in the books"" people",94,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/34s810/s5e4_an_explanation_to_the_performance_of_the/,2015-05-04 06:52:20
31,bmif9k,[SPOILERS] Am I the only one who...?,"Am I the only one who is really enjoying season 8?

I don't share most of the complaints about the episodes. The ones I do, don't really bother me. I think that the good outweighs the bad and I rather focus on the positive. 

The reunions we've all been waiting for have been executed fantastically, all interactions between characters have been amazing and I really enjoy the fact that because Dany decided to save the North, her chances of taking the throne diminished. The death of Raegal shocked me more than anything in the last couple of seasons and I cheered when Arya killed the Night King. 

I feel like this season is one of the best but when I come here it seems like the shows is worse than CSI.",130,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bmif9k/spoilers_am_i_the_only_one_who/,2019-05-09 15:08:08

33,bnxltb,[SPOILERS] The writers did not ruin Game of Thrones,"I haven't posted in this sub before but I feel like I need to get this off my chest.

This episode was a lot of things.  Many things happened, much of it with large impact.  And I get that the tone of this season has been different.  It has to be, the show is ending.  But I don't think anyone in real life is to blame for this.

Take Dany.  Everyone is so upset with her actions that they feel like they have to blame the writers.  And while I am deeply disappointed in her actions, I can't entirely say this is out of character.  She is someone who has been told practically from birth that it is her birthright to be queen.  She has become very paranoid and is threatened by anyone who would keep this power away from her.  And for those who say her sudden ""madness"" is unexplained and doesn't make sense, isn't the point of madness that it doesn't make sense?

And Jaime.  I see a lot of people complaining about his returning to Cersei after everything that has happened.  Keep in mind though that their relationship is EXTREMELY toxic, and emotional manipulation like that is not something that can be easily overcome.

I'm not the kind of person who analyzes every aspect of this show, and I don't expect to get all the details right.  All I can try to say is, take the show for what it is, and try not to fall back on what I feel is a rather cheap excuse.  Things don't always go the way you want them to go.  That is the fact of life, and that is the fact of Game of Thrones.

*EDIT*:  Thank you all for your responses.  A large number of you have stated that this issues you are having is less in what has happened and more in its execution.  In that manner, I completely agree.  If the past few seasons had a few more episodes I am certain that a lot of the more contentious points would be accepted.  And for those of you who say that I am looking at the whole issue the wrong way, I appreciate your opinions and thank you for providing your own.  Part of being a fan **is** being able to criticize when what you like is going wrong.  I guess I've always been more optimistic (and less invested here now than I have in the past) so some of the ""rose-colored glasses"" comments are justified.  But I also don't like seeing so much hate being flung around and wanted to provide my own thoughts, even if it was just an immediate reaction following the end.  P.S.

The people doing the stabbing know Jon **better than Olly**, they were his brothers for years. Olly joined several months ago. And he's the only one who hesitates. Possibly, because senior rangers **GOT HIM INTO THIS**.

36,bk72re,"[SPOILERS] The change in attitude of the GoT fanbase, and why it is a shame.","Go back in time and remember when Ned Stark got beheaded.  Remember the grief and shock you felt because GRRM had killed off the one character who was front runner for main character in the show.  This was a quick lesson for everyone who had been watching season 1 that ***ANY*** character ***CAN*** die.  These two words; ""***any***"", and ""***can***"", are key here.  GRRM didn't kill Ned Stark for no purpose whatsoever, it wasn't just a random death in order to shock the audience and make everyone all kindsa ""*woahhh shit mannn anyting can happen*"", he killed off Ned with purpose.  Arya Stark saw this happen, which laid the foundations for her wanting to kill the people who had wronged her family > get trained as a killer and professional assassin > have all the skills necessary to kill even the greatest of foes, i.e. NK.

Thinking back, none of you wanted Ned Stark to die, but because it broke the norms in television at the time, and shocked the audience, it became something people began to accept as a possibility for other characters in the show to happen to.  Just because ***ANY*** character ***CAN*** die, does not in any way mean every character should die just for the shock factor.  The fact many people are salty on this sub reddit purely because there was *PlOt ArMoRu* in a show where *PlOt ArMioUR ShOUldN''t ProtTEst a CHaRcTeR fRom DYiNg*.

* ***Why are you wishing death on characters for the sake of it?***
* ***Why would a load of deaths have been beneficial to the storyline here, over the few impactful deaths we did have?***
* ***Why does killing off characters actually make the story telling better?***

The same people would be complaining if they had just killed off every character, and called it lazy story telling once again.  The season is not even over for christ's sake and people are complaining already.  I will never understand the community over things like this.  It is almost as though people want to get mad at something for the sake of it, or that the series isn't going exactly how they wanted it to/envisaged it to go in their heads.

Wishing deaths on characters in a show that you have loved for almost a decade just for the sake of it, and for it to be ""impactful"" is pointless and actually quite lazy and unimaginative on your part.

There are multiple threads of people complaining about how the Night King was killed.  ""A little girl couldn't just walk up and kill him"" etc. etc. etc.  How about a grown ass woman who has been trained to be a part of the greatest organisations of assassins in the world?  And as far as the people saying ""the NK is main threat of the show to Westeros and mankind as we know it"", yes, but after that threat gets defeated (***if it does get defeated, which it did, because the living won, because that's what the show writers decided would happen***), the GoT is still on.  Just because the NK is dead and the army of the undead are gone, doesn't mean everything in the 7 Kingdoms just becomes **fine** again.

I guess the point here is that ***the show will do what the show will do***, and that is what we have all be trained to understand from the very beginning.  For those that are complaining about this have completely misunderstood the series, it doesn't have to be convoluted, and bloody for the sake of bloody, it is telling a story, and the story will be told how it needs to be told, ***NOT*** how you want it to be told.",154,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bk72re/spoilers_the_change_in_attitude_of_the_got/,2019-05-03 14:54:36
37,bohviw,[Spoilers] “The Bells” would have been 100% on Rotten Tomatoes had the episode been in Season 1 to 7. This was the best episode in the entire series.,"The acting (Daenerys turning mad, the shock on Tyrion and Jon’s face when they witnessed Dany going mad, the goodbye between Tyrion and Jaime), the beautiful cinematography, the CleganeBowl. This episode was beautiful.

Edit 1:
For those criticizing Jaime’s ending: he stayed devoted to Cersei throughout the entire series and maintained this until his death. The first time that he left/‘betrayed’ her was at the end of Season 7 when he headed north. From Seasons 1 to 7, his commitment and love to Cersei were at some times questioned by him, but ultimately remained strong until the end

Edit 2:
For those saying Dany should have went to King’s Landing alone, and left Jon and the gang up in Winterfell: it was Jon rejecting her at the very end, it was Missendei’s death, it was Varys’ betrayal that ended up pushing her over the edge. These all happened after everyone had already head south.

48,bny1h0,[Spoilers] I think this could’ve saved episode 8.5...,"I know people feel disappointed. 

It’s mostly rooted in having these cunning and complex characters built for 8-9 years just to be very predictable, dumb, and foolish in this season.

I’ll get past Varys somehow losing a secret within 24 hours...

And past Jon being in love and ignoring the call to do what’s right (for now)...

Or Dany just suddenly flying faster around the Scorpion arrows and destroying Euron’s fleet in 3 minutes.

Or the very quick “mad” narrative...

The part that bothered me the most is Cersei. She is so brilliant and wicked, but her army and city fall in five minutes and she doesn’t have a single trick up her sleeve? Her wit is what makes her such a good villain, but her forces fall in 5 minutes and she just cries? Like a baby with no plan. Then, they die with the castle falling on them?  She deserved so much more being the enemy to so many.

I think we could complete the loop and have Jaime’s trip to King’s Landing be worth it.

My change:

After killing Euron, Jaime goes to find Cersei.

Similarly, he finds her and they embrace. 

They run through the dungeons, but instead of a pile of rubble blocking the passage to the getaway boat, it’s open. They get in and paddle off.

Cersei and Jaime head for Pentos. She is her old self. Cocky and arrogant and thrilled that her child is going to survive.  That the family cannot be defeated.

At that point, it shows the shore back where Euron’s body lays. It zooms out and you see Jaime’s body, also dead. His face cut off. He died right there on the beach.

Back to the boat, Cersei starts talking about her plans to gather strength and form an army. That they can accomplish anything together. She leans in and kisses him.

Jaime pulls out the Catspaw dagger and stabs her right in the gut in the middle of the sea.

Cersei is mortified.

Arya rips off the mask while she lays there dying in disbelief.  She leans in and whispers, “Leave one wolf alive and even the lion is never safe.”

49,bdguz9,[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones Season 8 Premier Sucked.,"I love GOT. The writing has gotten bad over the years. Every major character has had plot armor until now, and I think that's been the shows biggest flaw since it necessarily brings up events that are too contrived, slower paced plots, and removes tension whenever you put the main characters in danger. (Jamie swimming a mile in full armor, Jon Snow dying, resurrecting, and then not mentioning it ever again. Jon Snow and crew going over the wall, being saved last minute by time-travelling Daenerys, not to mention Jon Snow swimming up from a frozen lake in the same fight after appearing to die. Also ghost uncle. Whatever, that's not what this post is about. ) But I still watch because I love GOT. So after waiting so long to get this?

I know, I know. The premieres are usually ""slow"". Counterpoint: There's only 6 episodes in this season. We waited a LONG time. The story needs to start wrapping up. This shouldn't have been your ""average"" premier.

**Okay, why this episode sucked:**

* Bran - What a waste of a character. ""No time for this"" and all he does is waste everyone's time by being so cryptic about everything.
* Dragon Riding for an extended amount of time. Colossal waste of time that did nothing to advance the plot that couldn't have been done with one line of dialogue.
* Theon comes to the rescue. How? He just silently boarded a ship while no other ship in that entire fleet saw him and his guys go on board. Kills a few guys, takes his sister and done.
* Sansa is all of the sudden the smartest person in the room. Sure, she learned some lessons since Cersei, enough to make her more than paranoid, but most paranoid != smartest. And more than Tyrion? Out of character for both of them.
* They brought Daenerys to see Sam. Kudos to Sam's actor. INCREDIBLE job and the episode's highest emotional impact. However. You are brought before Royalty. Royalty isn't brought to see you. Small and insignificant, just annoyed the shit out of me.
* Lord Kid that wanted extra horses and Wagons only brought in to have someone die on the show**. Cheap.
* Still not sure how time/space works. How is it that Tormund and Gang were at the wall, but yet somehow the WhiteWalkers are between them and Jon and Gang? This could have been something I missed, but I didn't have enough energy to dig into again considering this show's history with time / space travel.
* Gendry. The show still has no clue what to do with him. Let's just keep him making weapons. And also a sorta-kinda love interest for Arya. Him and Bran are in the same screen-time wasting bucket. Maybe they'll ""Show us all"" and have him sit on the throne at the end since he has a ""claim"", but that's just going to be another contrived mess at this point.
* I'm saying it sucked mostly because of how underwhelming it was. I expected a faster pace since we're so late in the game now.

**Cool parts:**

* Arya still has needle. Another reminder of her death prediction by Jon Snow. > ""You’ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.”
* Jon Snow told about his Past. - I mean it's cool that he knows, but this isn't going to amount to anything if he keeps it to himself until the final episode. If that happens, why not wait to reveal it until it actually matters?
* Jamie and Bran. Since I believe Jamie to be Azor Ahai, The Prince That Was Promised, then this will pan out nicely IF Bran is the Night King (Something I don't quite believe, but it's possible). Still, it's the most character development Bran has had to date. Although is it still fair to call him Bran?

**Predictions I still stand by:**

* Daenerys has always been the bad guy, still is. Her look of satisfaction when the Northerners were running at the site of her Dragon - her subtle-not-subtle threat to Jon about Sansa.
* Little Finger is still Alive, and he's going to sit on the Throne.
* Jon Snow dies.
* Jamie is Azor Ahai, will kill Cercei. His missing right hand will at some point turn to fire/be on fire.
* Arya will die holding Needle.

All of the other characters I'm not sure what to do with. Bronn most likely will be the next to die? Not sure how I feel about Bran = Night King yet. There's some validity to it, but I don't know if it's just coincidence from loose writing or nice foreshadowing from a tight script.

50,4khb5i,[Everything] I've been rewatching Season 2 and it's reinforcing my feeling that the writers made a terrible decision last episode.,"The fact that they killed Osha. In particular, I was watching [scenes like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVlRkEqI2T0) (warning, surprise feels), and looking at how Osha died it just did no justice to her character. It wasn't even at the end of an episode or really played as a big deal, she was just killed and that was it. Such an amazing character just thrown in the trash.

I get that this is kind of the Game of Thrones way, but the red wedding didn't even affect me as much as Osha's death. I feel like it's because her death didn't seem to serve any purpose. She just died because that is what is convienient for the plot.

I'm just really really angry, and it's one of the few times I am genuinely upset at the writing. I'm sick of Ramsay, and before this season I even said I *liked* him because he was entertaining. Now he's just killing major characters in the middle of episodes like it's nothing.

That scene deeply upset me, and not in the good way that scenes in Game of Thrones usually do.",52,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4khb5i/everything_ive_been_rewatching_season_2_and_its/,2016-05-22 09:26:20
51,6v02ga,[Everything] Was this the worst episode of the series?,"The fast traveling has been way too much this season but this episode takes the cake. No suspension of disbelief can make up for that. 

Also the entire plan to go north of the wall was ludicrous from the start and poor strategy on Tyrion's part to believe Cersei will even care when confronted with a zombie when she knows the north is their first target. Not even mentioning that they sent Jon north on this stupid mission.

The ice zombie dragon has been pretty obvious for a while, but the way it happened was super anti-climactic. And where did they even get those giant, long chains (in near perfect condition)? 

It's also too obvious that Arya is double-crossing Littlefinger. If she's **not** double-crossing him then she is written *extremely* poorly. She spent that much time training to be tricked this easily?

&#x200B;

The red star is Arya's hymen, when it bleeds Arya loses her virginity.

Darkness gathers of course alludes to The Night king's invasion.

Azor Ahai born again signifies Arya's transition to womanhood through Gendry.

Smoke refers to the forge Arya had sex in and salt refers to the dripping sweat from doing the nasty.

and lastly to wake dragons out of stone is  just some gibberish GRRM wrote.

55,btaak7,[SPOILERS] I think the last season was everything it should have been.,"We waited until they were all out to watch them back to back in one marathon run. After spending the last few weeks listening to the growing disappointment I have to say I thought the end would be some happy, squishy thing where ice and fire came together to form some unbreakable bond and no one died and all lived happily ever after, because THAT would have sucked. But that's not what happened, so why is everyone so upset?

GRRM has never made me feel like a happy ending was likely, he loves brutality and truth and playing on the dark themes of human nature. Everything he teased as promises were brought down by their own folly.

Things I heard disappointed people:

1. They didn't have an epic sword fight with the Nightwalker King- Are you kidding me? Seriously, the guy has insane reflexes, \*inhuman\* reflexes. The entire point was that they cost so much not for a chance to face him on the battlefield man to man, but for the \*chance\* to possibly get one attack on him that could save them all. There was no fighting him directly, he's the big, ultimate evil, only the luckiest move was going to save them, and it cost half the people fighting, at least, just to have that chance.

&#x200B;

2.Denaerys' decent into madness was too fast.

\- A girl who was raised by an insolent, abusive brother who talked about nothing more than his future throne and their rights as rulers, who came into power through sheer destiny (the chance of having dragon eggs and knowing what to do) who has only ever wanted to be queen and nothing else is finally on the precipice of her true destiny. She's in a foreign land, who's people don't see her as their own, her advisers are plotting against her, her lover turns out to be the biggest threat to everything she ever wanted.  She's been at war and getting her way for so long and suddenly it's all falling apart. She's had this madness inside her since the beginning but Jon Snow's revelation only shows her true colors. She never wanted people to be liberated, that was only her projecting her own enslavement to her brother, and a good excuse to pursue power under the guise of being good. She was lying to herself about her intentions just as much as she was to everyone else.

3. Cersei and Jaime

\- This one was great. The entire reason for the war in the first place was their love. Throughout it all, Jaime wanted to run away with her, he never cared about titles and he would do anything to protect her, there was never a need for her to be queen. She loved him, without a doubt, but she also wanted to be queen. Her self worth was defined by her father's lack of expectations in her, seeing her as no more than a bargaining chip to be wed, and her view was twisted because of it. Jaime, on the other hand, crumbled under the weight of his father's expectations, shirking honor, duties and any form of ambition. Jaime was never over his sister and he had never really changed, going north was for her and when the threat to her shifted he ran back to protect her as he always has. Cersei waited too long to give up her idea of power and run away with him, she had done too much, lost too much. It's poetic that when she finally gives in, fate crushes them.

4. Jon and Dany- Love is the death of duty, and Jon has been a man of the Night's Watch for as long as the show has been running, it's all he ever wanted. He was not ambitious, and his personality was inspiring, not commanding. Dany was commanding, ambitious and obsessed, their union was doomed to fail. She would never be tempered by another man, not after breaking free from her brother's clutches in such a gruesome and spectacular way. The most she ever allowed was a concubine, someone who could never claim her throne, and who better than a noble's bastard? The moment his claim came to light he was no longer the leashed wolf she wanted, and yet she couldn't bring herself to think of killing him either. Duty is the death of love, and in order to save the 7 Kingdoms, Jon had to end her reign. Starcrossed lovers, perfect and yet they could never truly exist together, like Fire and Ice.",49,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/btaak7/spoilers_i_think_the_last_season_was_everything/,2019-05-26 21:02:09

71,bk7qu6,[SPOILERS] Many of the audience hating on the episode and its writers just come off as petty and impatient.,"I fully understand the sentiments behind many complaints about E3.

• The survival of main cast seems out of character for a show that's always taken out fan favourites without mercy.

• We didn't get what we believed was the endgame after all that prophesizing, foreshadowing, and theorising.

(GRRM says the books will not end much differently.)

• There must've surely been better ways the troops could have been used even with their highly limited resources and terrible visibility.

These aren't unfounded.

But everybody complaining about their theories being unfulfilled and the character arcs being destroyed—the season. Is. Not. Over. How much explanation did you expect in an episode about a battle?

You've written paragraphs upon paragraphs of everything you hated, right from character arcs to->

D&D have always messed up the shows

how anticlimactic this is

how they set up PTWP for nothing

how they reduced NK to nothing

they deserve all the backlash

they can never live up to GRRM, yada yada.

  


You are allowed to criticize. You're allowed to have expectations. Your complaints are very real. Some of them might be assuaged after the season. **Maybe most of your opinions will still stand and you'll hate Episode 3 even after it's all over.** But you lot should have waited until the season finished airing. You waited 8 years, now you can't wait three weeks?

That shows your impatience.

I just wish you wouldn't hate on the writers this bad. It's not easy, adapting something as gigantic as ASOIAF for 8 years on television, a medium that struggles to fit in huge plots while struggling to retain your attention. I'm not making excuses, but there's a world of a difference between ""D&D ARE THE STUPIDEST WRITERS ON THE PLANET"" and ""I do not like how they've done this episode.""


Tl;Dr: I'd just like to point out to everybody who's writing essays about everything that went wrong about GoT's character arcs, their plot, all your theory based complaints, that **the season is not over.** For you to assume a hundred things before the writers and directors have finished giving you the entirety of GoT is stupid.

76,bm5yaq,[SPOILERS] Is it just me? I genuinely don't know what some uppeople want from this show.,"After last week's episode I have genuinely reached the point where I don't understand what people want. I'm not going to try and argue this season is the best the show has ever had; but the complaints of some people genuinely hurt my head.

Last year people were complaining on there being too much action and the fact that the whole Night King and zombies situation wasn't as interesting as the political themes that were so prevalent in the initial seasons. 

But now in Season 8; when they deal with the Night King first and instead prioritise Cersei a huge amount of people are doing nothing but complaining?

Did people really want a generic living vs dead story as opposed to a Game of Thrones? People are honestly trying to tell me the zero Personality Night King was a more interesting Villian than Cersei? A sociopath that who we've slowly seen become more and more twisted over several seasons? I'm sorry but I know who I'd rather be the Villian.

I don't know. I realised as soon as the show started deviating from the book that it probably wouldn't feel the same (and admittedly things such as the fast travel does annoy me) but I feel like people are nitpicking harder than I've ever seen people nitpick. I enjoyed 8x4; but as soon as I went online I instantly felt bad because so many people are just demolishing the episode.. and idk I just don't think it deserves it.

Is the show flawless? Hell no. We're the earlier seasons better written? Yes. But people have to actually consider the situation that D&D are in. George R.R Martin used to be a TV writer and admitted he made Game of Thrones a book so his story wouldn't be constrained by things such as budget, shotiing schedules, deadlines and actor availability. But now D&D have to take a story, which they themselves didn't start or initially plan out; and finish it within a certain time and in a way that'll be ultimately satisfying.

It's simply unreasonable to expect them to write like G.R.R Martin would given he's got unlimited time and they've got to deliver ASAP. This was never going to be this perfect ending that everyone has envisioned in there head; and I honestly don't think the book ending will be either.

I just feel people are overblowing certain complaints so much it's genuinely absurd to me. I also cannot stand the childish insulting of D&D; it's just flat out immature and mean spirited. They and the actors have clearly put a lot of effort into this ending.

81,4q9x8m,[EVERYTHING] Okay I've got the ultimate theory to end all theories.,"This will get crazier as it goes on, but I think this is perfectly how the final season ends.

Cersei was a huge misdirection. Everything is a misdirection in GoT. Nothing happens as we expect it to, and we keep getting strung along. Eddward will go free- and there goes his head freely. Robb will avenge him! Robb is dead. Jon Snow is a bastard! Jon Snow is the rightful heir to the kingdom. So on like that. But what is the biggest detail about the show so far that has not been misdirected?

The showdown with the Night King. It doesn't happen. Danny comes in and with Jon Targaryen they pretty much just smash and destroy the army of the dead within moments. It pretty much happens like Stannis's fight. Night King is like ""oh fuck, Dragons! I thought those didn't exist!"" He and the others just run back in to the snowy wasteland. They're out of the show. They're done, they can't compete with dragons. Anticlimactic but everyone cheers. 

But now you're thinking, what the hell? Well, the Lord of Light is strengthened by human sacrifice at burning, and Cersei burned a fuckload of powerful men alive! That's when it happens. Jon just dies. Bye bye. Why? Lord of Light's magic was keeping him alive, and he doesn't need him anymore. Oops! Turns out the Lord of Light is actually a demon, a pretty terrible demon at that. Turns out the White Walkers were turning humans in to the undead and attacking humanity because humanity was being slowly corrupted and turned in to the servants of an old terrible god! Danny is possessed by the demon. 

But where does this go? It's pretty obvious now that you're thinking about it. Varys! He's been orchestrating these events now for the longest time. Varys is the demon, and he now has the seven kingdoms smashed and there is little to no organized resistance to him anymore. He has the armies of Dorne, the Dothraki, and Highgarden. The Queen of Thorns is slain and her armies put under ""Danny"" the Queen the Westeros. Through Danny he now has complete power, and nobody knows what really is going on. ""Lord of Light"" becomes the one true god, burning humans to strengthen him are now part of people's rituals. 

Cersei was killed like forever ago by Jamie. Tyrion is still using his politics to help ""Danny."" Oops, turns out that was another misdirection. Tyrion was used and abused, and is still there thinking he's now the powerful hand of the queen, all he ever wanted was respect and he has it now. Jamie is the real hero. Jamie rallies the Lannister army, and Stark army (who are pissed that Jon died) to one climactic final battle. Oh, it also turns out that the Greyjoys are on the side of Jamie! Turns out even crazy rapists don't want to bend the knee to the Demon. ANOTHER MISDIRECTION the Greyjoys are also the good guys! 

The battle is going poorly, obviously. The dragons combined with the like five armies of Danny proves to be pretty much unbeatable. Then you see it on the horizon! It's Joquen. He says ""what do we say to the god of death?"" He removes his face, it's actually Syrio! No wait, he removes THAT face... it's Littlefinger! ""Not Today!"" The Knights of the Vale storm down the hill and turn the battle completely. During the last struggles of the battle Varys removes his visage and becomes a true demon. Him and Littlefinger have one last conversation. Littlefinger knew all along and was doing anything he could to amass enough power to stop him! The chaos of the Demon's bid for power was all he needed. The Demon slays Littlefinger, but not before Littlefinger gets a dagger in his stomach. Then comes in Jamie! 

The Kingslayer, no wait, the GODSLAYER takes the opportunity to kill the Demon once and for all.

82,bjgidw,[SPOILERS] The show handled the Night King well,"I have seen a number of people complain about how the Night King's death was handled too easily and in an anti-climactic way. They complain that they didn't see him fight or engage in combat with any of the major characters. But in my opinion that would have been the thing that would have turned it all anti-climactic, the Night King fighting Jon in a duel for example. Please, hear me out.

&#x200B;

The Night King actually has been fighting all the characters, all the time. The Wights are - from the way I see it - extensions of himself. They're raised from the dead through his power, they're chained to his will and obey his every single command. In a sense, they are him and he is them. When Jaime or Brienne or anyone else fights the Wights, they're basically fighting parts of the Night King himself. 

&#x200B;

The Night King is so powerful that he simply doesn't need to engage anyone directly, that's what makes him such a dangerous villain. The fact he can raise the dead and keep raising the dead at will, completely elevates him above the need for direct combat. Fighting someone in a one-on-one duel is below him. He'll simply have the dead fight you and kill you instead. And if through an unusual flow of luck you do manage to kill enough of his army, the Night King will simply raise your dead and have them fight for his cause. It makes those moments when he actually does draw a weapon to kill someone so much more significant and symbolic.

&#x200B;

Yet all this power, all this might he has, the very thing that makes him seem so invincible and almighty, it's simultaneously also his greatest weakness. Because if you end him, his entire army and might shatter alongside him. That's why he can't risk engaging in combat directly as well, he is careful and cautious as anyone with great power should be. Because even though he seemed unbeatable and eternal, he was **created** after all, created **from** mankind. He is not a god or a divine entity, he was created by the Children of the Forest nearly the same way Uncle Benjen was saved by them. That made the Night King mortal (in a relative sense), because everything that is created can also be undone. 

&#x200B;

All of that is why I think that the way he was destroyed, was the most perfect way they could have gone about it. He was too cautious, too wise, too deliberate, too patient to be killed in an epic duel or through some other means. But the Night King had one blind-spot: overconfidence. And Arya took advantage of this in the most brilliant way possible.

&#x200B;

Arya is a master at being quick and silent. Look at how she moves in the library with all the Wights roaming around there. Stealth is her game and she is a pro at it. Now, look at how she comes at the Night King, she storms -screaming- at him. That's not Arya-like, not at all. But in fact, it simultaneously is also the most Arya thing to do. Why? She lulls the Night King into settling into his blindspot, grabbing her by the throat and arm, letting him believe he has defeated her. Then she drops the knife and stabs him, having completely blindsided him and therefore, beaten his wit, his wisdom, his patience and his caution. This was the only way you could kill the Night King: outsmart him, which Arya did masterfully. By screaming loudly and basically announcing her presence, she purposefully made the mistake of every single person that tried to kill the Night King thus far: simply charge at him. This pushed him into his blindspot of overconfidence, because to him this was yet again another fool that tried the same old tactic for the umpteenth time. Yet Arya was prepared, Arya knew exactly what she was doing and how she was coming at him. This was how she defeated the Waif chasing her in season 6 as well, she lulled her into believing she had Arya wounded and scared, which our brilliant little Stark then masterfully exploited.

&#x200B;

This is why I believe that the Night King's death was handled brilliantly. Winterfell was the all or nothing situation, the place where the living would beat the Night King or be destroyed by him. We didn't need more on why the Night King does what he does, acts the way he acts because we already know that and have known from the start: he is death and all he wants is death, everywhere on the world and forever. Bran says it and Sam confirms it with his assessment in episode 2. That makes the Night King scary and ominous enough, any more motivations or reasons for his malevolence would undo that enigma around him.

&#x200B;

To me, Episode 3's ending and the end of the Night King and White Walker threat was perfectly handled. Any other way would have made it seem too arbitrary or forced and if the living lost the Battle of Winterfell then there wouldn't be much left to do for the series, now would there? There is enough of a threat still out there, because fearing death is easy and simple. Fearing a malevolent mortal like Cersei? That is much more intricate and complex, if you ask me. ",501,326,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bjgidw/spoilers_the_show_handled_the_night_king_well/,2019-05-01 16:29:27

85,27o0hw,[Spoilers All] For the first time I can say I think D&D blew it.,"The opportunity to end Season 4, Episode 9 with a HUGE moment from the books was just ruined by their decision to end the episode where they did. [Spoilers AFFC](#b ""Ending this episode without the arrival of Stannis and his army to save the Wall and the Night's Watch"") was a major letdown, and I believe a poor choice. It should have been the capstone to a great episode, but now it will be pushed to the finale. I think now that moment, even if it comes at the very end of the season's last episode, will be comparatively lessened due to all the other major events which must occur in episode ten. Where it could have been the ultimate *gasp* for Ep. 9 this year, leading into the conclusion, it now will have to compete for attention with other pivotal scenes. I'm so disappointed by the decision, and because my girlfriend is currently reading AGOT I can't discuss it with anyone here. I can't help but feel that it was a serious error to exclude it from this week so that the finale's plots could be limited to 3 or 4 major moments to be played out. I know lots of others were also waiting for the expected event to occur tonight, but I'd like to know if any of you see it as a big letdown or one of the show's real ""you blew it"" moments.",35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/27o0hw/spoilers_all_for_the_first_time_i_can_say_i_think/,2014-06-09 06:49:45
86,bobjcn,[Spoilers]So sick of the negativity,"I feel like the internet zeitgeist is excessively propagating and growing the hate for this season.  

I saw one complaint meme about Jaimie’s arc, saying ‘what was the point’ of his character arc if he just went back to Cersei.  I saw other complaints about character arcs not being some ideal perfect follow through - when the hell has anyone in this series gotten a storybook character arc?

How many characters have been built up, and a fascinating story woven, for them to suddenly die?  This whole show has been about subverting expectations. 

You expect a storybook fulfilling arc?  You sure as hell are looking in the wrong place for it. 

The point is the journey. The point is the entertainment we got along the way.  Watching characters change, grow, suffer, and triumph. 

The ending would never be a clean perfect arc, tied in a neat bow, for every character.   People had this idea in their head that something miraculous or totally unheard of or imagined should come of the end, but reality isnt whatever they imagined, or hoped, and they’ve got sour grapes. 

The internet is just bitch, bitch, bitch, and I feel like it’s turning everyone negative. 

When the whole internet seems to be bitching, it makes you feel bad if you’re having fun. So no one is going around raving about enjoying it, because the public narrative is that D&Ds writing is awful and we should all feel bad. 

I love this season.  

I’m totally enjoying it.

87,bu3m06,[SPOILERS] The show runners finally told us what Podrick did with those whores...,"Imagine Podrick Payne when he was left alone in that room with the prostitutes. The door closes, and he, a young squire with NO experience with women, is left alone with three -- beautiful, naked, and presumably, down for whatever.

All we know is that he left that room smiling and with a pouch full of coin -- those women gave the money *back*. For years, the question has lingered: what the hell did Pod do in that room? We will never know for sure as it was never directly addressed, but consider what we do know about Podrick Payne: He is honorable, loyal, gentle, maybe a little bumbling, and maybe less clever than that. But in S8E2, we also learn that Pod has a beautiful singing voice.


So, based on what we've seen of him from the show, I think the precious little evidence we have about the mystery points in only one direction. The inexperienced squire was no sex god, but just an innocent boy with the voice of an angel. When it became clear that he was completely uncomfortable with the idea of sleeping with those women, he started to sing to them. Rather than press the attack, the women listened and smiled, and maybe they made requests which Pod performed with as much aplomb as he could muster. Then, when the impromptu concert ended, the ladies concluded that Podrick was the one rendering a service this day, and taking his money just wouldn't be right. They thanked him and sent him on his way with a smile on his face.

89,bpmgrq,"[No Spoilers] Unpopular Opinions, please don't downvote into oblivion","I'm really excited for the finale, and loved everything about episode 5.

&#x200B;

I also want to defend D&D quickly. Before I do that - because I know saying anything positive about them will probably get this post downvoted faster than you can say Dracarys - I am not denying the drop in quality in seasons 7 and 8. They are not as good. There is no denying that.

&#x200B;

However, ever since I heard that the last two seasons would be shortened, I assumed it was because D&D were not confident that they would be able to write good character interaction and development the same as they did with source material to go off of. I assumed their thought process was as follows: ""Writing 2 or more fully fledged out and developed seasons is an incredibly daunting task that we are seriously doubting our ability to pull off. Committing to that is a seriously high-risk task, so why don't we shorten the seasons and focus on doing justice to the big plot points that we have to cover, as that is much lower risk.""

&#x200B;

It feels rushed. However, I'm betting that 2 shortened, rushed seasons are still better than if they had attempted to write 2 fully fledged seasons and terribly fucked up character development. The characters' actions in recent episodes are not at all out of character, they just feel that way because the development in between plot points is lacking. I'm betting the content we got is far better than the alternative.

&#x200B;

With that said - and getting to my unpopular opinion - I have loved every episode except episode 3 this season. Episode 5 will go down as an all-time classic in my books, and episode 2 almost does, but given the let-down of episode 3 the emotional impact episode 2 was meant to have falls short. And lastly, I am seriously looking forward to the finale, as I thought episode 5 was a perfect set-up. It's really starting to hit me that I'm going to have to say goodbye to this show that has been such a huge part of my life for about 6 years. HBO, you did a fantastic fucking job. Even with the last seasons. They have issues, but I think most of us will admit that they're still far better than most of what's on television.

back to my point. these people are always going into battle with each other, they're probably really tired. it seems pretty silly because if they used all the time and energy they spent fighting, they could all just build their own got damn thrones

I read them a long time ago. I love the shows adaptation and I’m still having a great time watching this show. 

I can’t blame the mods, but I don’t get to watch the show for 2-3 hours after release and my front page is bombarded with negative posts that should be be contained in larger general posts. The same discussion happens in 30 threads about how bad the show has gotten. 

It’s really disappointing. I went two weeks avoiding Endgame spoilers and I realized that’s because I’m not subbed to Marvel subreddits. The easiest way to go back to having a good time watching a TV show is to bow out of negative places like this and just appreciate what I’m getting. 

I’m not looking for confirmation bias and understand there are flaws to the show. But I don’t feel like I’m part of any discussion because if I disagree with anyone I’m downvoted beyond any discussion and left voiceless.

107,7zkxw1,"[EVERYTHING] Season 7 is absolutely terrible, what even is this show anymore?","I know the show steadily dropped in quality ever since it started moving more and more away from the books, and a drastic change was going to happen once there was no more book material to work from. It was an inevitability - GRRM was the great storyteller, the showrunners were only ever tasked with adapting the story for the screen and writing around the most crucial parts. They don't have GRRM's creativity or ability, but I don't think anyone expected that they would end up having to continue the damn thing on their own. When a goldmine has run dry but the project isn't completed, you have to use the whatever nuggets of gold you have left wisely and make do with bog standard bronze for the rest of the task. So fair enough, the show is what it is, and had no choice but to become a creature of its own.


But *what the fuck* is season 7? I thought I'd check it out for a bit of light entertainment, but I haven't been able to suspend my disbelief once. So many, many things are so illogical and unbelievable. 


Why did Jamie run at the dragon? How did he survive a plunge into water with full armour - why was the battlefield completely clear by the time he came up for breath? What was the point in the Dornish lady takeover if they all just get killed before accomplishing anything? Whats the point in Gendry returning? Whats the point in Benjen returning? Why does Jon Snow, such a crucial political figure, make himself part of the expedition to the wilderness to capture a wight? Why did *he* have to be there and put himself in such suicidal danger when he had a perfectly capable team of expendable men to do the job for him? What kind of plan was 'capture a zombie and show it to Cersei' anyway? How did they not get overrun **in seconds** when they were surrounded at all sides - why did they use a bunch of camera shots for minutes upon minutes making it out like the horde was running at them one by one? Why did Jon not get on the dragon straight away instead of running out and fighting stragglers before falling into a hole?

The relationship between Jon Snow and Daenerys came out of absolutely nowhere. A couple of conversations about their duties and pasts, Tyrion saying ""he's in love with you"", Daenerys saying ""no he's not"" and while thinking ""ooh might he be?"" and then she saves his life and then they're together. It was sudden and forced and while it might make sense thematically (fire queen and ice king get together, song of ice and fire, yada yada) there was no convincing relationship development. Grey Worm and Missandei had more build up, screen time, chemistry and reason to be together - and that's saying something! It must have been done for fan-service, because people wanted Jon and Khaleesi to be together, or because the actors dated in real life, or just because some writer or show-runners thought it would be cool. Perhaps it happens in the books - but it would take a hell of a lot more than a few dry conversations, an explanation from Tyrion and then a deus-ex-machina wow-just-in-time! rescue scene to develop that relationship to a believable standard.

Emilia Clarke shows the same level of emotion when she arrives in Westeros, as when she rides her dragon, as when her dragon dies, as when she's burning someone alive, as when she meets Jorah, as when she says goodbye to Jorah, as when she does anything else. There is nothing in her delivery. It's constant stern-face stern-voice for everything, except for those times when she's calm and smiles a little. She over-pronounces every word and puts on a 'queenly' voice and that's the entirety of her line-delivery. She's a terrible actress. Scenes with her are unbearable. It's even more obvious when she's in a room with decent actors how incapable she is of giving a decent performance. Maybe it's the writing, or the scene direction - maybe the writing and scene direction is like it is to accommodate Clarke's lack of skill. Whatever's happening, it's awful. What should have been a momentous scene, her first arrival to Westeros, turned out to just be Clarke picking up some sand and looking a bit happy, walking a long distance to some epix music and then saying a cringe line. 

Who is this show's audience? It can't be the people who like the intricate story, because the story is no longer intricate - it's just a mishmash of average plot points, stupid plans, characters reuniting with underwhelming meetings, and fight scenes - bumbling on from one thing to the next. It can't be the people in it for the politics and intrigue - the conversations don't have good writing, there's no choice lines, the politics don't make sense, the narrative lacks complexity. It can't be the people who watch it for shock value - because nothing is particularly shocking. Oh, Jamie fell in a pond! Arya and Sansa fall out over a letter! Olenna finally confesses to poisoning Joffrey! (for the 5 or 6 people who still haven't realized that). Is it people who watch it for sex? No, there's no sex. So who is it? People who just want to see dragon CGI, zombies and Jon and Daenerys getting together?

The majority of the seasons, for all their flaws, remained entertaining. The book material was adapted well most of the time, and there were some really excellent newly created material. They handled some plots as well as they could, and did real justice to some scenes. They cut out some unnecessary fat that they couldn't really do much with (eg. Lady Stoneheart) and added in some material that was well written and fit the narrative. Many questionable scenes still managed to be exciting and interesting in their own way, while the really trash scenes were sporadic and glaringly obvious. There was a lot of guff and filler, but there was still a good amount of gold. In season 7, it's all shite.

I just had to get this off my chest, but please, if you're someone who still enjoys Game of Thrones, please explain why. Sell me on it. Does it have some merit that I've missed? Whats the deal?

Because the only reasons I can think of for someone still liking Game of Thrones are that they like it because they like dragons and zombie fights and they don't think about things making sense as long as Dany and Jon get together, and maybe they remember how good the show used to be but can't quite remember why so they just expect it's probably still good - because it's GAME OF THRONES, right!?! Winter is coming! Dracarys! Cunts!

108,blasz9,[SPOILERS] There are still plenty of people who still enjoy this show. The constant hate is determined to ruin that enjoyment for everyone.,"I know there’s been some posts like this so I might be repeating some points that’ve been said. It’s fine if you don’t agree with me and you think the hate is all justified. But let me explain from the point of view of someone who still enjoys it:

Originally I thought  we were all here because we enjoy this show, for one reason or another, and we want to see what the end has in store for characters we’ve followed for years. These past few weeks have changed the purpose of this sub/other GOT forums. 

The hate towards GOT has been slowly building up since season 5, but it’s never been this unbearable. Every week since season 8 started, I get on the internet after an episode to geek about it and talk about it and even criticize it if it needs to be criticized. But every week I leave the internet (reddit especially) feeling like shit for actually still enjoying this show.

Yes the writing is not the complicated crazy development and rich storytelling it used to be. It hasn’t been for a while. But the constant circle jerk about how s1-4 is God’s gift to humanity is exhausting. Season 5-8 are not the same as the first seasons but they are not garbage. And if it is garbage to some I don’t understand why they’ve stayed tuned for the past 5 years or so if the show is so bad. It just baffles me that these people still call themselves fans and enjoy none of the content

I am not saying we can’t criticize the writing or some of the choices. But the endless negative energy of “how hard can we shit on GOT this week” is really tiresome for people who just want to be able to talk about a show they love and enjoy with people who also enjoy it. It’s gotten to the point where I’ll finish an episode with excitement and reddit will change my mind and make me see all the bad things in it and none of the good because of the hate. 

The Long Night was an enjoyable episode for me. I didn’t like some of the choices like no NK background, too many survivors etc. But I still loved the episode. There are really people on here saying it’s hot garbage and that we’re mindless idiots for loving it. Same thing happened tonight after episode 4. People didn’t agree with some things so suddenly the whole episode is trash. It’s terrible.

Instead of being hyped and excited for the final 2 episodes I find myself dreading how much more hate is going to come from them because people are not getting their endings/predictions right or because their fav died or because the writing isn’t as unpredictable as the books. 

I wrote all of this because I just want people to know that while it’s OK to criticize the show for bad choices or writing, the endless threads of hate and shitting on the show are exhausting for people who still love the show. And if you’re still a fan of the show and enjoy it I know you’ve seen it too and might feel this way. Everyone can have their opinions but not when those opinions start to overshadow everyone else’s and ruin the point of this sub which is to discuss and review a show we all (supposedly) are fans of. And not just endlessly shit on everything the show does. 


TLDR:

The hate threads are exhausting to people who enjoy the show. Criticism is fine but not when it becomes “my opinion is right because others agree.” That’s when it becomes more than criticism and just becomes hate wagon. 

The show has still been good after season 1-4. People need to stop acting like season 5-8 are completely trash. 

If you still enjoy the show you are not incompetent. Don’t let the hate make you believe this show is trash just because people still want season 1-4 levels of writing.

115,6vcydl,[NO SPOILERS] - The criticism is starting to annoy me,"I don't understand what makes anyone think they have the right to complain about the show or judge the writers. I could see maybe if there was without question inconsistencies and things going on that are just totally not plausible, but there's been none of that. The entitlement that some of you are projecting is ridiculous. I'd like to see any of you try to write anything as well as this.  Even if it is not as good as other seasons, it is still by no means bad writing. I believe some people have no knowledge or respect for the amount of work that gets put into this show and also need to realize that it is just a FANTASY TV SHOW. Not everything has to make perfect sense 100 percent of the time and I'm not saying it doesn't (make sense). Like many have said, D&D didn't sign on to write this show they signed on to adapt it. they're finishing something the original author is having trouble finishing and they're doing it with much more limitation. Time constraints being the main one, money, what's possible on tv, making sure it's all good with GRRM, the fans and who/what they want. All these things factor in. With all that in mind, and the fact that they wrote season 6 from scratch which is arguably  the best season, I think they are doing a fantastic job and are delivering a compelling and exciting story. Even if there have been some mistakes, I'd say they earned some leeway.  I think anyone who nitpicks needs to take a step back and just enjoy the show, appreciate the work and effort that goes into it and the fact that it even exists in the first place.

118,4nvibz,"[EVERYTHING] This episode isn't bad, you guys are just ruining the show for yourselves.","Let's get one thing straight, what makes Game of Thrones the best show to ever air on television isn't the gore, the tits, or the shock value. What is so good about GoT is the quality of the writing. Good writing is about complex characters following their arcs, whether those arcs end in blood, rape, or happiness is irrelevant. 

However, recently fans have forgotten the importance of good stories and are just focusing on the shock value of the show, and their own incredibly far fetched theories. I'm look at the clegane bowl, the Jon snow dog theory, the recent arya theories, and the hundreds more that never came true. It seems every episode there is a new theory and more ""evidence"" confirming old ones, but let's be realistic for a second here. Let's assume that all your favorite theories ARE true. They shoot them, they air them. Now what? How have these theorized events served to further the character arc of these characters? How have these theories fixed the actual issues with the writing? Most of the time they don't if anything they often betray the progress the character has already made.

Let's look at the clegane bowl, let's assume that it does happen right. If the hound loses, what would that accomplish? Nothing, he literally came back to life, went down to King's landing, and died, again, for no reason. That's a waste of time, so in order for it not to be a waste of time the hound would have to win. The problem is, that because of the very reason i just mentioned, everyone would already know the hound is going to win. Even if he does win, where does that leave us? Cersei gets killed? How does that fit into her character arc? It'd be a horrible ending to one of the most important characters in the show, for what? The sake of the hound's revenge? First of all the hound getting revenge would destroy his own character progress of going from a brutal man to a peaceful one.

See what I'm getting at? That would be bad writing.

Which brings me to my next point, the show already has bad writers, we don't need fan's giving these writers more ideas. GoT has been a success due to the writing of GrrM, the show writers themselves are mediocre, just look at all stuff they've done that wasn't based on the books.

We know how susceptible these insecure writers are, look at what they did to Dorne for the sake of empowering women... Dorne could've been one of the most bad ass plots right now. Doran Martell is one of those guys playing the game, and he had (has) plans for revenge. Right now, the every major house in the 7 kingdoms is shaky, EXCEPT the Martells. The Tyrells are dealing with the faith, the Lanisters are collapsing from within, the Eyrie is Littlefinger's playground, the baratheons are dead, the Starks and the Tullys are both experiencing internal conflict. If there were ever an opportune moment for Dorne to strike it'd be now. Instead we get bad pussy.

Instead of creating stupid fan theories about that one character who showed up in season 4 for 2 seconds, and is actually a faceless man who was ned stark all along, let's just watch the actual show. 

Now, i'm not saying the episode didn't have flaws. They butchered the Riverlands, they've been butchering essos (both mareen and arya) for a couple of seasons now, but that's not what all of you are whining about. You're whining about your stupid theories that got unconfirmed. 

Jaime's choice this episode was completely spot on. Jaime is a conflicted character. He's not sure of what's right or wrong, however if he just said ""oh Brienne, you're right i am evil, i pledge my men to the starks, lets take back winterfell"" that'd be complete bullshit. Him being on the edge of redemption and damnation is what should be happening. We see he is indeed having internal conflicts from his conversations with both edmure and Brienne, and while his conscience is pulling him one way, his love is also pulling him another. Compare this Jaime, to the one in season 1 when he pushed bran off without regret or second thought. This one would probably still push him off, but he'd regret it, or would show hesitation. That's character development. It's slow, but it's happening.

Arya's writing was pretty stupid, the way she was acting so arrogantly even though she KNEW she'd be hunted down was just unrealistic and dumb. Not to mention a 10 minute chase sequence while having serious injuries... However, her saying ""I am Arya stark"" is actually good. Consider her character Arc. She is a girl who always struggled with her identity. She was a girl who always acted like a boy (historically, don't get all feminist), she had to change her name and disguise herself half a dozen times in her travels through westeros. She was dealing with a very real identity crisis. However, she finally found herself. She is Arya Stark. I don't get why Jaquen said ""a girl is finally no one"", but let's try not to read into it and create some stupid fan theory like ""he said she is finally no one because she's actually the waif and arya stark is dead"".

119,55dywo,[EVERYTHING] S6E10: Was this scene unsatisfying for anyone else?,"Overarching edit: replace ""unsatisfying"" in the title by ""not compelling in terms of character development"". People are misunderstanding me :/ I didn't want the Starks to go south and destroy every family, I just wanted a more compelling end to Arya's already-lacking show arc. Just imagine a small legend spreading in Riverrun about a deadly and mysterious assassin, who we viewers know to be Arya, and her re-appearance next season with perhaps another killing, on-screen this time. 

TL;DR: Arya's scene in S6E10 was an unsatisfying revenge to the Red Wedding. I have 3 ideas of how it would've went better imo. Please change my mind on the scene. 

Edit: So a lot of people are saying that I am desensitized to violence. If that is the case, why would I suggest that the best end to Arya's season 6 arc is an off-screen end? When I said ""unsatisfying"", I didn't mean I wanted a gruesome death for the Freys, I meant a more compelling and mysterious way of developing Arya's storyline instead of a shock scene. Just imagine she becomes a small legend in Riverrun before re-appearing next season. And to people saying I'm a sadist, I'm not the one who cheered when Walder (a human being) ate his sons (also human beings) and was killed by Arya. Just saying ;)

When Arya takes revenge on the Red Wedding in S6E10, did the whole scene seem unsatisfying to anyone? We don't see Black Walder's or Lothar's reactions and demise, and Walder Frey's reaction was kind of underwhelming. Even his death seemed quick and ordinary (yet our favorite characters died in horrible or treacherous ways). To top it off, no one witnesses the Starks' revenge. The whole thing could've been off-screen and would have had the same impact imo. 

Believe me, I tried very hard liking that scene, as much as I loved the whole episode. But I can't. This seemed but a poor and quick revenge for one of the most painful and horrifying scene (from a viewers perspective) in the whole show. It might be because I am not a die-hard fan of Arya (I am a fan nonetheless, just not on a Jon Snow level), or because the Red Wedding left a huge emptiness the first time I watched it that's not easy to fill. 

For those of you who loved the scene, can you please change my opinion on it? Why did you love the scene? What made it satisfying? Why do you think this was the right way for the Starks' revenge? 

For those like me, what would you do differently? In my case, I have 3 ideas (and I like the third one most of all): 

• Jaime and his men take out the Freys during the feast in the earlier scene. That would've been a sort-of poetic justice. 

• Arya assassinates Walder during the feast. We viewers could've then witnessed the Freys' and Lannisters' reactions. 

• We don't see it at all. Instead, we hear different stories of what's happening in Riverrun during the KL, Winterfell, and Jaime and Bronn travel scenes (for example, Qyburn mentions there is an assassin wreaking havoc at the Twins, Sansa tells Jon that a raven from Riverrun came saying that Walder died by eating pies made of his sons' remains, and a messenger tells Jaime that Walder was killed, when Jaime asks who killed him, the messenger replies ""no one""). The story is scattered in the episode, and we viewers are left on the edge of our seats until we find out at the last 2 words (no one). 

Leave your comments below, I want to know everyone's opinion on the scene and on my ideas :) ",28,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/55dywo/everything_s6e10_was_this_scene_unsatisfying_for/,2016-10-01 20:39:45
120,5tt9wq,[MAIN SPOILERS] Gendry,"I have a theory on how Gendry's character will play out in the series

-Varys presents Gendry to Dany

-Dany wants Gendry to die as his father did to hers

-Varys explains that Dany WILL HAVE to marry Gendry to gain support from the masses who is now ruled upon maliciously by the Lannisters

-by marrying Gendry to Dany, Dany will have both Baratheon and Targaryen support, a union nobody ever expected

-The Marriage will only be for show and Dany will only be using Gendry for his dick and treats him as a prisoner

-This will prompt Arya to go to King's Landing and save Gendry

-Their son will be the true heir of the ironthrone and Dany will be the queen, unquestioned

INCOMING DND TWIST
-upon getting pregnant, Dany executes Gendry

-Arya will want revenge and will try to kill Dany

-This one will go two ways, and two ways only

-Dany becomes the Mad queen and Jon Snow will have to kill her immolating his sword, revealing he was Azor Ahai all along.

125,bmqdi4,[Spoilers] Am i the only one who enjoyed Episode 4?,"I've just been surprised by how much shit this most recent episode is getting on this sub and all over the internet. It seems to me that a large consensus of people think its the worst episode of the entire show. To me ""The Long Night"" was a hell of a lot worse with way too much plot armour, underwhelming and illogical battle strategy and an unsatisfying conclusion to the white walker story. But I guess people like an action heavy episode as opposed to the character focused and slower one that episode 4 is. Let me just explain why I actually enjoyed the shit out of episode 4 first before you all shit on me lol.

To me this episode felt like old Game of Thrones. Sure the writing isn't as good as the earlier seasons but at least they finally gave Tyrion and Varys politically charged dialogue full of intrigue and interesting development. To me what they did to Dany was incredibly interesting and it makes sense for her to reach a tipping point after all she has lost since she came to Westeros. The people saying that her going ""mad queen"" is out of character doesn't make any sense to me because it is something that people have been talking about for years. How can it be both out of character for her and too predictable at the same time? People were able to predict it because it made sense for her character. I think what they did to Daenerys this episode was incredibly interesting and I can't wait to see how it all gets resolved. The one thing that I agree with is that Euron's attack didn't make sense logistically but i think the logic was much worse in ""The Long Night"" and Season 7's ""Beyond the Wall"" episode. Basically I understand that the writing has gotten worse ever since D&D ran out of book material but to me episode 4 reminded me of the dialogue heavy and politically intriguing scenes we got in earlier seasons. I've re-watched this episode 3 times and have loved it every time. The first half in Winterfell is great, I loved everything with Tyrion and Varys, Sansa becoming like Littlefinger and using information to divide those loyal to Daenerys was incredibly satisfying and the climax with Cersei executing Missandei was very intense.

I'm not angry or anything here and if people hate this episode than fair enough but I'm just curious why this one was the tipping point for most people as opposed to ""The Long Night. I was way more disappointed with that episode but cheered myself up when I realized that the political conflict with Cersei is more interesting to me than the fantasy type one with the army of the dead and I think this episode delivered in terms of building up excitement for the final 2 episodes. I legitimately have no idea how this is all going to end I honestly can't wait for episode 5 so to me this episode did its job well.",115,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bmqdi4/spoilers_am_i_the_only_one_who_enjoyed_episode_4/,2019-05-10 02:37:30

127,bslsau,[SPOILERS] It was not D&D who ruined Game of Thrones,"I know this will get downvoted to oblivion, but it was the fans and media.

Fans have no idea what they want. There was a poll with a sample size of over 100,000 after episode 4 asking: “Yes or no, do they want Dany to burn King’s Landing to the ground even if it meant the death of innocents?”  Over 43,000, 43% of fans wanted it, said yes she should. 

THE NEXT WEEK after episode 5, a poll to the same group of people, with a sample size of over 130,000, asked “has Dany had been provoked enough to justify her actions?” This question followed with the note “this question is NOT about whether the writers did a good or bad job.” And NOW over 113,000, or 83% of voting fans, think her actions were not justified? Basically the same question one week later and there is a 40% swing??

A poll after the Battle of Winterfell, with a sample size over 150,000, asked what of these battle episode had been your favorite? And BoW easily came in 2nd with 32% of the vote after the BotB.

Out of curiosity, I did a poll asking your favorite battles, the Battle of Winterfell now only had 6% of votes? Small sample size with only over 200 votes but suddenly BoW is inferior and one of the most “poorly reviewed” episodes of the show? How is this not an example of our culture’s mob mentality and recency bias?

I get it Battle of Winterfell had plot armor, plot holes, and poor logic. But re watch the Battle of the Bastards, which got nearly “perfect” reviews. There were many examples of plot armor, plot holes, and poor logic. If you looked back a couple years ago, people pointed them out. but they said incredible production made up for it. Now suddenly production cannot make up for these faults?

A lot is the media’s fault. It is now “cool” to hate on thrones. Instead of blindly giving episodes a 10/10 right away on IMDB, thousands of fans, before the episodes even started, blindly gave it a 1/10. Youtube and social media with flooded with content critiquing the plot errors. All of this preconditioned our brains to criticize even more. Where were these countless videos and criticism after the Battle of the Bastards and earlier episodes? 

Do I still think it was rushed and we should have got more episodes? 110%. But D&D had this vision of how they wanted to end the shows years before they took on Star Wars. That unfair Star Warws narrative clouds our perception even more. 

Despite its flaws, I still believe season 8 of Game of Thrones was excellent television. I understand completely when HBO executives and actors said to take fan reaction with a grain of salt. If fans wanted a perfectly logical show then maybe people should have stopped watching a fantasy about dragons and ice zombies years ago.

The time the fans had just made them come up with some crazy fan theories, and in the end every one had a favourite ending to the show. And now, the expected hapenned, D&D doing the unexpected. I for example loved the writing of Danaerys this season, as she now finally is the mad queen, which you could've guessed the whole series long. 

In the end, I think the people are just upset the writers do what literally nobody expected, which doesn't fit with their in their opinion ""perfect ending"". Game of Thrones always found a way to surprise us, so don't be surprised if it does again, and certainly don't be upset. Because in the end, isn't that what we all loved about the series, that nobody could guess what happens next.

135,bplo4g,[Spoilers] Am I Crazy?? My thoughts on Season 8...,"I hope through the old gods and the new I don’t get downvoted to hell for this. So:

TLDR: I’m really enjoying season 8 and personally don’t agree/understand all the hate. 

Please note this is all my opinion and I’m not attacking anyone nor do I mean any disrespect. 

I’m really fucking loving season 8 but every time I go on reddit after an episode to talk about it I’m discouraged because of the overwhelming negativity, and I just don’t get it!! These are my thoughts on the major complaints I’ve seen thus far:

Complaint #1: The writing is shit.

I will concede the writing took a noticeable dip down between seasons 4 and 5 when GRRM left to continue the books. I justified that by reminding myself it’s a little unfair to compare an author’s writing to a showrunners. Imo they are completely different jobs, showrunners, when writing an episode, are considering budgets, deadlines, shooting schedules, etc., and authors just have to worry about the story. Seasons 1-4 was the show adapting to the prewritten content, seasons 5 onward flipped, cause that’s the nature of television. 

That said, I haven’t seen any shift since season 5. The writing in S8 is the same quality as S5, S6, and S7, and there are still some amazingly written episodes in those seasons (5x01 and 6x05 come to mind immediately). So I think it’s a little ridiculous to expect DND to magically become GRRM for the final season. 

Complaint #2: Character Arcs are trash.

Mad Queen was foreshadowed in books and show since the beginning, period. Other people have written far superior pieces as to the details, but I’d bet money GRRM does the same thing in WftD (if it ever comes). 

The other two characters I see shit on a lot this season are Euron and Jamie. Euron isn’t his book self, obviously. As someone who saw the show first and read the books as a buffer during the long night of waiting, when I first met Euron I thought he was hilarious. Upon reading I understand why people feel cheated, he is some special kind of crazy in the books, but as he is on the show, as the funny bad guy you love to hate, I think he fits the role pretty well. As for his screen time in this season (which people say is too much) yeah I’ll concede this character isn’t met for long periods of screen time as his personality shines in small, infrequent doses. Again I’ll say that this is GRRM’s ending and book Euron will probably be in the same position as show Euron, so I chalk it up to DND being faithful to GRRM’s ending. 

Jamie is addicted to Cersei, that is his character arc. It’s an abusive, toxic relationship, and that’s the point of Jamie. We’ve seen him redeem himself only to return to his old ways for Cersei multiple times (helps Tyrion escape.... burns the river lands and manipulates Edmuir). His running back to Cersei, especially after he finds out she’s in danger, makes perfect sense if you look at him as an addict in need of one more fix. When you’re recovering from addiction the risk of relapse is high. AND they died fulfilling the Valenqar prophecy in a unique way that I found to be clever. 

Complaint #3: DND rejected the season extension.

More episodes would’ve been awesome, obviously. As any fan of any show would think, more episodes means more time means more and more is better with this many characters. But DND have given a decent chunk of their lives to this show, I don’t blame for wanting to move and passing up the overtime. If you were offered overtime, at the same pay, at your job would you take it? I wouldn’t. I understand the feeling of being let down, but try to see their perspective, they think 6 is enough to do what they want, and I think they’re doing pretty damn well. 


To end this mini essay, I want to remind people who are angry that you get back what you put in. This show was never perfect, even from the beginning it had flaws, all shows do. I know people have a lot of expectations for this series, some people have been invested for 20+ years now, but when I watch games I’m not looking for the flaws, or obsessing over the lines that don’t quite work. I’m marvelling at the experience the show gives, the visual storytelling that the books will NEVER be able to do because they’re different mediums of art (Arya and the horse, Dany on Drogon as the bells ring, etc.). If you watch Sunday’s episode looking for flaws and expecting trash, that’s exactly what you’ll get, even if it’s objectively fantastic. If you go in taking what you’re given and celebrating the end of this fantastic saga of pain and joy though, I promise you won’t forget it.

If you read all this you’re a champ and again this is my opinion and I mean no disrespect to anyone who’s upset with the season, I just wanted to express my opinions on the matter :)",258,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bplo4g/spoilers_am_i_crazy_my_thoughts_on_season_8/,2019-05-17 06:34:34
136,bp3weu,[Spoilers] Am I the only one happy with this season and hows it playing out?,"I know it hasnt been perfect but I'm really enjoying this season. A lot of the events have been foreshadowed at some point throughout the series so I don't agree with a lot of people saying stuff has been unexpected or out of left field.

137,bj27xb,"[SPOILERS] Stop saying the Night King is a ""one-dimensional villain"" or ""just pure evil"". He's not a villain at all.","A lot of disappointment seems to come from the Night King being ""one-dimensional"". That he didn't have some tragic backstory or complicated interests. However, this carries the faulty assumption that the Night King is a villain to begin with.

He's not a villain at all.

The Night King isn't evil. He's nothing. He represents death, darkness, entropy, the finality of things. As living beings, and people who sympathize with the living beings of the show, its in our nature to see anything that brings death as villainous. Yet that's just the natural state of things. Life likely the exception in this universe, that's why we have yet to observe it anywhere but on this Earth.

Is cancer evil for killing millions of people, including many of our loved ones? Does HIV or Ebola have a compelling backstory? Does Malaria have a hidden motive? No, it's just the tragic way of nature. The battle was never a clash between good and evil. It was a clash between existence and nothingness. Neither are inherently better or worse than the other. Many people on the side of the living have done terrible and unforgivable things themselves.

There doesn't need to be a great mystery. We've known the Night King's purpose since season 6. He was created to erase everything, to wipe the slate clean. That's all he is doing. That's all he needs to do. The drama comes not from our characters fighting a complex villain, it comes from our characters defying what we believed was always inevitable. ""Winter is coming"", ""All men must die"", yet at that moment, they all joined together and said in unison ""not today"".",116,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bj27xb/spoilers_stop_saying_the_night_king_is_a/,2019-04-30 15:33:02

139,blyj6p,"[SPOILERS] You know what, fuck it: A D&D Positivity/Appreciation Thread","Sometimes it's worth remembering:

GRRM wrote the ASOIAF books partially as a way of rebelling against the Hollywood studio system.  After the time he spent in the film industry, he wanted to make a series so expansive and epic that it would literally be unfilmable.

He stuck to his guns for **YEARS**...*until* he met D&D.

Their approach, earnest knowledge, and passion for the series so impressed him that he tested them right there: ""Who is Jon Snow's mother?""  And they knew it right then and there, themselves.  No help from internet theories or giant subreddits.  And thus they made perhaps the most colossal three-point shot in fantasy adaptation history, securing the rights to what would be the most lucrative series of all time.

Obviously, no one is immune from all criticism, but it's time a lot of the discourse surrounding this show steps back and takes a serious reality check:

**D&D are extremely knowledgeable and competent writers.  They have gone the large part of 5 seasons adapting from a very rich blueprint to nearly UNIVERSAL acclaim.  After that, they had no choice but to enter the immensely difficult position of having to deliver a satisfying ENTIRE FINAL ACT, armed with nothing more than merely THE AUTHOR'S BASIC OUTLINE and the rich understanding they've showcased for the source material that brought them this far and captivated said author in the first place.  That's it.**

Obviously, from a fan and reader's perspective, it certainly feels weird to watch a story you've spent so much time with veer further and further into the realm of fan fiction, especially as not-exactly-canon plot points begin to pile higher and higher atop one another toward an ending we aren't even sure was intended by the story's creator.  **But that's literally the only way this could go.**  GoT is an *adaptation*, not the original work.  D&D couldn't wait and wait for not one but two more installments that very well may never come out.  And yet, while half the internet obsessively nitpicks the most hyper-specific details of a fantasy show (*how come Dany didn't see the ships? how come the trebuchets are outside the wall? how come a rock didn't melt? how come the Dothraki didn't charge right? How come Arya is that stealthy? etc etc etc*) we all seem to be taking for granted the fact that **D&D are STILL largely doing right by the arcs of like 90% of the largest cast of characters ever assembled onscreen.  And let's not pretend this still isn't the most spectacular thing occurring on TV right now.**

I don't mean to sound harsh, but I'm seeing way too many petulant, eye-rollingly reductive ""*SHIT WRITING*"" takes from people who have barely written more than a college essay in their lifetimes, yet feel confident unilaterally calling writers' performance objectively shit because of one or two plot details they don't agree with that happen to be stacked upon a card castle of writing decisions that largely *actually worked* and often worked *very well* despite lack of source material.  So you think more characters should have died at the Battle of Winterfell even though the season's not even over?  Cool.  So you don't think Arya should've killed the Night King even though you could say it was definitely set up?  Cool.  So you don't think they should've cut away from Jon telling his sisters the truth about his real identity even though we've heard the revelation several times now?  Again, cool.  Seriously.  Any intelligent fan could make a reasonable case for nearly any gripe, and that *really is* perfectly fine and valid.  But it doesn't mean D&D haven't put the same amount of thought into it if not more, *and* with at least *some* the author's input.  It's not ""SHIT WRITING"", and you could realistically wager that 95% of professional TV writers would likely collapse and/or fail spectacularly under the weight of successfully concluding this story on their own.  It just sometimes doesn't feel good to watch two people that *aren't* GRRM get to lead the charge when things occasionally don't come out the way we pictured, especially as we draw nearer and nearer to the end.

But guess what?  **We're all in uncharted waters together here.  NO ONE'S ending is definitively the perfectly ""right"" choice without GRRM.  George simply left the HBO series out to dry.  That's simply the situation we're left with.  But we have, by all counts at least, the next best thing.  And yet again, it is still undeniably the best thing on TV.**

142,bnxnu5,[Spoilers] This show cannot he defended anymore,"I ask that you please listen to what I have to say before down-pouring me in downvotes, and know that you are entirely entitled to your own opinion, as am I. Also, know that I love this show, and that every single person who has criticized this season loves this show. With that said, after episode 5, I really just can’t defend it. 

1. The Iron Fleet lands every shot on Rhaegal, yet when Dany comes in with Drogon, they fire ONE arrow and it MISSES. She was wide open, same situation as last time, but they fire once and miss. How does this make any logical sense. 

2. 8 seasons of character development and story building of Dany for this? Seriously? She knows people fear her, she knows what she is doing, and yet she still does it. Today she broke every moral rule she ever set in place. They rang the bells. She had the city. Now, there is no iron throne to sit on because she fucking burned everything to the ground. She probably killed half the city. I don’t know about you, but I didn’t watch 8 seasons of this show for one of my favorite characters to completely change last second.

3. Jamie and Cersei- what the fuck was that. First of all, what was the point with his and Brienne’s story if he was just going to go back to her. Secondly, first we get a shitty death for our Night King, and then this happens to Cersei. Both major villains throughout the ENTIRE series are just wooshed away like that, just for our beloved Dany to become the villain. Ok, sure. 

I have other minor criticisms, but they don’t matter much. I will say there were good aspects to the episode, such as the Hound vs. Mountain. I’m satisfied with that, although I feel like it would’ve been much cooler if Arya popped out of no where to kill the Mountain instead of her killing the Night King. Would have been way more meaningful considering that had more to do with her story, but I won’t get into the Battle of Winterfell again. I don’t know how they are going to fix this with literally one episode left, I really don’t. And the fact that D&D was given the opportunity for 10 episodes and said “nah, that’s ok” upsets me quite a bit. Anyways, maybe I’ll edit this later to get my point across better with a clear head cause tbh I’m a little upset right now. And again, totally entitled to your opinion, and so am I, so if I get comments like “Don’t watch the show then!” or “You’re just nitpicking”, just know you will be ignored.

146,yuzed,"My Jon Snow theory, spoilers for probably every book.","I have been mulling this theory over and over in my head since I finished ADWD. I think Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaeryen, and Lyana Stark. Let me explain how I have come to this conclusion.


Let's go back to before the war against the Mad King Aerys. I forget which tournament it was specifically, but when Rhaegar won, he gave the 'beauty' prize (?) to Lyana, instead of his wife to everyones surprise. This to me lays some ground work that at least Rhaegar had feelings for Lyana. 


Now, I forget if Robert was specifically betrothed to Lyana, or if that was going to be the plan, or whatever. In the first book Robert speaks very harshly of Rhaegar, and says he kidnapped Lyana. I feel this is false. I forget which book specifically, but people who knew Rhaegar well, described him as a very compassionate, gentle person. Rhaegar was also well loved by the smallfolk, and from what I gather, was a genuinely good person.


I believe that Lyana willingly ran away with Rhaegar. I remember Ned mentioning or maybe he had a memory of Lyana saying that Robert would never be faithful to her. They never explain the exact circumstances around her disappearance, unless I missed something.


Now, we know Lyana's disappearance/kidnapping was at the very least a catalyst that started the war against the Mad King. Lets think about the time it could take, for Ned and Robert's armies to not only fight their way to King's Landing, but to Lyana. A war in this type of setting could easily turn into 9-12 month process, and longer with sieges. 


In the first book AGOT, Ned has a flashback to the encounter with the Kingsguard of the time at the (I forget the name) tower. The flashback doesn't explain a lot of things, and at the end of it, it describes Ned holding Lyana as she lies dieing in a pool of blood, making an as yet still unknown promise to her. 


Now, the Mad King's Kingsguard have all been described as some of the most honorable/skilled men of their time. And we already know that Rhaegar has feelings for Lyana from his actions after winning the tournament, so why would he attempt to kill her? And obviously he had also died fighting Robert at the Triedent prior to Ned's encounter with the Kingsguard. On that note as well, why would he order his kingsguard to kill her? And would they have actually followed that order if he had given it?


Now, with all that explained, I believe that Lyana died giving birth to Rhaegar's son, while making Ned promise to keep the secret of his lineage from Robert especially due to a distinct challenge to his claim of the throne. We know he wanted to have Danaerys killed during AGOT for the same thing.

149,bjfrod,[SPOILERS] I’m sick and tired of this,"People can’t seem to stop critiquing Ep. 3 - for reasons I personally can’t understand.

Now I have to point out that English is not my first language but I’ll try to be as concise as possible.

Game of Thrones is a fantasy based TV show which started as an interpretation following GRRM’s books, and I dear say interpretation since there are a number of differences between the books and the movie itself, and has become D&D’s take on how the show should continue, and not the writer’s original imagination. So if anyone is to be “critiqued” for their lack of originality, it’s D&D. However, this can be said about any work ever made - many people argue that Star Wars was crap because they felt Anakin becoming Darth Vader was too dramatic, which is utter rubbish.

What I know for a fact is that, for me, out of all the episodes of GoT, Ep. 3 made hold my breath for an hour, gasping and how wonderful the cinematography was, feeling the dread and terror when someone as fearless as Grey Worm was shitting his pants seeing the tsunami of undead attacking them, almost having a heart attack while Arya was hiding in the library, felt goosebumps watching Beric sacrificing himself in the way that he did and many - many more.

The climax of the show, which was such an amazing rollercoaster of emotions, was the shock of almost getting ready to see Bran die or something, all of that to be stopped by Arya, performing the most amazing sacrificial dive.

Do I want to know the physics of how she managed to pull it off? No.

Do I judge their strategic mistakes on sending a Dothraki horde to attack the undead blindly? No. Was I there to make the call? No. GoT throughout the 8 seasons made us understand that even the most cunning characters can and do make mistakes.

So please, everyone, calm your tits and watch the damned show or stop with all this nonsense.",62,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bjfrod/spoilers_im_sick_and_tired_of_this/,2019-05-01 15:00:08

151,bk7w7p,[Spoilers] Game of Thrones is no longer Game of Thrones,"George RR Martin said with Game of Thrones he wanted to get away from the predictable good vs evil narrative, break the mould, he wanted to ensure that characters shouldn't survive where they dont look like they ought to survive. That the story shouldnt follow a traditional narrative. Nothing is black and white, everything is grey. Thats what makes the characters so interesting. And they were.

Game of Thrones now is the complete opposite, its set itself into that traditional mould, its contrived, panders to the audience, is creating ""favourite"" invincible characters with plot armour. Has Mary Sue characters, has Deus Ex Machina moments.

It become the polar opposite of what make Game of Throne great. It's as though David and Dan dont understand the essence of why people loved GOT, at least the George RR Martin version. 

The greatest moments of the show have been when Ned Stark, Rob Stark, Catelyn Stark, Tywin Lannister, Jofrey, all get killed. It pulls the rug from right underneath your feet, leaves you in a daze and you dont understand whats going to happen next.

All that unpredictability disappeared after Tywin died. After deviating from the books they are too afraid to kill off anyone significant anymore because theyre pandering to the audience. Now any main character in danger simply meets a predictable bait and switch tactic protected by plot armour. Its become like any other TV series.

The characters have lost all depth. Look at the hound, hes gone from a beloved complex character at the beginning, to just a flat, almost comedy act now. The characters have all become completely 1 dimensional and dull. 

It gone from a show for adults about politics, corruption and power, to now a fantasy show for teenagers.",36,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bk7w7p/spoilers_game_of_thrones_is_no_longer_game_of/,2019-05-03 16:26:58
152,4sg8xx,"[MAIN SPOILERS] Azor Ahai is... (oh no, not one of these again!)","**Jaime Lannister is Azor Ahai**

&nbsp;

**DISCLAIMER:** Most who do not agree with this theory and find it absurd will not bother reading till the end of the passage. So for them, this is just a theory. We'll know if I'm right or wrong eventually :)

&nbsp;

Now I have read several of the other theories but either they are from people who do not fully understand the legend or are simply not aware of a few things due to not having read the books or the text of these theories is not formed correctly. Plus I am kinda sick of people telling me that Jon Snow/Daenerys Targaryen are Azor Ahai.

So here goes. Below is a copy paste from the wiki cause I can't find the original source for now:

>1. Azor Ahai needed to forge a hero's sword. He labored for thirty days and thirty nights until it was done. However, when he went to temper it in water, the sword broke. He was not one to give up easily, so he started over.

>2. The second time he took fifty days and fifty nights to make the sword, even better than the first. To temper it this time, he captured a lion and drove the sword into its heart, but once more the steel shattered.

>3. The third time, with a heavy heart, for he knew beforehand what he must do to finish the blade, he worked for a hundred days and nights until it was finished. This time, he called for his wife, Nissa Nissa, and asked her to bare her breast. He drove his sword into her living heart, her soul combining with the steel of the sword, creating Lightbringer. 

&nbsp;

Relation to Jaime:

1. The first is Jaime losing his hand, his sword

2. The second is Jaime indirectly being responsible for the death of Tywin Lannister - the lion

3. The third and yet to occur is Jaime killing Cersei

&nbsp;

**Now questions arise**

&nbsp;

**Q: Doesn't Azor Ahai have the blood of the dragon? Jaime is Tywin Lannister's son right?**

A: Not true. Read the books. It is pretty much (all but) confirmed by now that Jaime and Cersei are Aerys II Targaryen's (The Mad King) offspring. On Tywin Lannister's wedding night, The Mad King was drunk and joked to Tywin that it was a great pity that the lord's right to the first night had been abolished. This is told to Jaime by his aunt in the fifth book and before that somewhere else as well.

She also mentions how Tywin was not one to let these things go and was too prideful (or some such - this theory isn't widely known and as a result I don't have the source material right now). So Tywin allowed Aerys to bed Joanna Lannister.

&nbsp;

**Q: Wait, why would Jaime kill Cersei??! Doesn't he love her?**

A: Yes he does. And time and again he is drawn to Cersei because of her motherly instincts. That is what humanizes her in Jaimes' eyes. In the show, with all her children dead (and possibly in the books too soon enough) the one thing that Jaime held on to in order to justify her actions is gone. Something will happen that will draw a wedge between them and hence force Jaime to kill her.

&nbsp;

**Q: But Cersei's little brother is supposed to kill her according to the fortune teller!**

A: Jaime is the ONLY little brother Cersei has! By DNA and genetics and all. Tyrion is Tywin's actual son which also explains why Tywin resented Tyrion so much. Somewhere deep down inside he knew his true offspring was a dwarf. So no Tyrion does not kill Cersei.

**EDIT**: Quote from Genna Lannister, Jaime's aunt:

>Jaime, sweetling, I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna's breast. You smile like Gerion and fight like Tyg and there's some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak...but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you. I said so once to your father's face, and he would not speak to me for half a year.

&nbsp;

**Q: This is confusing and you are stupid! Azor Ahai has to be reborn amidst smoke and salt for fuck's sake!**

A: Now a I have read about Jaime being reborn in the bath house with Brienne of Tarth. Confessing his guilt that has been eating him up inside. This happens in the third book where we get to see Jaime's view on the world for the first time. Before this he is portrayed as a narcissistic dick.

I really don't have a personal opinion on the salt and smoke thing other than the fact that the Legend of Azor Ahai is just that - a legend meant to sound poetic and glorious.

**EDIT**: And as pointed out it can mean a rebirth amidst the salt and smoke in the bath house.

&nbsp;

**Q: You sir are a dick and soo totally wrong! How can soo many other people/theories about Jon/Daenerys be wrong??! I love Jon/Daenery and want him/her to be Azor Ahai**

A: George RR Martin has a knack for leading people in the wrong direction. If you have read any of the books then you will know this to be true. It's a writers trick or something. Lead the audience to where they want to go and what they want should happen. And he is very good at it. The most obvious thing will NEVER happen in his books as far as theories are concerned.

&nbsp;

**Q: But how can a one armed man who lost his sword arm be the Chamion of Light?!**

A: That is what the books are about. People you would never expect to be amazing turning out as amazing.

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

I feel Oathkeeper will somehow find it's way back to Jaime. And hence him at least wielding a sword. He need not physically kill White Walkers as we are pretty much aware by now that he simply can't fight as well anymore. But he has shown skill at being a commander and tactician (I hope!). And that could simply be the role delegated to him.

**EDIT**: I also read about the Targaryen madness being clearly visible in Cersei and Joffrey so thought I'd mention that as well.

&nbsp;

**Note to George RR Martin**

Mr. Martin sir I am sorry if I spoiled the story. Your books are the best literature this century or any century for that matter. Keep up the good work. Also when is the sixth book coming out?

156,6v0ult,[EVERYTHING] Writing going down hill,"After watching tonight's episode, I realized that Game of Thrones has really gone down hill this last season. 

This whole season has been really devoid of any coherent writing.

First you have Daenerys refusing to just conquer King's landing in episode one of the season, despite her ability to do so. 

It would have been so much better from a story line perspective to just have that part out of the way, and then move on to the zombie war in the north.

It only really makes sense as a writer if you're going out of your way to keep certain redundant characters in the show.(*cough* Jaime and Cersei)

Then you have these main characters going on a wilderness hike through Antarctica or somewhere north of the wall to go catch a zombie in order to impress upon Queen Scorched-Earth in King's Landing that there are real zombies. Because she's trust worthy, right?

Then you have an opportunity at the end of episode 6 to just burn ALL of the zombies, or even easier, just burn the white walkers on their horses, thereby killing all of the zombies. It would seriously take them 10 minutes tops, *roll credits* at the pace they were going, even with Napoleon Dynamite's Uncle Rico throwing ice lances a quarter mile. 

I mean, the writers here are obviously out of ideas. It's clear that they are just generating filler episodes to maneuver the show into a pre-ordained series finale.

Why did Sansa just so happen to be in Arya's room and go straight for underneath her bed and pick up a harmless looking satchel?

Jon and the gang needed 1 wight to show Cersei. How come when he killed the WW, the wights that were being controlled died with it but there was ONE wight that just so happened to be controlled by another WW?

160,u7k8y,How to explain ASOIAF to an 8 year old.,"Yesterday, I broke my fast in a restaurant while reading ASoS and was approached by a dad who was telling his young son, ""Wow, look how big that book is."" To me he said, ""I'm trying to get him excited about reading. What's it about?"" The way he asked, I knew he wanted me to tell the kid. So after a moment's hesitation I said, ""It's a fantasy about medieval politics, war, murder, sex, magic, dragons, family and deception. But mostly it's about how the world is never how you want it to be, no matter how hard you try."" I don't think the dad was very happy with me, but I am of the opinion that if you don't want to know, then don't ask.

164,4ntnp5,[Everything]I don't get why everyone is complaining about tonight's episode,"I honestly thought tonight's episode was great, but everyone else on this sub seems to think it was horrble. I just don't understand why. It may have disproven cleganebowl during the trial by combat, but that was unlikely to happen anyway, seeing The Hound is half the continent away from KL. It will probably still happen, just in a different manner. Also, saying there will be no trial by combat basically proves there will be violence during the trial. Another thing people have been complaining about is the Arya stuff. We would not have seen the fight scene anyway, seeing it was in the dark, and most of the theories about her setting The Waif up or Jaquen being disguised as her were unlikely anyway. It is obvious that a lot of time had passed throughout episode 7, so Arya clearly just got a false sense of security and made a genuine mistake, it is not bad writing whatsoever, and is a lot more plausible than Jaquen risking his life to give Arya a 3rd chance, which he specifically said he wouldn't do. The only thing that had me salty during this episode was the offscreen death of The Blackfish, as that was unnecessary. Downvote away, but I am just putting my opinion out there.

Edit: Wow, this has become extremely controversial. Also, a lot of people have asked how it is obvious that a lot of time has passed throughout Arya's storyline. Well, in episode 7, we see Theon and Yara in Volantis (presumably after Arya's scene in episode 6), while in Arya's scene, the sailors are saying that the ironborn arrived at Slaver's Bay. It would take more than a single day to get from Volantis to Slaver's Bay, indicating that a decent amount of time had passed.

Edit 2: Another thing people are pointing out is the fact that Arya was able to sleep off multiple gut wounds. I assumed that at least 2 or 3 days had passed between Arya scenes (just guessing this, it may acually be plot armour), which would be enough time for her wounds to close but not fully heal, based on the medical treatment she was under. This explains why she started bleeding again after running for a bit, as her wounds would have re-opened.

170,7i286t,[MAIN SPOILERS]I just binged on all 7 seasons. My complaint with Season 7.,"Let me start off by saying that pacing is an issue on this show.  It's agonizingly slow at times, but Season 6 and particularly 7 accelerated that pace to the point that its created some missteps.  My biggest complaint is after 6 Seasons of watching Daenerys Targaryen build her army,  Season 7 should have been her time to shine.   My biggest complaint is that her storyline converged with Jon Snows and they forced a romance between the two.   She should have taken the Iron Throne from Cercei *AND THEN* united with Jon Snow and fought off the army of the dead in Season 8 with him.   The romance is fan servicey but doesn't work.  Jon's characterization is not a guy who knocks on the door wanting sex, and she is not the type to fall in love.   The end game should have been the two of them *finally* crossing paths and becoming good friends/allies, but they put all of their eggs into one basket with Season 7 and are rushing to the finish line now.

171,6toqkg,[MAIN SPOILERS] There is some serious pandering to the fans going on,"I can't be the only one noticing and getting aggravated by it.

Gendry's return is pandering, they even included a lame rowing joke. I honestly can't believe people liked that part.

Oh suddenly everyone's dream team is together to catch a white walker!

I am saying it now, if Cleganebowl happens I am going to outright say that the show is bad now. Fan pandering is cover up for shit writing.

174,bklfwh,"[Spoilers] No, Arya has not been training for all seven seasons","Might be a long-ish post

The show starts with Arya being good at archery which makes sense. Then she goes off to King's Landing and reaches there midway through the season where she begins her water dancing lessons. Her lessons last a little more than two months after which Syrio dies.

Then she runs off and joins the caravan going to the Wall. Before they get anywhere close, the get ambushed by the Gold cloaks where she loses her sword to Polliver (Pulliver?). So now she has no sword to practice with.

They are taken to Harrenhall where she becomes Tywin's cupbearer. Great position to learn general wisdom but she still doesn't have her sword.

After escaping Harrenhall, they are taken by The Brotherhood without Banners where she gets to hone her archery skills. But still no sword.

Then she gets kidnapped by the Hound, and then finally, after long last, she gets her sword back. She can resume her water dancing thing she learned for two months (definitely not a lot of time, for the uninitiated). Unfortunately she has no one to spar with as her instructor died a long time back. Sparring is very important as one can't become a master swordsman in their own. But she does spend a considerable amount of time with Hound as they go to Vale, and then to the Twins.

As the Hound supposedly dies, Arya sails to Braavos. Upon reaching, she immediately has to get rid of her sword because a girl must be no one and hence, get rid of all the Arya Stark things. In the House of Black and White, she spends her time washing dead bodies and getting beat by the Waif. She gets one mission to kill the thin merchant, which she fails. She then steals a face (which is a massive plothole as it is never explained how she learned to do that as neither Jaqen nor the Waif ever taught her that). She kills Meryn Trant which I'll admit was cool but as a result she loses her eyes.

She then trains with a staff (which is very different from a sword) and regularly gets bet up by the Waif. Upon getting her eyes back, she is given another mission to kill the actress, which she also fails. Then she bullshits her way through Braavos (surviving three stabs and a dive in the dirty shit water is what I'm talking about) and sails back to Westeros.

Upon reaching Westeros, we learn that she is somehow a master swordsman as good as Brienne magically. Also she can flawlessly swap faces, change her stature and voice when THE FACELESS MEN NEVER TAUGHT HER THAT.

I could go on but I think this much is enough. Arya has NOT been training her entire life or even through the entire seven seasons. :)",135,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bklfwh/spoilers_no_arya_has_not_been_training_for_all/,2019-05-04 18:02:45

I hate to say it, but he really brought his fate upon himself.

185,bdb0a8,[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones is simplified for the lowest common denominator of people,"Before I start, I want to mention that this show has always had and will continue to have amazing aspects.  The amazing acting, detailed and extremely convincing CGI, realistic and well-done sound design, intricate and amazing set design, unique and interesting costumes, cinematography, and beautiful music.  Game Of Thrones has always had these attributes and will continue to have them until the show ends.  

&#x200B;

Although these qualities are present throughout the show, the writing--the very foundation of what makes a story and characters--seem to have been lacking for the past several seasons (S5 to Now), especially compared to the superb writing the others seasons have had.  It seems to be a bit of a coincidence that the seasons that have been lacking in this quality of writing didn't have the books written by George RR Martin as a base for the story.  Now, the writers have gone completely off the rails, at it seems GRRM hasn't had a lot of input as to where the story is going.  So, what are these issues?

&#x200B;

Well first, the entire idea that GRRM had for GOT was that it wasn't just a fantasy with a distinct evil side and good side.  LOTR (as much as I love Tolkien and Middle Earth) is a good vs evil plot with Sauron and the orcs as the evil side and the free peoples of Middle Earth as the good side.  GRRM says that in real life no one is distinctly good or bad.  We may do a bad thing on Wednesday or a good thing on Friday, we're all morally grey and complex.  He did his best to include this in GOT.  This is very prominent throughout the show for the first 4 seasons.  In GOT there used to be no clear good or bad side.  Who were you really hoping to win in the battle of the black water?  It wasn't so black and white, or clear cut.  In s1-4 is Tyrion really a good guy or a bad guy?  Because throughout the show he does both good and bad things.  

&#x200B;

What about GOT now?  Is there really any of that?  It seems that there are very clear good guys and bad guys.  Danny and Jon fighting against the Night King.  And there doesn't seem to be any tension either because we know they are going to defeat them, just like in Return Of The King.  

&#x200B;

 Jon the invincible hero with plot armor and can survive anything without reputations.  When the writers -- I mean Tyrion -- has an idea to go North of the wall in S7 on that horrible mission to get a walker, they are surrounded by an army of the dead and Jon falls into the ice water.  The consequences those guys have for going North of the wall is measured next to nothing.  A dragon dies, but the actual main characters of the show are perfectly fine.  Remember in S1 when there were consequences for characters?  When Ned Stark went to Kings Landing, he made mistake after mistake and by the end of it, he was executed.  When Rob Stark lost part of his army for executing Lord Karstark and marrying that girl instead of one of Walder Frey's daughters, he got consequences.  That provided the story with tension.  During a battle, it actually felt as if there were stakes since literally anyone could die.  Now it just seems to be the classic good vs evil plot where the main characters are invincible and there is no tension whether the good people will win.  

&#x200B;

Watching the first episode of S8 I noticed the new animation for the intro (as beautiful and technically spectacular as it was) only focused only on a couple of the locations.  The wall, kings landing, and Winterfell.   It seems the show has been so simplified to make it easier for the people who watch this show for its pure shock value like the nudity and dragons, rather than what actually made the show good and unique.  Now they won't have to listen to long drawn out boring monologues or any actual character development.  Now they can just watch the sex scenes and actions scenes, not having to keep track of all these plot lines happening over all these different places with different characters and names to remember.  And nothing has made this feeling come in so prominent than watching that new intro for season 8.  What made GOT special was that it defied fantasy cliches.  Imagine at the end of The Return Of the King and after Aragorn became king a new movie came out that talked about what Aragorn did as King.  What does he do about the peasants/poor people, what is his tax policy, what will he do to people if they commit a crime, what does he define as a crime?  That is was GOT is.  And it's shame that a once amazing show like GOT has now been simplified to the humans vs zombies generic plot to pander to the lowest common denominator of people.",80,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bdb0a8/spoilers_game_of_thrones_is_simplified_for_the/,2019-04-15 06:40:35

It's not like the dragons have a personality that make them likeable characters. Because they're dragons and their only purpose is to breathe fire at people.

So why are people rooting for the dragons and why were they upset that Drogon was wounded in the last episode? Is it because they're fans of Daenerys and since she calls the dragons her 'children' so fans are like 'hey, if a dragon died I'd be upset but only because Daenerys would be upset'?

But there's more to the scene. Theon's plot is a story of survival, fortitude and identity. He was violently mutilated, tortured for years and completely dehumanised as Reek, all as a result of his internal conflict with his identity as a Greyjoy raised by Starks. He suffered a lot but more importantly, he survived it all. He built up the courage to escape even though it seemed like he never would. Just like the fight scene, he was beaten to ground over and over but he came back up. I want to believe that being kicked in the groin was a reminder to himself that he has overcome MUCH worse. His identity crisis ended with Jon Snow forgiving him and telling him that he is both a Greyjoy *and* a Stark which gave him the strength he needed to try and save Yara.

The final few seconds of the scene of him washing his face in the sea seemed important for him in a few different ways. It symbolised him affirming his Ironborn culture, the death of cowardly Reek and the rebirth of Theon Greyjoy (what is dead may never die). I think the scene is really important for him because after all the horror he experienced, he learned from it, he learned that he's actually a very resilient person.

Having said all that, the Ironborn changing sides so easily just doesn't make sense to me. So, they follow Yara who has agreed to stop pillaging and raping, she gets captured, they decide to go East instead to ... pillage and rape, their leader gets punched so they agree to save her.

204,5zvg65,[Main Spoilers] Danaerys is the most useless long-surviving character in the show,"I've only finished first 5 seasons, so please don't respond with spoilers

She literally has no personally attributable skill that can be considered admirable - she sucks at combat (don't remember ever seeing her even fighting) and is even worse at ruling cities (she literally destabilized every city she stepped into). And why the hell is she seeing every subject's grievances one-by-one? At least form some crude court system to help you take care of majority of those so she can focus on more important things that a multi-regional ruler would have. She even sucks at raising the one thing most unique to her: her dragons. She puts two of her dragons perpetually in a dark cave; seriously wtf! That's worse than the ""dragons are not slaves"" BS she burned the previous Unsullied owner with! If the dragons are getting out of hand, at least try training them; locking up in a dungeon only weakens them and makes them distrust her more. And to top it off, she has such an immature understanding of justice - *some* slavers put *some* slave children on crosses, so execute *all* slavers and put them on crosses. Anyone with some common sense would at least consider giving the slavers a choice. And her whole thing about abolishing slavery *at once* makes little sense as well; the cities at Slaver's Bay are built by centuries of a slave system. Breaking such a system overnight and with nothing appropriate to replace it is obviously never going to end well. She's easily one of the dumbest of the rulers in GoT. The only interesting thing about her is her ability to resist fire.

And the only reason she has so much power is due to the things *given* to her somehow: the dragons, the Unsullied, and for advisors probably some of the best people in all of GoT world (formerly Jorah, Barristan, Grey Worm, and Daario). Apart from the fire resistance, she has no personal quality deserving of her power or of the awesome things above.",46,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/5zvg65/main_spoilers_danaerys_is_the_most_useless/,2017-03-17 07:53:03

208,4ntoak,[Everything] Was S6E8 the most preposterous episode of the series?,"Nothing about this episode seemed believable.      

1. The waif. Faceless men are supposed to be foolproof assassins. The waif probably fucked up about five different times dating back to last episode. Sure, you can say all her mistakes came down to making the kill a little too personal, but then why wouldn't she just use poison to draw out the death? Or at least use her brain for one second to make sure there wasn't an escape path on the initial sequence? I simply cannot believe that an organization as reputable and deadly as the Faceless Men would train someone so incompetent.     

2. Arya's injuries. Honestly. She's got like ten different stab wounds that haven't even begun to heal. She fell down two fifteen foot drops, including one where she rolled down about fifteen dozen steps, after which, funnily enough, none of the traders seemed to give a shit that she had just knocked over their livelihoods. And after all that, she just runs it off and kills the waif. Alright.     

3. Daenarys just flew in on a gigantic dragon and no one in the pyramid had any idea. So apparently Grey Worm, esteemed military commander of who knows how many campaigns, doesn't post anyone to watch what's going on outside the pyramid when they're trying to guard the inside. Not to mention  the fact that an entire fleet just descended on Meereen without anyone noticing.     

Overall, I just feel like the show is becoming more and more dumbed down. It feels like D & D just expect us to swallow whatever as long as the ending aligns with what we want (aka as long as there's hype it's good). It seems to be a theme for the season, and I sincerely hope that that they write more realistic arcs for next season.

213,bja8kj,[SPOILERS] News Flash: The Battle of Winterfell was SUPPOSED to be dark.,"Im so tired of hearing people complain and whine about how dark the episode was. Calling out the creators, directors etc. for not knowing how to light things, making jokes about how the lighting crew was the dragons and Melisandre alone. Take 5 minutes to learn basic cinematography.


The episode was Supposed to be dark. The same way Jason Bourne or James Bond gets into a fist-fight and theres 47 jump-cut camera angles. The same way a movie about a storm would never have a level-angle shot. The exact same way the Fast & Furious cameras are always panning really fast.

Its immersive. The story being told is of fear of the NIGHT king, and nighttime is...DARK. If you were in the battle if winterfell you also wouldn’t be able to see anything except for the  silhouette of fires randomly scattered. If the scene was lit up like an NFL stadium it would be ridiculous and weird.

The lighting in this episode was a magnificent piece if cinematography and Game of Thrones as a whole is a better, more immersive, interesting and compelling story because of it. Im a Media Production major and i wrote a 5-page paper on the different types of shot angles, lighting, mis-en-place (realism of the setting) and their effect on film with a 20-minute clip of one episode of this show. 

TL;DR
People don’t know how lighting works in cinematography and are bashing the creators who actually did an amazing job",38,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bja8kj/spoilers_news_flash_the_battle_of_winterfell_was/,2019-05-01 03:23:42

220,bzstyf,[NO SPOILERS] You know what really grinds my gears?,"Ok, here goes...

I find it in every field of human experience but its latest form was the whole GOT S8 reception by the audience.

I, for one, loved the season and the ending. Not saying it’s flawless (it isn’t), not saying it’s not rushed (it is, to a degree), and I totally respect any kind of contrary opinion about it.

What really bothers me is the whole narrative of “I have to convince people it’s shit, they must see the truth!”

It’s not science, it’s not something you measure with numbers... it’s love-it vs. hate-it, including all the grey areas in between. It’s entertainment, it’s art. People are entitled to have different opinions about it. Only because it’s not experimental jazz it doesn’t mean it’s bad (also the other way around).

Yet all I see in this sub and on social media in general, are sarcastic, passive/aggressive posts about how much it sucked. It’s like everyone pulling other people’s sleeves to try and convince them that it’s wrong they liked it.

Why tho?

From a sheer opinion standpoint no one should force their view to other people.  
And this should work both ways (of course).

But... (be careful now, it’s gonna sound very hippy)

Why try to convince other people into something “negative”? If there has to be a common ground, why not make it a positive one?

Let’s have a positive stance and maybe let’s try to understand why it was done that way instead of seething with rage with why it wasn’t done the other way!

I just don’t get why people do that. Does it feel good? Please explain! I want to understand why it’s done this way, I don’t want to complain why it’s not done the other way.

TL;DR Enjoy things ffs and let other people do that as well, or explain why don’t you. Cheers!",21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bzstyf/no_spoilers_you_know_what_really_grinds_my_gears/,2019-06-12 19:48:28

But people are getting mad that... Daenerys didnt die..? Lady Mormont killing a giant, Arya killing the Night King, a wight punching through a wall but not a crate.

&#x200B;

I mean people are just digging way too deep now, criticize the show yeah but some people are legitimately taking it to a red wedding type of hatred.

&#x200B;

People need to stop letting it get to their heads so deeply. The show is amazing and if it wasen't then you would not be watching it. GRRM is not a failure, the show is not a failure, the show spoiled us with so many unique scenes like the red wedding that all we expect is good people dying and extremely crazy shit. And when we dont get that, we whine and complain.

&#x200B;

Personally? I have my own ''wtf'' moments such as what was bran doing, brianne getting toppled by like 5 wights and not dying. But that shit doesn't make me hate the episode or the show.

Lady Mormont killing the giant was fucking sick

The Dothraki ( whom aren't good at defending only attacking especially with horses ) getting wiped out was fucking sick

The dragon fight was fucking sick

Arya coming in was fucking sick

The music was fucking sick

Theon fighting and dying was fucking sick

Season 5-7, Littlefinger's storyline is utterly exterminated, his intelligence is reduced to zero, does stupid shit like marrying Sansa to Ramsay and staying in Winterfell to get killed, reaction:""Oh Sansa & Co. were so smart he couldn't have seen it coming, what a great end to this villain!""

Season 8:Daenerys, a complete whacko who has been screaming about birthright, burning down cities and armies since Season 2, massacred numerous innocent civilians in Mereen, is completely okay with collective punishments, preaches the end of slavery but forces people to serve her or face death and laughs at terrified peasants fleeing from her flying monsters finally snaps after losing all she had lived for:her few friends, and her right to the throne, and there aren't any wise(Jorah, Barristan, Varys) advisors to keep her back and fix her mistakes like they've always done in the past and decides to destroy a city to instill fear into the Seven Kingdoms in order to consolidate her rule as a tyrant, reaction:""OMG DAENERYS WAS PURE GOOD ALL ALONG HOW COULD YOU DO THIS D&D ARE LITERALLY THE DEVIL""

Like, seriously? Daenerys' arc is one of the few things that actually made sense amidst a couple of horrid seasons, but now that your ""hero"" you've been blindly following through murder and slaughter commits what she's always done on a larger scale, it's suddenly out of character?

Well, I wish he had run away. Here's why, Jon has to decide where his loyalties lie to, the Watch or family. Him choosing family would add so much depth into his character. Jon had grown up with Robb his entire life, and throwing that away because of some stupid oath that most members don't even take seriously is just foolish. Jon obviously looks up to Ned, so just like his father, loyalty is a trait he follows. But loyalty towards family should always come first, he might be a bastard, but Robb was more of a brother to him than Sam or Grenn would ever be. So I think he should've continued going to Robb.

247,8jm33m,[SPOILERS] Can we have an open an honest discussion about this Dany scene from the show?,"[This is the photo in question] (https://imgur.com/a/nP6ZgEJ) (Dany being surrounded and lifted up by the freed slaves of Yunkai)

Every once in a while, I see a post about this scene being problematic because it depicts all these brown people holding up a single white person as if she were a higher being.  They argue (understandably) that it's making a very racist statement.

While the imagery here definitely has problematic racial overtones, I would argue that what lead up to this image was casting decisions that were probably made with the intent of placating the same groups who have complained about it.

In the books, it's made very clear that slavery on Planetos is unlike the Euro-American slave trade in that *any* wayward ship or unprotected waterside town can fall victim to slaver ships. Sure a good portion of the slaves are made up of people from central & eastern Essos who fell victim to the Dothraki, but there would also be many unfortunate drifters, foreign criminals and LOTS of wildlings from hovels on the northeastern Westerosi shores (such as Hardhome) 

On GoT, it seems to me as if the show runners decided that viewers would be offended by, or otherwise, couldn't accept there being slaves of all different skin tones.  I would bet a million dollars that if they had cast the slaves differently, there would have been at least a few articles on sites like Salon.com and The Guardian complaining that the show was attempting to minimize the atrocity of the Euro-American slave trade & it's racial connection by trying to ""de-racialize"" slavery on the show.  I can definitely see them attempting to avoid bad publicity.

248,4u91k0,[NO SPOILERS] Am I the only one who thinks that the TV's depiction of the Moon Door is stupid?,"In the books, it was an actual door parallel to walls, not a hole in the floor. For the TV's version of Moon Door to work, the Eyrie would have to be built on an extremely thin cliff edge (I estimate 3 meters deep). Subsequently, whoever was building the castle would also have to drill a hole through the ground underneath the castle. None of these make the Eyrie a very stable mountaintop structure.

250,1vroz0,[No Spoilers] The Top 3 Geophysical Abnormalities With The Game Of Thrones World Map,"1. It’s too linear. Westeros is starkly based on a north/south axis and Essos is stunningly east/west. Continents are more globular.  

2. Where are the forests? If this world is like Earth, forests should be a far larger part of the ecosystem. Same can be said for deserts and to a degree mountains. There is a bewildering uniformity of landform here (grassland dominant).  

3. If it’s cold enough to not melt the Wall (which is made of ice), how can there be trees north of there? The northern-most tree-line should be well south of the Wall.

251,bu8phl,[Spoilers] Sansa is the power hungry one.,"Many Daenerys critics claim that since season 1 Daenerys showed signs of being a power hungry bitch. I disagree considering all she wanted was to go back home to the house with the red door and not be raped and sold to a man she didn't know who didn't even speak the same language. (Though she did do an okay job of taking those lemons and making some sweet lemonade from some rather shitty circumstances. 

But then you have Sansa Stark. A character who from the very first episode wanted nothing more than to marry Joffrey so that she could be queen. 

Her first offenss, being a lying little brat who sells out her own sister resulting in Ladies death. Side note: fuck Ned and his honor, he should have just set the wolf free. 

Anyways, so some bad stuff happens to her blah blah but then she takes it to the next level of evil by letting her little brother die because she's such a bitch that she'd rather let Ramsey kill him than simply tell Jon that the nights of the Vale will fight for her if she simply asks. I guess it's a tough call but why save your own baby brother when you can use his death to elevate your status in life? /S 

She let's Rickon die just so that she can prove a point to Jon that he would have lost the Battle of the Bastards without her and that she's more deserving of Winterfell than he is. She spends the rest of the series going around contributing nothing more than making snarky comments to everyone and does shit to help stop the Night King or Cersei. 

But then after all that she has the audacity to basically say, ""Look Bran, I know you're a Stark and all, so these white trash people of Winterfell should respect that but for some reason they won't."" And then she conveniently ends up being the Queen of the North even though she's done jack shit to earn it. 

Basically Sansa's character development is going from being a useless maiden in distress to a useless arrogant self entitled bitch who can't even figure out how a knife works. 

Just simply another example as to why it's difficult for me to find this ending satisfying in anyway. Basically it was just a bunch of shitty boring characters who didn't deserve a decent ending but got them anyway.

And for the love of God can someone please explain why Bronn was made Master of Coin?",64,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bu8phl/spoilers_sansa_is_the_power_hungry_one/,2019-05-29 05:51:01
252,br8ho2,[Spoilers] The ending of GoT was actually perfect and no one realized it,"Okay so besides the bland dialogue and the water bottle left next to Samwell Tarly’s foot, D&D actually concluded this series fantastically. I have a few points to share that can justify this episode. I can’t fix every flaw in the entire controversial season but maybe i can shed some light on the finale. The main point is that everyone won and the realm is now safe indefinitely.  Here are all the Game of Thrones pay offs in the finale......

1) The wheel is now broken:

With the iron throne melted by Drogon and the seven kingdoms now a fair republic, the wheel that Dany has been trying to break is now broken and a new order has been instated.  Now the lords of Westeros can have an equal vote on the succession of power. The North became an independent kingdom thanks to Sansa while still being Allies with The Crown. Minus the conquering of the entire world, Dany’s dream of the wheel breaking has come true. 

2)  Bran and Daenery’s visons came true:

Each of them had their own visions for the future. Dany envisioned arriving at the destroyed throne room with snow falling from the broken ceiling. The vision continues with Dany about to touch the throne when suddenly, she is now heading past the wall to a tent occupied by Khal Drogo and their child. This obviously references the afterlife because both of them died in season 1. In the finale, the same imagery was shown and when Dany touched the throne, the camera pans behind her to show Jon Snow. She doesn’t even have a chance to sit down on the throne before Jon sends her to the “afterlife” to reunite with Drogo and her son. Jon Snow is a symbol for “snow” falling down on the Targaryan Dynasty and making the ultimate sacrifice. Furthermore, Bran also had a vision in season 6 when he was in the process of becoming the three-eyed raven. His vision was a montage of imagery which mainly showed 3 specific (and important) characters. Excluding Cersei from this prophecy stuff, the three characters shown in the vision end up being the 3 key villains in the show: The Night King, King Aerys, and Daenerys. They are all huge players who end up being the biggest “bad guys”. King Aerys killed many innocents people and insisted on burning everyone in King’s Landing, which was paid off with his daughter (his blood) burning everyone. The Night King was a main villain and was almost successful in creating the endless night. Dany started off as a good person for most of the show until she lost everything and then began to fulfill her father’s plans. Bran’s vision foreshadowed Dany’s true destiny and the mad king’s wish coming true after all. Also, Bran’s vision showed a dragon’s shadow hovering above King’s Landing. 

3) Azor Ahai fulfilled:

Many people say Arya is the princess who was promised because she killed the NK. I believe all evidence still points to Jon (Aegon Targaryan). He is a true hero to the people and is loved by all. He killed a few White Walkers and warned everyone about the Night King’s arrival; which saved everyone. Jon has the strongest moral compass on the show and has done what was right since the beginning. This leads me to my final piece of evidence- Dany is Nissa Nissa from the Azor Ahai prophecy. Myths, legends, and prophecies are all known to manifest slightly different the second time around. Instead of forging a flaming sword, he drove an average blade through Dany’s heart, which in turn, created peace in the entire Realm. They were lovers without a doubt, maybe even true soulmates. Jon= Azor Ahai,  Dany= Nissa Nissa, and Arya= lightbringer? (That last one is open for discussion)

4) All hail the Starks:

Everyone’s favorite house in the beginning of the series has came a very long way. They were brutally losing the game of thrones for basically the entire show.  Ned- decapitated, Sansa-raped, Arya- on the run, Bran- crippled, Robb-betrayed and killed, Catelyn- killed after witnessing the massacre, Rickon- killed by Ramsay, and Jon struggling as a bastard while also discovering the Great War to come. Every Stark had a hard life after Ned died but the finale paid all of that off by rewarding house Stark. Sansa became Queen of the North. Bran (who’s also 3ER) now rules the entire realm. Arya is the first Stark (or human) to ever sail west to discover the unknown lands. And finally, Jon gets to leave all the lordships and politics that he resents  behind him. His is the most interesting because despite being the true heir to the seven kingdoms, he was raised in the north by Ned Stark and now gets to live in the true North with his best friend, his dire wolf, and a colony of wildlings and he embraces his Stark lineage. Since he doesn’t want the Crown and Throne, the only 2 reasonable options were death or exile for him. It was his destiny to kill the true enemy (Dany) and pay the consequences. House Stark for the win! (finally)

5) The Lord of Light

My theory is that the Lord is Light made his decision before the show even started. He used Robert’s Rebellion, the War of the Seven Kings,  The Great War (🔥/❄️), and the last war to create a clean slate and remove all toxic players from the game. I believe Bran is the physical embodiment of the Lord of Light just like the NK is the physical embodiment of darkness and winter. He orchestrated all of this and caused Jamie to cripple Bran in order to unlock his warging abilities and initiate his journey to become the new 3ER. All of these events happened exactly the way they were supposed to. Maybe the Lord of Light had to choose a warg in order to complete his plan and the Starks are secretly wargs by blood. Bran is the true born son of Ned and the last heir to Winterfel. This gives him the qualification to be a contestant for the throne. When Tyrion suggests Bran to be king, Bran replies by saying, “Why do you think i came all this way?” It’s not a coincidence that the 3 Eyed Raven is now the guardian of the realm and protector of men. Between Bran and the previous body before him, the 3ER may have been manipulating the past to create the perfect future. We learned in season 6 that he can change the future in dramatic ways (ex: Hodor holding the door). This was never discussed again after season 6 so maybe that was the only clue that was given to us for this theory. 

6) Major foreshadowing

I seriously doubt that Dan and Dave actually planned this far ahead in the pilot episode. However, i noticed something very similar between the last episode and the first. The first GoT scene in the pilot was a couple night’s watch members on a mission beyond the wall walking through the forest. The final scene of the whole entire series was Jon and Tormund ( the new Night’s Watch) wandering beyond the wall through a forest and on a mission to recolonize the wildlings. Very similar imagery right? Check this out... The last scene of S1 Ep1 not only kickstarted a whole story arc but also predicted the future king. Cinematography is key to this show. Most of S8 Ep 1 was supposed to mirror the pilot episode, but maybe the finale also mirrors it too. The pilot ends with Bran and so does the War for the Crown in the last episode. Think that’s cool? Check this out... Jamie is a “kingslayer” and Bran is secretly the future king. Jamie tried to kill Bran in the name of his love for Cersei. He obviously didn’t know Bran’s true destiny but it’s a nice little coincidence. 

Honorable Mentions:

• Jon finally petting Ghost 
• Sam is the main Maester of Kings Landing
• Bronn got his castle (and more)
•. Prodrick and Brienne become true knights and   
King’s guard to Bran
• “The Song of Ice and Fire” is finally completed and published by the maesters 
• Drogon went home to Essos where he was born
•Tyrion survives as the only living Lannister and redeems himself as Hand of the King (this one is poetic considering Tywin was Hand and treated Tyrion horribly throughout his life)
•Ser Davos Seaworth completes his arc by going from a poor smuggler in Flea Bottom to being the Master of Ships
•Everyone serves their purpose and peace is established in Westeros

Loose ends:

• Where is drogon’s final destination?
• What will Arya find on her new journey?
• What’s next for Jon, the wildlings, and the rest of the night’s watch?
•Will the wall be repaired since the NK is dead?
• What will Bran do next as king?
• Who will be the new Master of Whispers and Master of Laws?
          .....find out never on GAME OF THRONES 

In conclusion: These loose ends don’t actually need to be answered because ultimately, the show ended with the bitter sweet ending we were promised. The final episode could of had more complex and clever dialogue but nevertheless, it was a good ending. The world is at peace, all the arcs were paid off, every prophecy mentioned on the show was pretty much fulfilled, and the small questions are left open for speculation. There was the perfect balance of closure and mystery by end of the episode. The final season was very rocky but despite the criticisms against D&D, they ended the show just right. 
EVERYONE WINS!

253,zhwf5,"Drawings, paintings, cosplays, art, merchandise... Getting really tired of it.","Hi /r/gameofthrones,

I think I'm probably against the current here, but I really start to dislike the frontpage of this subreddit on a daily basis.

I know, there are no active episodes currently, so show-related content is pretty thin, but I'd rather have a FEW relevant threads discussing about the show, about the cast, about sets and locations, about Viewers-only theories. I also like to read people speculations about the future of the story (in the book or in the show), I enjoy reading readers reactions.

But another Jon Snow / Daenerys drawing ? GOT Coffee cup ? Brand new GOT Tshirt ? Khaleesi cosplays ? These were nice 1 year ago, now its just incredibly boring (to me). There MUST be some kind of compromise here. Just this morning its too much. I mean look the front page, and check how many drawings/paintings/goodies and stuff. 

I know, /r/asoiaf is here too, I subscribed to it too, and its a fine subreddit, but its more... ""elitist"" for a lack of better word. I like /r/got because its more fun, more casual, but I really dislike where its heading.

261,bj670u,"[Spoilers] STOP DEFENDING THE ARYA PLOT HOLE, PLEASE!","Guys, it is perfectly fine to be okay with a plot hole. No one is going to be angry at someone for having a greater ability to suspend their disbelief. Nothing is inherently wrong to look at something that doesn't make sense, over look it, and enjoy the content for what it is.

What is not okay, however, is to desperately try to make excuses for illogical things.

The fact is, Arya's skydive makes no logical sense, period:

1. The walls were not close enough to the weirwood tree to leap down from. The Godswood is huge, huge enough to have a lake, and the weirwood is in the middle of a forest. The walls are waaaaaaaay too far away from the weirwood to be able to leap over the White Walkers
2. The NK was indisputably surrounded by White Walkers, 360 degrees, no gaps. Overhead shots start around 1:11:00 and each time shows the NK with Theon and Bran, in the middle of a completely enclosed circle of WWs. There are multiple shots to choose from illustrating that the circle was completely closed and complete.
3. Arya's silence has nothing to do with being able to bump shoulders through a group of tightly packed people unnoticed when everyone is standing perfectly still
4. Arya, and no human in GoT, can jump 30 feet in the air over a group of people
5. The angle she came down on the NK implies she was falling from an elevated position while in the motion of moving forward. There were no trampolines in the Godswood
6. Arya did not put on a WW face (ridiculous theory in it's own right), Michael Jordan jump towards the NK, take the mask off mid air before making contact with him
7. She did not leap down from any trees. The weirwood stands alone in an open plain, and the angle she dropped down at is impossible to do from directly overhead. Not too mention, the WW hair wouldn't have moved if she was in a tree

&#x200B;

I just wished people would accept that they are suspending THEIR sense of disbelief when they are happy or content with Arya's Naruto moves. Please do not presume you know something the masses do not that makes the situation more believable. There are reasons people are upset with the scene, and they have a reason to be upset. It's not for you to decide if their disappointment is justified or not, when there is no logical explanation rationalizing that.

So please,  just enjoy the show for what it is, but don't try to plug a plot hole with paper towels.

&#x200B;

As an example, in this thread alone, the following assumptions have been made:

She jumped from a pile of dead bodies  
She jumped of the shoulders of a White Walker

She was too fast and ran through the group of White Walkers before they could catch her

265,bjmfdt,[SPOILERS] When (and why) did so many people's standards for this show change?,"Out of all of the criticism this past episode got, the only bit that seems reasonable is the darkness of it (and even that may have more to do with HBO's streaming services than the episode itself).

&#x200B;

Let's start with the lack of main characters dying.

&#x200B;

Whether or not you want to dip into the semantics of ""are Jorah and Theon main characters,"" they are unquestionably the closest thing to main characters that have ever died in battle on this show. Ned Stark was executed (not in battle), Rob and Catelyn Stark were assassinated (not in battle), Tywin, if you want to call him a main character, was murdered on the toilet, Oberyn (again, I don't think he was a main character) was killed in a trial by combat.

The biggest characters to die in an actual battle so far were.... Ygritte and..... Wun Wun? Am I missing any?

&#x200B;

Deus Ex Machina.

&#x200B;

Did that happen in this episode? Absolutely. Did this happen before the infamous passing of the books? Absolutely.

Battle of Blackwater: Tyrion is *fucked* due to an assassin hired by Cersei, but Golden-Cock Pod came out of nowhere and murdered the guy who was about to murder Tyrion.

Also Battle of Blackwater: Jamie is about to kill herself and Tommen because all was lost, when Tywin comes storming in out of nowhere to save the day for the Lannisters.

I actually don't remember any deus ex machina in the battle for Castle Black though!

It also happens a bunch of times in seasons 5-7, but we don't need to talk about them because it's not worth dealing with the ""The show has been shit for three years but I can't keep myself from watching and complaining about it after every episode"" crowd anyway. Unfortunately there aren't very many battles before the end of the books to draw from.

&#x200B;

Characters escaping from impossible situations.

&#x200B;

This is probably the most hilarious complaint of all of them. I would challenge anyone to point out any one of the characters who escaped from something they shouldn't have that hasn't already done it multiple times throughout the series. Let's find some examples.

Jon - Literally every season. Jon Snow is such a bumbling idiot that the man just keeps failing upwards. The one time he actually did have consequences for being an idiot, he was resurrected anyway (and save the ""it hasn't happened in the books"" line, because we all know it will).

Sam - At the end of (I think) season 2, Sam is literally surrounded by White Walkers and wights at the Fist of the First Men. At the beginning of next season, he's totally  fine with absolutely no explanation. He also killed a White Walker by himself. LOL.

Dany - See Jon. She's not as much as an idiot as him, but she's escaped from tons of situations where she absolutely should have died.

Arya - Should have been killed at the Red Keep in Season 1 but escaped with absolutely no skills whatsoever. Apparently the Starks' sworn enemies don't know what they look like? Even Tywin fucking Lannister had her as his serving girl without knowing who she was?

Etc, etc, etc...

The point is, everything other than the lighting issues has been established as happening before this battle, and for some reason, so many people decided to make it the worst thing in the world just all of a sudden.

267,6v017s,[S7E6] Multiple problems with the episode,"The one thing I love about GoT is that everything is done logically within the context of the GoT universe. In terms of all the decision making, everyone usually does things that make logical sense, and best of all, GoT doesn't have any cliche ""TV moments"" for shock value. It's why it's the best show on television. You do something stupid, you die, just like in real life. No 'hero' shields. 

However...I thought this episode had way too many of these moments that bothered me. (I won't even mention last week's Jaime 'hero' save)

1) Before I even mention this particular episode, the original ""plan"" established last episode makes absolutly no logical sense. They plan on going north, to catch 1 wight, bring it back south to convince Cersei to join them? Wtf? 

2) Why would they not all go with Gendry? They already got their wight, what was the point of separating? 

3) Why the fuck didn't they break the ice around the rock when they were being charged and the ice wasn't breaking? Instead they think going 7vs200 is a better option? Wtf? 

4) Why were the wights dropping like flies from simple sword strikes? I thought it only took fire to kill them?

5) How does barak flame his sword? Magic?

6) So...a raven went *all the way down* to dragonstone leading danny to go *all the way* back up north of the wall, in like... what? a couple days? Really? I know time doesn't mean much this season, but c'mon... That journeys' *at least* weeks...

7) Why were they all just standing there when he killed the dragon. GTFO, you're next. You can say shock but still...if your about to die I'd get over the 'shock' in about 3 seconds.

8) WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T BEN GET ON THE HORSE WITH JON?!? ""There's no time.."" Just get on the fucking horse, takes 2 seconds.

9) Where the fuck did the white walkers get giant-ass chains? How did they wrap it around a dragon under water? I thought they couldn't swim. If they could swim, why the fuck were they afraid to run on the ice earlier?

10) Why is Sansa going to littlefinger to air out her grievances? She constantly says how much she can't trust him yet goes to him to for advise?

11) ...lastly, how the fuck did Thoros' drink not finish lol? There's no way that thing lasts more than 3 big gulps and this dude was downing it every 5 minutes... *and* giving some away. All that and there was still some left to dump on his dead body? I'm half-joking with this one.

277,1g59v8,[S3E10] Anti-Dany argument,"Many people on this forum love Dany and I never really understood why, in my opinion she is the worst possible leader you could have and she hasn't really done anything but more and more people say she's their favourite character so here's my anti-dany argument.

She's been handed everything and anything she did get was gotten through treachery 

Her dragons were a gift, her army of unsullied was gained through lies and deceit, her main adviser was gained because she was attractive, Barristan joined her because he had nowhere else to go.

Her unsullied

You may say that she gave them freedom however she sacked their city killing thousands and then left it there without even trying to rebuild it, she says they can leave if they want but where would they go? The only cities nearby are slaver cities which would imprison them in a heartbeat, they gained no freedom at all by joining Dany.

She does nothing

All she does is bark orders and let her advisers act for her, she doesn't even lead her army.

She is a psychopath

This is mostly shown in the books however it is shown somewhat in the show too, for example she locked a man inside a vault with his lover and left them to starve to death without a second thought. She sacks a city and kills thousands just because she decides that slavery is wrong in a day, she watches smiling as her dragon burns down the city (also probably killing thousands of normal families) and as the unsullied massacre the slavers.

There are more points I could make however they are mostly from the books and not the show however just using the material from the show is enough, can someone please explain why you like her so much?

278,biqc32,[SPOILERS] This season is horrible.,"I'm a clairvoyant, I know that I will get a million downvotes but no counter-arguments because the people on this subreddit (and the fandom in general) can't take criticism. 

I've been watching the show and reading the books for as long as I can remember. Whenever people think about Game of Thrones or ASOIAF, I hope they think of the complicated, spider-web story structure, with dozens of sub-plots at any given moment.

It's really sad to see the state Game of Thrones is in now. I cringed when the plot device of destroying the White Walkers to destroy the entire army was introduced in the last season. It felt so cartoonish. It's literally Marvel's Avengers, where they blow up the big ship and all the aliens died instantly. That's exactly what happened in this week's episode as well. Or perhaps Lord of the Rings, where all the heroes are about to die but Frodo pulls through at the last moment and kills Sauron, so all of his minions die instantly.

George R.R. Martin has talked repeatedly in the past about how he doesn't try to follow fantasy tropes. It's why so many important, ""heroic"" characters die; because in fantasies like Lord of the Rings, Aragorn would never die. It's why being a generic good guy will get you killed; because people would exploit your honour to backstab you.

The show is now using generic fantasy tropes, despite how much GRRM said he never wanted to use them; how ASOIAF has always been about subverting the fantasy genre.

It's gets even worse. They established in the show that killing the White Walkers kills the wights they raise...Okay...so why does killing the Night King kill the other White Walkers? That's something that was not established. You can make 100 excuses about why and what, like ""well the night king created the other white walkers!"" it doesn't change the fact that it was not established.


I do find it hilarious that people thought that the show would be brave and kill off actually important characters, like Tyrion, Sansa, or Arya. No, I knew for a fact that this show would never have the guts to do that. So of course the only characters to die are useless tertiary characters like Beric Dondarrion, or characters who either completed their arcs seasons ago, like Theon or Melisandre. 

The show had been building up to the Night King for 4 seasons, and he's a complete, and utter failure of storytelling.

Absolutely embarrassing. I feel bad for George RR Martin for his work to be bastardized in such a corrupt, and disingenious manner. 

Bring on the downvotes. In fact, I think the moderators ban people who criticize the show.",258,270,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/biqc32/spoilers_this_season_is_horrible/,2019-04-29 18:49:43

280,5ttbre,[EVERYTHING] Is GoT a Metaphor for Climate Change?,"This is something that I've really thought hard about while watching this show. I see so many parallels to the events in this show and real life right now. We have a bunch of people arguing about petty politics and power all the time (much akin to the fight for the Iron Throne) and in the meanwhile, there are a small subset of people (scientists in real life, the men at the Night's Watch in the show) who are trying to warn the rest of the world/kingdom about an imminent danger that is threatening to quite literally destroy humanity (climate change or the White Walkers). The Night's Watch/scientists get ignored because their cries for help get drowned in the politics. 

In this last season, it is starting to look like no one will actually care about this threat until the threat is quite literally knocking on their door. In real life though, im not quite sure Climate Change can be combated in the last minute. 

I personally think it would be great if the show ended with the White Walkers ruling the world. It would send a great statement about the current political climate and a call to straighten out our priorities and save our Earth.

Thank god all you idiots who want to crucify Stannis aren't in charge of leading a siege on Winterfell. This isn't a fucking Disney movie where doing the ""right thing"" always works out for the best in the end. Stannis killed his daughter to ensure the hope of having a decent future for everyone. He clearly loved his daughter and would have preferred not to kill her. He's going to have to live with that shit for the rest of his life, and I'm sure he knows that. Not only was it the right decision, but this is why killing his daughter was the bravest, most selfless, and most rational thing he could have done. He did what he had to fucking do. The fire magic obviously works, even though it's probably some evil shit.

Is it possible that his most ulterior motives are impure? Possibly. Maybe he is power hungry. But we don't know that from this. It had to be done, regardless of his most inner motives.

295,bjx8m6,"[SPOILERS] Some of the hate Episode 3 is getting is completely off the mark, hear me out","Warning, this is long. And TLDR doesn’t catch it all.
But here it is anyway:

**TLDR**;

NK was always “pure evil”, the Sauron of Westeros, and GRRM never intended it to be anything else.

Theories went mad and people set themselves up to expect something else (Bran is NK, etc).

Plot armor is on the main characters until the end game and always has been – though we didn’t always know who the main characters are.

End game is human conflict, always was, NK was a just plot device to move the main characters along.


...


Let me start off by saying I’m a full-blown snobby book reader. 
I’ve read them 5 times before they were cool, and another 5 times since. I’ve been living with these characters since like 2000, recommending the books to all me friends, family etc., and I had looked down my nose upon the show-only peasants… 
Until the show hit season 5 and a number of my fellow book-readers started whining about series deviating from the books and been rubbish because they ran out of source material etc.
 
Some of them actively ruined the show for themselves and have spread that stuff to ruin the show for others.


And primarily among those, and people who completely misunderstood GoT in the first place, did complaining start and led to a point where now you have people who also don’t get it ruining it for other people and content creators on Youtube, etc. doing the same despite the fact they understand it even less.



I have to now put in the obligatory, “don’t get me wrong, episode 3 was far from perfect”…. Because it’s true. 


If you wanna complain that the Dothraki charge made no sense, go for it. If you wanna complain that the siege machinery was pointless, go for it. This is not the first time GoT battles do tactically questionable stuff to make a better impression in cinematography or suspense.

Battle of the Bastards had Jon doing his thing, Loot Attack Train had Lannisters not place a single scout to notice 40,000 Dothraki riders coming, Blackwater had Stannis – the King - charging (helmetless) first up the ladder on KL – oh I forgot, that was written by GRRM, so everyone concentrated on how cool Stannis was instead of how little sense it makes.

In fact, the only 2 battles where there wasn’t any tactical silliness was Battle for Castle Black and Hardhome.



My point is, you can complain about tactical nonsense in The Long Night – as long as you understand GoT always had some of it to increase the cinematic effect, increase the suspense, etc.
**EVEN IN THE EPISODE WRITTEN BY GRRM.**


And honestly, sometimes that’s fine. If you want a pitched battle of shield-wall vs shield-wall, not sure how to make it into quality TV.


(I’m not saying it couldn’t have been done better in all of those battles btw)


But that aside, the biggest three complaints are that NK wasn’t some deep, complex villain, the plot armor of some characters and “how predictable the show has become”.
So let me address that.



**Night King and Theories in General**



First of all, anyone who’s complaining about NK not being a deep, complex character doesn’t understand the series. There’s no nice way to say this, I’m sorry, you don’t.


NK is basically Sauron, always had been. Except in GoT, he’s not the end villain, he’s a means to an end, a plot mover for the main characters. Much like human non-main characters, on a smaller scale.
He is Stannis on a bigger scale (yes, book Stannis was a dick who killed his brother, wanted his nephew sacrificed and will kill his own daughter, sorry Stannis the Mannis fans), Renly, Euron (he’s doomed), Victarion, etc… Just on a bigger scale. 
ALL of them are plot movers for the main characters, some deep and complex, some less so, some likable, some less so, but all of them were never going to “win out” and this is something everyone who understood the series should’ve known by now.



**Your own idea of what NK is, not coming true... Is your own fault, and the fault of the internet and theories going wild.**



These books, while not perfect, are the best fiction work I’ve ever read (especially the first 3 books) and they’re written in a masterful way. 
But the foreshadowing and the hidden clues in the books are not written for the hive minds of millions of people and them looking for clues and making up theories (most of them BS), but for the one sole reader.


On my first read, I got nowhere close to R+L=J. I didn’t even catch Renly and Loras were a couple, let alone other, bigger stuff.



I think the best example of people blowing up theories out of proportion is the Valonqar prophecy for Cersei. 
For the one book reader, as we get it from Cersei POV, the Valonqar is “younger brother” – Tyrion.


As a twist, which not every single book reader will get on his own, the Valonqar will be Jaime.


But since Valonqar is gender-neutral (much like PTWP), people have made up theories on it being Arya, Margaery, etc. And while most still think now (their GoT brains backed by internet) that Jaime is the Valonqar, you need to understand a LOT of (good) write-ups were done about others fulfilling the prophecy, a bunch of people biting into it etc.


It blew up, got out of proportion, to a point where the books never meant to go.



Same for the NK, same for Bran.
A lot of these (mostly silly) theories came up, Bran is the NK, Bran is Bran the Builder, Bran made the Mad King go mad, etc.
People set themselves up to except something entirely different, through no fault of GRRM or HBO, and now they’re upset.

According to GRRM himself, the “end boss” of GoT is human conflict. Always has been.

The overarching undead threat is a plot device to move the main characters into positions, but the end game was always going to be between humans -  politics, betrayal, wars, relationships, etc.


Night King is basically Sauron. The show gave him a face because it makes for better TV, but he’s not some deep, complex character, dude is “pure evil, a fantasy cliché if you will – but a cliché who is NOT what the show is about.


If you didn’t get that, it’s your own fault. 
But it’s not shitty writing or whatever just because you set yourself up to expect something different.



**Plot Armor and “Everthing is Predictable”**



Again, there’s no nice way to say this – if people expected the main cast to die in Episode 3, you don’t get the series.
If your complaint is that “everything has predictable since season 5”, you don’t understand the series.



**No character in the series died just to shock you.** (well, show Barristan went out a bit pointlessly)



People die for two reasons in the series (otherwise their story is not worth telling):

-	They completed their character arc (Theon, Jorah…)

-	Their death is a plot/story mover for other main characters in an important way (Ned, Robb, etc.) 


That said, not all characters who completed their own story arc have to die (Brienne and Torumund were two candidates in Episode 3), just to be clear on that. But they do lose their plot armor.



The surprises stop at some point because the good guys win out in the end. It will be bittersweet, but it’s what will happen.
In order for that to happen, the main cast need to get to finish line (what happens then is something entirely different).


Ned’s death was surprising because he was the “main character” in both books and the show.

In the books, Robb was always “under threat” AFAIC as he didn’t have his own POV, but he was still the avenging son – even more so on TV where you don’t know that he does not have his own POV in the books.

But their deaths moved everything into place, there’s no war without Joffrey executing Ned, etc.


 
And it’s not like plot armor just came in for these guys NOW. Jon was saved by Stannis from Mance even in the books, was let in by the wildlings after killing Qhorin Halfhand for a rather inferior reason in the books (In the show he tells Mance he saw a white walked take Craster’s boy and NW ignored it, there’s no such thing in the books), etc.



Don’t get me wrong, I do agree episode 3 could’ve done with less “placing character into a seemingly inescapable situation, character escapes”, but it was far from anything that would ruin the episode and the suspense for me.


The Starks, Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Jaime and Cersei were all going to see the end game. It’s the whole point of their story, it's the whole point of the series, and if they died before it their story would not be worth telling. 


The show has been predictable because all the characters got to a “low point” and have been moving into position for the end game ever since. 


(I mean, FFS, the original title for the last book was “A Time for Wolves”…)


And the end game starts now, AFTER killing the Night King.


If you think the last episodes will be as simple as “defeat Cersei, the end”, I’m pretty sure you got another thing coming.


But see the thing is… My friends and me, we *KNEW* NK was going to be defeated, all my friends watching together knew this did (though not all thought it was going to be in episode 3). We all *KNEW* that the main cast will survive. We *KNEW* that.

Yet still, when Arya killed the NK, you had a room of 38-45 year old people, male and female, with tears in their eyes bro-fisting each other.


It was quality TV. It could’ve been done better, maybe even should have – but all these posts calling it a disaster or something, especially for the wrong reasons… Most of them are off the mark.


Shitty battle strats, fine. But most of the other stuff is people setting themselves up for something other than what the series was always about.


Enjoy this fucking show because everything put together, it’s the best show on TV since The Wire.

It’s got flaws, but on the whole, it’s a fucking masterpiece.


(in fact, all things considered, I only got 2 major complaints through 8 seasons – Dorne plot, it had to be changed from the books, but not like that… and the casting of Euron, a missed opportunity to have a mysterious, insane, charismatic villain instead of a dude in a leather jacket)

309,bdnr6p,"[SPOILERS] Sansa Should Show More Respect, She Doesn't Have The Slightest Clue","Let's get real for a moment, I can understand all the love she's getting but I do think a lot of it is undeserved. Sansa throws shade at Dany immediately, but why? Sansa must believe that she's a survivor who earned her title, but let's compare the two:
*Both were pretty much sold into marriage, but while Sansa cowered and submitted to her torturers, Dany actually took the time to do some research and make hers fall in love with her.
*Both were very young girls put into a horrible situation, but while Sansa endured her abuse and stayed quiet, Dany demanded respect from those who thought they owned her.
*Dany was birthing dragons and breaking chains to earn her power while Sansa was saved by man after man. Even when The Hound offered to take Sansa home and protect her what did she do? She decided to put her faith in Stannis, a man she had never met, instead of the one who saved her from getting raped.
*Both women faced undesirable traitors who didn't have their best interest at heart, but while Sansa decided to keep Little Finger close and almost allow him to drive a wedge between her and her only sister, Dany outsmarted the ones she came across and just burned their asses alive.

Bottom line- Sansa would have never gotten where she is now without the help of undesirable  men while Dany pretty much put herself in her position. It's no wonder Dany thinks she's a Queen, she survived by earning the respect she feels she deserves from the men around her  while Sansa was protected, coddled, and hand delivered into the position she has now. Why is Sansa the Lady of Winterfell? Because John gave it to her. Why does Dany think she's the Queen? Because in her own words ""I had faith in myself"".",63,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bdnr6p/spoilers_sansa_should_show_more_respect_she/,2019-04-16 04:58:11

311,6v04mz,[EVERYTHING] This has gone too far,"I don't wanna say the show jumped the shark, but this episode has asked for the most suspension of disbelief since arya did parkour with several fatal wounds to the gut.

1) The pacing is completely and utterly fucked. Within a matter of minutes, we're sending an unarmed Gendry to navigate the north (who just saw snow for the first time 10 minutes earlier) to go run back to the wall and send a raven. Then we're gonna assume that he made it. Then minutes later, Dany is on Drogon, shortly saving all their asses for that incredibly half-witted suicide mission.


2) This could've been my misinterpretation of the fight scene, but I'm almost positive that the choreography of the fighting scenes showed about 4 people die, yet at the end of the battle, Thoros of Myr was still the only one dead. 


3) They couldn't even be bothered to show if Rhaegal made it out of that mess alive, or even show him flying off with Drogon


4) I shouldn't even have to mention the plot armor on all of them during that fight scene, but I will. That was even a stretch for this show, and the icing on the cake was Jon's magical emergence from the icy waters. 


5) Benjen's 30 second redemption. This was a garbage way to send him off. Felt utterly rushed, forced, and strictly served as plot armor to keep Jon alive.


6) Last but not least: **How in the actual fuck did the white walkers manage to find ship grade anchor chains????**

I love this show more than the average fuck, but this episode really grinded my gears.

315,c6mgrc,"[Spoilers] Dany's ""Turn"" Was Justified?","Well, a ""turn"" is not quite the right word, because from my perspective, from season 1, she wasn't quite right in the head.  She never really turned as much as she grew into it. It's who she was. And by season 2, she had evolved to be a person capable of genocide, exemplified by her consideration of doing it, which no sane or truly moral person would ever threaten, let alone consider.

&#x200B;

From that point, she continually battled between doing good things and terrible things in Slavers Bay, Asatapor,  Yunkai and Meereen, also including the Dothraki capital. We just didn't pay much attention to the terrible things because:

A) They were terrible and cruel things done to terrible and cruel people. Who cares, right? The Dexter phenomenon.

B) They were done to red shirts, or characters we cared nothing about, had little to no attachment to or were antagonists or barriers in the way of Dany's goals. We all wanted to see her go to Westeros and take the throne. 

C) We liked Dany, faults and all. We wanted her to succeed. We paid little attention to the terrible things she was doing because of our bias for her and instead often cheered as she smiled while roasting people alive and demanding to hear their suffering and deathly screams and so on ... Hmmm, I think that says a lot about our own morality too, quite frankly.

And I think it's no coincidence that the people who generally did not like Dany, or at least not very much, seemed to have been far more accepting  of her actions in Season 8 Episode 5. Some of these people had even been calling her arc for many years in advance.

&#x200B;

It's only when she comes to Westeros and begins interacting with characters and people we do care about that we start to really question her sanity and specifically by this I mean the general audience at large. 

Then consider that by this time, it's season 7, the show is literally almost over, thus giving the surface impression of a rapid arc that was not developed properly. In actuality, it had been building since season 1, but primarily season 2. 

It's really only on revisiting the series or on reflection of Dany's entire arc that we can begin to appreciate how fleshed out of a hero and villain she really is from the very beginning and as a consequence, begin to have a lot more appreciation for Season 8 Episode 5 and at least the first half of Season 8 Episode 6.",52,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/c6mgrc/spoilers_danys_turn_was_justified/,2019-06-28 20:43:56

322,bkatz7,"[SPOILERS] Game of Thrones ""The Long Night"" is the worst written episode in the entire show!","lemme try to point out all the flaws or most of them in the episode and show you why this episode is probably the worst written episode in the entire show.

**- Battle Plan -** Dany has spent years and years collecting the Dothraki army, surviving death countless times to gain their respect, She crossed The Dothraki Sea and the Red waste to Quarth then went to Slaver Bay then back to The Dothraki Sea then all the way to winterfell.. After all that they decided to blindly send them to face 100k wights they can't even see? I don't understand their battle plan? They want to lure out the night king assuming that all of his army will die when he dies without actual proof of that, also assuming that he is stupid enough to brazenly chooses to risk everything by personally coming into the inner God's wood to find bran, If that was the case why even mount a defense? To get to bran, the wights have to get through all of their defenses, the cavalry, the infantry, the moat, the interior army, bran's personal guards.. Their plan is LITEARLLY for everyone to die and lose the battle completely just for the OPPORTUNITY to get to the night king WITHOUT PROOF it will even work....??

**- Lighting -** I know this has nothing to do with writing but i had to point it out. This episode was the most hyped episode of the entire series of GoT and broke records for the amount of people who tuned in to watch it, Instead of adjusting the lighting to fit most people they made it like that, Some say it was for Immersion? It wasn't Immersive it was frustrating! If the Characters inside the episode can't see doesn't mean the Viewer has to not see as well, most people want to see what is happening, Make it bright and for those who want an ""Immersive"" Experience, they can just lower the brightness..

**- Plot Armour -** In the first attack they show Brienne being swarmed by armed wights.. they cut away then cut back & she's fine? One handed Jaime who could barely fight survived? Brave warriors that have been trained for years died instantly but Chubby Sam who can barely run and has been knocked down dozen times and was swarmed by armed wights survived? In the laughable courtyard scene where they show all of interior army dead, all except our main characters..? Sansa, Tyrion and Varys survived the attack in the crypts somehow. Theon and his men were surrounded by armed wights, they cut away then cut back and most of the wights vanished..? Jon was surrounded by wights they cut away and cut back and most the wights vanished? It gets to the point where you aren't afraid of them dying anymore.

**- General Plot Holes -**

\- The Undead Dragon Managed to take down an 8,000 years old wall but couldn't destroy a pile of rocks Jon was hiding behind? They Literally Showed him destroy parts of the wall with his fire in the same episode!!

\- The NK touches a baby and it turns him into a WW. NK touched Bran in a VISION and Bran gets a permanent mark on his arm. NK throat grabs Arya! And Nothing..

**- Character Problems -**

**Arya:** Her Character story-wise probably is the most ridiculous in the episode! She Trained for years to be an assassin, She was fighting fine in battle but Spontaneously get spooked in the middle and forgets how to fight but then she gets saved by a man who keeps getting resurrected and then a weird women who is obsessed with prophecy quotes her fencing instructor from like eight years ago giving her the motivation to sneak past hundreds of zombies to stab his all-controlling leader who recklessly wanted to kill his nemesis himself..... WHAT? Logistically it might even be more ridiculous! What has she been doing since she left Melisandre? How did she get from the Library to the God's wood through that huge battle going on? Wights can hear her blood drops so how did she get past hundreds of wights and dozen white walkers to get close to the NK? Why is she flying in from above? Don't tell me she was hiding in a tree because a WW sees her zip by. This is just absurd on so many levels, I feel like they did that just for the sake of subverting our expectations and nothing more. Since D&D wanted to “subvert our expectations” they should have went all the way and had Ironman kill the NK. He is a stark after all.﻿

**Jon:** He's Character has been built upon the WW for some many years, He had two stare downs with the NK, He had the most connection with the WW & NK but he doesn't do anything! He rode a dragon then fell then fought couple of wights then gets saved by dany then got pinned down by a dragon... that's it? THAT was his contribution to the Great War? They didn't make him fight the NK just because it was expected?? IT IS EXPECTED BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE! I don't care if he gets to kill the NK or not but they should of at least fought.. Make him feel like he did something other than being useless.

**Sam:** All he did this episode was get Edd killed which is a shame, after all who wants to trade a competent character that people like for an incompetent character that no one likes. He should of died at least 5 times this episode. His Character would have been way more useful in the crypts defending people there, Tyrion, Sansa and varys survival would make a little more sense if he was defending them. but no, they made him a plot device for Edd's death... shame.

**Bran:** He did nothing throughout the entire episode! He warged into some crows and flew away until the NK came.. He probably knew that arya was gonna kill the NK because he sees the present and he should of saw arya coming he Literally looked at the area where arya stabs him, so if he saw arya coming why did he let Theon get himself killed? Why didn't he tell him to wait? He intentionally got him killed for what? What was Bran's Purpose throughout the episode other than bait? So Hodor death, Jojen's Death, Meera's Sacrifice all that journey purpose was just to act as bait? That is his contribution? They ruined so many great potential it's disappointing..

**The Night King:** His Story Arc is the worst in the entire show, They Killed him off, The Villain that you've built up 8 years since before we even saw the main credits Without giving us any answers as to what their motivations are, and in an anticlimactic fashion, They made him generic ""bad guy"" all the fantasy gone, all nuance gone, all purpose gone. which goes against the essence of what made season 1-4 so great. The White Walkers purpose was to show that the fight between the 5 kings is nothing compared to the great threat coming, Put they in ended up to be just a plot device to lower dany's and jon's army and that's it, that was their purpose... lel

&#x200B;

You can enjoy the episode, that's okay. You can enjoy all the illogical decisions that were made for the sake of emotional factor that's okay,  after all, since season 5 the series was made to entertain those groups of audience who don't care of things are logical. but don't you dare say that the episode was 10/10 perfection, because it has flaws that possibly ruins the show forever!",93,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bkatz7/spoilers_game_of_thrones_the_long_night_is_the/,2019-05-03 21:05:33
323,bpwwht,[Spoilers] I actually think Season 8 Daenerys was actually incredibly well done,"If you look at the history of Daenerys, her first reaction to anyone who wronged her is fire, blood, torture, and death. Hell, half to Selmy's & Jorah's time in the Esso cities in attempting to get Dany to see the value of mercy, as she crucifies slave owners, burns people alive, enjoys watching her enemies suffer, and whose first reaction is always kill 'em all.

When she comes to Westeros, there is no change. Burning people, dissenters, anyone who doesn't bend the knee. Every conversation with everybody is about her obsession with ruling and bending the knee and taking her rightful place as the Queen of the seven kingdoms.

She is a complex character, and over the years has shown mercy and regret - but 100% of those times were regarding people she deemed ""innocent"". Anytime anyone wrongs her, she is ready to burn them alive.

And so we get to King's Landing. A city that doesn't want her. A city that has shown no desire to rise up against Cersei and declare Dany their rightful Queen. No desire to bend the knee and accept their rightful Queen. According to Dany, they are just as guilty as the rest, and she says as much in Season 8. The ""innocent"" people of the slave cities accepted her with open arms, but the King's Landing population is as guilty as Cersei for not accepting Dany as their true Queen.

Dany's reactions are exactly as I'd expect after her history and her reaction to people who don't immediately accept her rule and people who she deems as her enemies.

The bells rang, the guards were cowering in fear, and there was no love for Dany - no sense of acceptance or the city celebrating being liberated. They were all guilty to her.

A lot of people think that Dany being a mad queen isn't the problem, it's ""how"" she turned mad - ie. too quickly - but personally I think it was done extremely well, didn't really need any more build up. She lost all her advisors begging her for mercy, save for Tyrion who conspired with Varys who was trying to have her poisoned. 

This is the real Dany, unrestrained and making her own choices about how to deal with those who refuse to bend the knee.",84,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bpwwht/spoilers_i_actually_think_season_8_daenerys_was/,2019-05-18 01:19:59
324,4gyy60,[NO SPOILERS] How Game of Thrones helped pull me through depression,"A little over two years ago I tried to kill myself. A couple of times, actually. It either did or didn’t go ‘well’, depending on how you look at it. Since then, I’ve been trying to find my way out of the emotional and psychological depths and to find reasons to get up in the morning and do more than sit and stare at the wall. George R.R. Martin’s ‘Song of Ice and Fire’ has been one of those reasons.

A major part of depression is the relentless criticism of your (perceived) failings, lack of direction, lack of meaning, etc. It’s the cynical, sarcastic, forever-displeased reviewer of your self and your actions. Wouldn’t it be great to just turn that voice off? Well… probably not.

Rejecting the cynical, critical part of yourself can be as damaging as listening to it exclusively; like many people, I tend towards the all-or-nothing approach, but guess what? Those are by definition extremes, and extremes aren’t a sustainable place to be day in and day out.

As a lot of the self-help lit reminds us, you can only move forwards out of anxiety, depression and self-esteem issues by coming to accept yourself. That doesn’t mean accepting the fact you have a penchant for strangling kittens which *will not be denied*… but you can accept, at least, the fact there’s something weird about all of us, and that it can find a (non-harmful) expression.

Reading is often touted as an escape, and in some ways it is. But at another level it actually brings us much closer to reality: when we read a really good book, we get to hear the voices in other people’s heads; we get to observe how others interact without being caught up in the middle of things ourselves. We get to hang out with kings and queens, beggars and thieves; with people like us and kinds of people we never realised existed. George R.R. Martin’s remarkable ‘Song of Ice and Fire’ saga might have dragons in it, but it’s always been the characters and their struggles, machinations and relationships which have made the series truly compelling.

Reading these books has helped me better understand other people and myself; showing me how there’s rarely such a thing as a straightforwardly ‘good’ or ‘bad’ person (who can say they thought Jaime was a sympathetic character in book 1? Or that they could even begin to fathom what goes on in the heard of Petyr Baelish?). The pain of telling myself I was a ‘bad person’ (and even feeling physically sick when trying to say or think I was a ‘good person’) was increasingly diluted after entering the minds and hearts of these complex characters. And, when it comes to accepting yourself, there’s a genuine depth of wisdom in Tyrion’s advice to Jon Snow: 'Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.’ Easier said than done… but it takes us right back to the need for self-acceptance before all else.

And so, instead of turning the critical, cynical part of my personality inwards and attacking myself, or suppressing the sarcastic part of myself that tends to get me into trouble, I recently decided to turn it into something creative: [Misanthrotees](http://misanthrotees.com).

Martin reveals something very important about the world: it is often bitterly harsh and unfair. But if that was all there was to it, it’d be impossible to become invested in the story or the characters; even as my own life seemed grey and meaningless, these books were a small flame of hope in the night (which, as we know, is dark and full of terrors). Love, morality, honour, sex, loyalty, revenge… These are all things we focus on to give our lives meaning in an uncaring universe. When you’re depressed, none of them seem enough to make you care. But George did make me care, and for that I’ll always be grateful, and not in the flippant hashtag-happy sense.

I’m not sure if ‘laughter is poison to fear’, as George writes in 'Game of Thrones', or at least not a fatal poison, but it certainly gives it a kicking. Here’s my take: as we stare into the jaws of our own mortality, we might as well go laughing. No one’s getting out of this alive, so hey – before we go, let’s play. So I made this t-shirt as an expression of that sentiment. It makes me laugh and makes me feel alive. I hope it might do the same for you too. – https://misanthrotees.myshopify.com/collections/men/products/game-of-life",17,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4gyy60/no_spoilers_how_game_of_thrones_helped_pull_me/,2016-04-29 15:29:35

326,35bm8l,[All Spoilers] I binged the series this week for the first time and there was one character who I really didn't like... (Really can't the spoiler tag enough.),"So, not trying to be clickbait, but had I mentioned Robb Stark with spoilers, it could have been considered spoilery.

So, I didn't want to just come to the subreddit and start yelling hate until I had had time to ""let it breath"". The Red Wedding. It's a commonly spoken up subject in the series. I wanted to know if anyone else saw it quite like I did.

Robb Stark is a straight up asshat. Pardon me, I just had to get that off my chest. He lead his own Mother to her death because he had to be his ""Own Man"". For 2 seasons he waltzed around the North thinking he could do whatever he wanted to do because he was Ned's son.
""I can break whatever vows I took, I don't have to work with the Karstarks, I can do whatever I want. I'm Ned Stark's son."" That's how I felt his entire reign as ""King"" of the North went. She warned him, and played the role of a good mother and followed her son through thick and thin. And she died because of it.

That, to me, was the most tragic part of the whole ordeal. That in the end, Catelyn believed her two youngest sons were dead, and her daughters were in the hands of the most vile people in all of the Seven Kingdoms. She lost her beloved husband. Her home was burned to the ground. And her future grandchild, and her eldest, and to her belief, only remaining son was murdered right in front of her. And he lead her right into it. 

TL;DR - Robb Stark is a dickbag.

Did anyone else feel the same way?

327,bpi1qy,[NO SPOILERS] Unpopular Opinion: The D&D hate is a bit much,"As many have pointed out, HBO allegedly gave D&D the opportunity to extend the series for a couple of more seasons to fully flesh out the story. Many therefore put blame on D&D for the rush job on the story and finale of the series. No doubt, D&D get some of the blame for this season's quality issues, but I believe HBO and GRRM share just as much blame as D&D.

HBO had the opportunity to find different writers, but rightfully they were concerned about the impact changing writers would have on the quality of the series. GRRM had almost a decade after knowing full well of the success of GoT to finish off the series to provide source material for D&D OR ensure HBO could hire different writers with the assurance that the new writers would have source material to work with.

If any of us were provided the opportunity to work on projects we are passionate about, as the case is for D&D and Star Wars, we would take that opportunity in a heartbeat. It's a bit much to blame someone for not wanting to keep working several years on something they are no longer passionate about.

Hey everyone!  There were some requests for information regarding nude scenes or scenes sexual in nature for tonight's episode.  So I'm going to post here what parts of episode 7 you should skip if you need to avoid those scenes.

I will post the time stamp start and end time of these scenes.  **Note:** these time stamps are based on watching GoT on HBO Now so it may not line up perfectly if you are watching it by other means. In HBO Now there is usually an HBO preview, a ""previously on"", and the intro to GoT before the actual episode and so my time stamps will have that incorporated.

Also I will post the few seconds leading up to the scene in case the time stamps don't match and how far to skip ahead.

I will also post if anything important plot-wise happens during the scene (I will post with a spoiler tag in case you don't want to know what happens until you're watching it).

Here goes:

.

#1

* Time Stamp: 36:45 to 40:15

* Duration: 3.5 mins

* Immediately Before (when to skip):  the scene starts right after House Glover denies allegiance to House Stark

* Important Plot Point: [S06E07](#s ""Yara and Theon discuss their plans.  Yara suspects Euron will be looking for them.

341,d7f2d6,[SPOILERS] A tiny change in the end scene of s8e3 that would make the entire Bran story line a little more meaningful.,"Okay, so the change starts when Arya jumps on the NK. Unlike most people I don't really mind that she did this, but that's not important here.

The NK grabs her throat just the same, makes his cocky smile and kills her by crushing her throat. As the dagger is falling down, Bran wargs into Arya's dead body, her blue eyes open, then grabs the dagger and stabs the NK just like it happened in the show. 

This give the entire Bran story line so much better. Also gives a better ending to Arya. Gets rid of both fan complaints of 1: no main character death in the episode, 2: Arya being the one who kills him, and 3: Bran doing nothing important the entire fight.",10,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/d7f2d6/spoilers_a_tiny_change_in_the_end_scene_of_s8e3/,2019-09-21 23:32:02
342,4p7fvd,"[EVERYTHING] Littlefinger's biggest secret, the end of the Iron Bank, and the hidden power of the Starks. The theories D&D don't want you to know about.","I have three main (hilarious nonsense) conspiracy theories that i've been cultivating that i'll be discussing here.

The first many may be familiar with, that is:

#There are secret portals throughout Westeros at various locations, controlled by the major families.

Evidence:

* **Littlefinger**: His teleporting has been the most obvious. His ability to travel between the Vale and Winterfell, within episodes sometimes makes this nearly certain. The distance here is about 1331 miles, and just take something like 60 days. However, I suspect that he found the portal via Lysa at some point, and this is why he was so intent on taking control of the Vale. I suspect the portal has something to do with the moondoor, however, he's able to get an entire army through it as in the last episode (s06e09). I'd argue that it goes to the Wolfswood to the NW of Winterfell, but perhaps to the mountains to the NE near Long Lake. He makes this teleportation twice, only after he seizes control of the Vale, so i suspect Lysa was preventing him from full access to it.

* **Ships of Stannis & Jamie**: While Littlefinger's teleportation is to the same location, i suspect there is a portal with more than one exit, or possibly a series of portals, in the sea, near Dragonstone. Stannis obviously uses one to get north of the wall in a very short period of this obscene distance. The exit is probably hidden in some inlet in Skagos east of the wall. Jamie seems to also use this portal region, *both directions* in his trip to Dorne. The exit is likely in the stepstones, though perhaps not as the pirates there would likely be seen showing up near Dragonstone (though maybe the pirates are a myth to keep other ships away). 

* **Brienne**: She travels same 1800 miles, from the wall, or near the wall, to Riverrun. This leads to the theory that maybe each portal has multiple exits, and with the knowledge of Sansa, she was able to access the portal outside of Winterfell, leading to an exit near Riverrun. This is the source of the outrage the Lannisters have with the Brotherhood Without Banners, who may find access to this portal.

* **Yara & Theon**: I’d been theorizing about a “western portal” as all the portals discovered thus far are on the east coast, but last week (s06e09) confirmed my suspicion. The Iron Islands to Slavers’ Bay in a couple weeks… it’s equivalent to going from halfway around the world. It’s also backed up with the fact that the Ironborn are fine with independence, even though their only trading partner would be Westeros. It’s obvious that they’d be able to trade with the cities around slavers’ bay quite easily. Imagine Dany’s army attacking from the west coast of Westeros… now you’re thinking with portals!

Arguments against: 

* **Why Ravens?**: I agree that this initially seems problematic if they just have portals, but you have to realize how secret these portals are. They are the best kept secret in the kingdom. You at least need plausible deniability about how messages are being sent. It’s also possible the portals run on some type of fuel, or need some time to recharge after they are used, thus, you’d only want to use them when necessary. Anyway, normal people still need the USPS, even though we have airplanes.

Now, getting back to slaver’s bay...

#Dany’s conquest of Slaver’s Bay lead to a massive collapse in manufacturing which has affected the entire known world, reaching as far as Westeros, and will lead to the Iron Bank of Braavos collapsing. 

Evidence:

* **Hair Dye Shortages**: Let’s be honest here, the Lannisters’ hair is darkening. Since Dany started taking cities in Essos, the Lannisters’ beautiful blonde hair has faded into brown. I don’t think it’s too difficult to speculate that this is the result of interrupted trade between Essos due to the attacks Dany has been mounting. We know from the books that the people in Essos are known for their crazy hair dye. They are always dying it dumb colors like college freshmen. Wouldn’t it make sense then that the hair dye is imported from Essos? Wouldn’t it also be reasonable to presume that the interruption is because some badass lady is going around freeing all the slaves, wrecking (at least temporarily) the economy. Proof of this will be if Tyrion’s hair becomes blonde again now that he is in Essos, however he may not due to his seeming rejection of his family.

* **Lannisters’ Debts**: We know the Iron Bank isn’t excited about loaning the Lannisters any more money. Why not? What do they know? Why have tax revenues dried up? Interruption of trade, and the financiers in Braavos know it, and they’re concerned. 

However, the biggest objection here is why this is not overtly mentioned. Besides the fact that modern economic theory is probably not well understood, my guess is that GRRM is hiding something big. If there is concern at the Iron Bank, it should be serious. Their bet on Stannis didn’t pay off. Their bet on the Lannisters is dying quickly (and we know it will die when Tommen dies if Cersei’s fortune is true). If there *is* an economic collapse that we are just learning of, we can see it’s effect stretches all the way to Westeros. That’s three strikes on the Iron Bank… and it will collapse at *exactly* the time when everyone need money to pay armies. 

One other curious event regarding this hair dye conspiracy… Sansa’s hair has darkened as well. Was she dying? If she was, in a roundabout way, it lends credence to my third, and most groundbreaking theory…

#The Stark family has a special healing ability that grants them near immortality, and nearly half of the Stark children may not, in fact, be Starks.

Evidence for:

* **Jon Snow**: If R+L=J, as it’s fairly obvious at this point, this is the most clear evidence for the theory. He “dies” some mystic says a few incantations while giving him a sponge bath, and voila… he’s alive again. I’m calling bullshit. He was never dead, he was in a coma, and his body healed himself.

* **Arya**: Stabbed in the gut, knife turned. Then, a couple days later, she’s fine. At least fine enough to leap from buildings and sword fight in the dark. Any normal person would have bled out, if they were lucky, which she apparently was, some medicine and months of bedrest assuming no infection. However, with her Stark blood, she’s healed nearly instantaneously. 

* **Benjen**: So, apparently Benjen was stabbed with a whitewalker’s ice sword, was left for dead, but was saved when the children of the forest stabbed him again with dragonglass. Yea, with all that stabbing, i’m guessing any normal person would be dead, but not if they have the Starks’ healing factor.

* **Stark’s symbol is a direwolf**: this is clearly an homage to Marvel’s Wolverine.

Arguments against:

* **Ned**: This is easily answered. The Stark healing factor has one weakness: beheading. This is a nod to the Highlander franchise, and this homage makes sense as the north is obviously meant to represent Scotland.

* **Robb**: He was also beheaded, as his direwolf’s head was sewn to his body after his death (in the books). 

* **Bran**: This is where things get interesting. The Bran argument has two counterarguments. Firstly, you could point out that Bran should have died. Instead, he’s paralyzed. Now, if it were a true healing factor, he should be able to walk again. However, the show hints that this will likely not happen. So he is either constantly healing himself, possibly overpowering his constant use of healing factor into enhancing his warging abilities, as if his healing factor ever disappeared, he’d die, or and this is where things get interesting… I think it’s clear that after Ned returns to Winterfell with Jon Snow, Catelyn, enraged at his infidelity begins cheating on him. This may explain quite a few other objections. It may also explain why Sansa’s hair is darkening if she’s dying to prevent this infidelity from becoming known.

* **Rickon**: There are quite a few ways to interpret the theory here. First, and most obvious, is that Rickon was the result of Catelyn’s infidelity. He would thus have no healing factor. One could also suggest that he’s not actually dead, but merely in a coma similar to Jon’s and will heal and return like Jon did, which is why he’s being put in the crypt instead of buried. There is also a direwolf explanation that i’ll discuss below.

**Connection to King’s Blood**: There is a theory connecting great power to King’s blood. This is suggested by the Melisandre constantly. However, how does some mystic come up with this nonsense, as “Kings” in Westeros are constantly changing. My guess is that the Stark healing factor has been told about as myth, and has over a long period been associated with Kings, rather than Starks. If this is the case, there may be some other Starks we may not know about:

* *The Red Wedding*: Why would the Lannisters wreck their reputation when they’d already clearly outmatched the Starks’ slapdash army? Answer, Qyburn's influence made it happen. He'd learned of Stark blood, and pushed the Lannisters to do it, but with the intention of collecting the blood. I propose that Cersei wanted to save the Mountain, and Qyburn, after his long studies into religion and history, finally had a test subject. They need to kill enough Starks to do a blood transfusion to bring back the Mountain, which they'd gathered from the Red Wedding, which turns out to be successful. Who will the second test subject be?

* *Gendry*: His blood is used and has power, but if the healing factor is actually Starks’, then he’s obviously a Stark. Could he be fathered by Ned, perhaps Benjen (both brown of hair)? Perhaps his lineage goes back farther than that. His blood changes fate, but Shireen’s death doesn’t. 

**Direwolf Theory**: Another theory to explain the stark healing factor, or lack thereof, is that the healing factor is tied to their direwolves. Robb’s dies, rob dies. Rickon’s dies, rickon dies. If this theory is true, then be wary of Sansa, as her’s has also died, if she dies, but not Arya or Jon, then it lends credence to this theory. 

So, there there it is. Portals hidden throughout, hair dye predicting the collapse of the Iron Bank, and hidden Stark healing factor that explains Jon’s resurrection. Call me crazy… crazy like [Myrddin predicting the origin of Hodor in 2008](http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/26325-what-does-hodor-mean/&page=2#comment-1236249).

347,bkmld2,[Spoilers] Why the dothraki attack wasn't stupid.,"Traditionally, when you have cavalry, and your enemy doesn't they would send in the cavalry to begin with. The opposition would have little, to no defense against this. The horses running at full speed would just mow people down if they didn't move, and it gave the rider a chance to slash enemies well they were relatively defenseless. They would make it all the way through the enemy's line, and then loop back around. They would realign, and could do this many times, essentially wiping out the opposition with just this tactic. This was why pole arms were invented. You could stick the cavalier with the end of the long pole as they ran at you. As far as they knew, the white walkers would be defenseless against this attack. The darkness made it so they couldn't see what the white walkers were doing or how they aligned. Then they cut to showing all of the flames being extinguished. Then once the hoard of white walkers are revealed in the light you can see they have formed a wave. Most people might have just saw this as a cool effect, but it is much more significant then that. It was a strategical move by the night king to get higher over the cavalry, thus, rendering them ineffective. This is what cavalry are used for. The advantage of being on horseback is significantly diminished when you're stationary. There would be almost no point to being on horseback if their plan was to just let the hoard get to them before fighting, rather then utilizing the strength of the cavalry.",35,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bkmld2/spoilers_why_the_dothraki_attack_wasnt_stupid/,2019-05-04 20:00:30

350,2658ax,[Theory][Spoilers All] A theory about Jon Snows parentage.,"This is just a theory I thought of recently and was curious what other people thought of it or if other people already had this idea. I have only watched the show and just am halfway done AGOT, and also read some threads on this sub but no major spoilers.

 Basically I think Jon isn't actually Neds bastard but is actually the son of Neds sister Lyanna. And the father could possibly be a Targaryan and Ned knew but was hiding it so he wouldn't be murdered with the rest of the Targaryans. Which also could be what Lyanna meant when she was dying in Neds arms and said ""promise me"" implying for Ned to take care of Jon.

Im curious what other people think or if anyone can prove this wrong, or have any more evidence to support it.

A handful of Scorpions go three for three shots on one dragon and then literally dozens of the things can’t hit another dragon even once. Dany didn’t even need to bring an army, just Drogon is apparently more than enough 

The golden company, 20,000 men I saw Maybe a couple hundred, why hype them up as a game changer for 2 seasons if they are literally useless

The whole discussion about killing innocents was all depending on the idea that Dany would have to burn kings landing to get it. She had already won! No scorpions left and nothing to stop her from killing Cersei and taking over the 7 kingdoms. I don’t care if she goes mad, that doesn’t make her stupid, who is she going to rule if she kills them all.

355,cg0glr,[SPOILERS] I’m a GoT newcomer and didn’t have any issues with Season 8. Why?,"Edit: bring on the downvotes! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

My wife and I started the show from the very beginning about a month ago and just finished it last night. After hearing all the ire for the season, I am now even more flummoxed by it after having watched all the episodes. 

Looking at many threads on here to try and make sense of it all, the general consensus seems to be, “it didn’t end the way I expected it to end, therefore it sucks.” Also, “All the closing character arcs were not laid out like breadcrumbs across seasons, therefore, it sucks.”

Coming into the entire show fresh, I feel like I can look at it more objectively and say that nearly all of the criticisms are subjective **SPOILERS**:

-	Daenerys’ arc? She’s had an evil streak in her ever since she stepped out of the pyre. She’s like Anakin Skywalker, trying to appease the rage inside her as much as possible before she is ultimately triggered. Cersei just woke a sleeping giant.
-	Brandon Stark as king? Why not? Sure he said he didn’t want the crown earlier, but guess what? He’s the three-eyed raven and he understands that he is the last, best, only choice for sensible rule, so he accepts his fate.
-	The Battle for Winterfell too short? That’s like wanting the Battle of Helm’s Deep to go on for months. War with the Whitewalkers is clearly not a slow, turgid affair. It’s an apocalypse and it needed to end immediately.
-	Arya killing the Night King? Why not? She’s a badass and this isn’t Star Wars, where the two big adversaries go toe-to-toe. Jon Snow has always been in over his head and it’s not the Night King’s style to get his hands dirty in war, as we’ve seen throughout the series.

Basically, I don’t get the hate. None of this stuff bothers me. If I had to find something to criticize, perhaps season 8 could have been doled out over 2-3 years to match the pace of earlier seasons, and perhaps Jon Snow’s real bloodline didn’t amount to shit, but these are not things that make me want to put someone’s head on a pike. Both The Long Night and The Bells were some of the most incredibly executed pieces of serialized television I’ve ever seen and to stomp on those achievements is unfair.

Then again, I don’t have 10 years invested in this show- only about a month. So maybe that plays a large part in my approach to watching season 8?",58,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/cg0glr/spoilers_im_a_got_newcomer_and_didnt_have_any/,2019-07-21 19:53:15

358,6udyr8,[Everything] Jon Snow has no talents other than being a nice guy and will therefore die to end the central conflict.,"I like Jon Snow. He's honorable like his ""father,"" Ned. He's selfless, and routinely puts other people before himself to advance some greater good. But after the Night King and undead army are vanquished, what role could he possibly play? Despite being Secret Chosen One and Supreme Nice Guy, how could he have a real career after saving the world from white walkers? Let's be real, he's not a great military tactician. Foolhardy, even! The Battle of The Bastards is good evidence of that. He's a MERELY competent swordsman, not standing out one way or another. He's not particularly bright. His kingness is more out of necessity and happenstance rather than any particular affinity for leadership. His diplomatic skills are naive and likely to get him dead for good next time. So, other than uniting enemies against a common foe, what could he do in the post white walker world? Even once he's outed as Targaryen Jesus there are much more qualified people to sit on the iron throne. He probably wouldn't even want to rule! And if he serves another, who in the right mind would pick him over another capable individual for a job like Hand of the King, Master of Coin, Army General, etc.? I think Jon Snow's conspicuous lack of practical talent is evidence that he's a living plot enabler who facilitates important events moving around him. He's like an ethereal, benevolent force of nature rather than a denizen of Westeros. As such, once the central conflict (Men vs. Zombies) is gone, there won't be a place for him, other than stay-at-home dad or bureaucrat who was known for doing something important once. So, to prevent this nice guy of nice guys from having an epilogue of mediocrity, the story will sacrifice him to save the world. Deus ex Jondeath. 
TLDR: Jon Snow is a really nice guy but has no other distinguishing, practical talents to be of use once the white walkers are gone. He will become a martyr because he isn't written to be good for anything else. 
TLDRDR: GoT will pull a ""There must always be a Night King,"" a la World of Warcraft and Jon Snow will step up and control the legions of undead. ",83,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6udyr8/everything_jon_snow_has_no_talents_other_than/,2017-08-18 03:31:49

361,37p4gz,[S4][Theory] Tywin never wanted to kill Tyrion,"So, Tywin hates Tyrion, and often wished his death, but if there's one thing about Tywin's character it's that he never ever put his selfish goals before his duty, and in his eyes, his duty is to protect his family and his legacy.

And even if Tywin doesn't like it, Tyrion is part of his family, and part of his legacy. When Tyrion is captured by Catelyn, Tywin starts a war to get him back. Then, when it becomes clear that Jaime will probably dies at the hands of the northmen, he tries to transform Tyrion into a good heir : he names him hand of the king, then master of coins, and then marries him to one of the most beautiful and (potentialy) powerful women in the seven kingdoms : Sansa.

So even if Tywin despises Tyrion, he still put his duty before his personnal interests and even slowlu accept that Tyrion will be his legacy. But then Jaime comes back and Tywin can finally get rid of Tyrion, right ? Well, no, as I said, Tywin would never risk losing a member of his family just because he hates him, and he has a lot of important things to worry about as the hand, so why would he take time and efforts to get Tyrion killed ? 

My theory is that Tywin never wanted Tyrion to die, Tyrion's trial was all part of his plan to have Jaime leave the Kingsguard and become heir to Casterly Rock. Then of course Tyrion messes his father's plans by demanding a trial by combat, and Tywin sees no reason to save him, but he never actually schemed to kill him.",43,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/37p4gz/s4theory_tywin_never_wanted_to_kill_tyrion/,2015-05-29 12:09:00

There is not a single person watching who thought they were gonna die... since we KNEW Dany was coming! It took all the tension out of the entire fight. Saved literally the exact same way that it was with season five in the fighting pit. A complete copy of that scene.
- And why did Jon not just get on the dragon? Why did he keep fighting? Where was the third dragon? Why couldn't he help Jon? Why didn’t the Night King kill Drogon? Why didn’t Dany use Drogon to kill the Night King? No one was making sense. Nothing made sense at all.
- I haven't minded the time lapses this season, but this was just beyond laughable. Awful. Truly awful. There’s no way to defend that and no way to make it make sense. Jon might as well have sent a text message to Dany.
- How many more times can the Hound say ""Fuck"" and ""Cunt"" and expect us to laugh at it? Horrible dialogue with Arya too. This is the first time I thought Maisie Williams kinda sucked. It was just so mechanical, going through the motions. It's like she knows the writing is bad.
- Arya was being such a bitch to Sansa. Arya trying to guilt Sansa about something she was forced to do as a child to stay alive. This is coming from the same girl that SERVED TYWIN LANNISTER HIS WINE AND FOOD!!!

I have defended this show for a long time. I still love it, I enjoyed the episode... but the writing is horrendous.

All that being said... seeing that dragon open his eye at the end may have made the whole thing worthwhile, because that was insanely badass.",37,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6v0crh/s7e6_it_was_an_awesome_episode_but_the_writing/,2017-08-21 07:24:52

378,boozw5,"[No Spoilers] Ahead of the series' finale, I'd like to thank Dan and Dave.","As I'm sure most know, back in 2005, Dan and Dave pitched to GRRM their idea for a TV series based off his books, which they were huge fans of. Two inexperienced screenwriters/showrunners were given permission to create a TV series about ASOIAF, which was widely thought impossible, especially at the time. They pitched their idea to HBO, and after a failed initial pilot, things weren't really looking that great. Now, in 2019, we have one of the greatest TV shows ever. It's not perfect, as we've all seen these past couple seasons, but I don't fault them for that. These were 2 mega-fans of a book series with a TV dream, and they fuckin did it. I will not fault them for failing to write on par with GRRM. GRRM is one of the greatest fantasy authors this world has ever seen, expecting D&D to rise to that level is completely unfair. This was their first major project, and they were essentially rookies. Would you expect a rookie to come in and play at the same level as Tom Brady? Probably not. Dan and Dave don't ""suck"", they're not ""idiots"", and they didn't ""ruin the series."" You did that to yourselves by expecting them to be GRRM. Without Dan and Dave, HBO's 'Game Of Thrones' probably would have never existed. We wouldn't have had 10 years of watching characters grow, learn, love, hate, and die. We wouldn't have had the incredible battles and beautiful shots. We wouldn't have had the chance to theorize and criticize. Without Dan and Dave, we wouldn't have had Game Of Thrones to begin with. So before the series wraps up on Sunday, I'd like to say this to Dan and Dave:

David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, thank you. Thank you for not giving up. Thank you for bringing this incredible world to our TV screens. Thank you for showing us things we haven't seen anywhere else. Thank you for the gripping battles and the shocking deaths. Thank you for doing your best when you were out of source material. Thank you for 14 years of hard work and dedication.

Thank you for Game of Thrones.

384,alu7w5,[SPOILERS] Foreshadowing of Jon and Sansa romance and marriage...,"The romance and future marriage between Jon Snow and Sansa Stark has been foreshadowed pretty much since book 1.

&nbsp;

* **YOU WILL MARRY A KING……**

&nbsp;

>“You,” Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, “will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.” Arya screwed up her face. **""No,"" she said, ""that's Sansa.""** 

>(Eddard V- A Game of Thrones)

&nbsp;

For me this quote is one of the most important quotes from the entire series because it pretty much sets up for the audience both Sansa and Arya story arc. Sansa will be the sister who will marry and have children and fulfill her childhood dreams of a happy family, which is why Love, marriage and children will be a constant theme in Sansa’s arc story. She will be treated as an object, passed around by the powerful players of the story, all interested in her claim of Winterfell and the North; she will be forced into marriage alliances and her future children will be desired for their claim in the North. Sansa will try to survive as much as she can, keeping still a slim hope to find love and happiness and maybe one day fulfill that sweet dream of a rebuilding her destroyed family.

Arya will follow another path; she will be a warrior and ruler on her own. Arya always wanted to be the keeper of her own holdfast, she wanted to be a knight and fight in battle and most important, I believe Arya wanted to feel the independence that most women in Westeros could never feel. Not that love and marriage is not impossible for her, but I feel George wants Arya to be a Queen regent on her own.

George is trying to tells us in this passage of the books that women should be able to choose their own paths and if its love, marriage and children what they wish for they should have it, but if its not, they should be free to figure out her own destiny. The tragedy of Lyanna Stark was that she never had a choice and was forced into marry someone she never cared for, and I believe George wants to show with both Sansa and Arya that girls should be free to choose their own dreams., because BOTH dreams are equality valid. 

&nbsp;

* **A CLOAK STAINED IN FIRE AND BLOOD……..**

>When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. **She found his cloak on the floor**, twisted up tight, **the white wool stained with blood and fire.** The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering.

>(A Clash of Kings - Sansa VII)

&nbsp;

Sansa cloaked herself with a cloak stained in ""Fire and Blood"" the words of House Targaryen. For me this has always been one of the biggest foreshadows on the book and its interesting to notice how George used the character of Sandor Cleagane as a redherring for this scene in order to not make so obvious the connection with Jon.

It was only when tumblr user occupyvenus made the connection of this particular scene with one that happened a few chapters before In the book A CLASH OF KINGS that it became pretty obvious this quote was about Jon Snow.

&nbsp;


>“I’ve never lain with any woman but Cersei. In my own way, I’ve been truer than your Ned ever was. Poor old dead Ned. So who has shit for honor now, I ask you? **What was the name of that bastard he fathered?”**

>Catelyn took a step backwards. **“Brienne.”**

>**“No, that wasn’t it.”** Jaime Lannister upended the flagon. A trickled ran down onto his face, bright as blood. “**Snow**, that was the one. **Such a white name** … **like the pretty cloaks** they give us in the Kingsguard when we swear our pretty oaths.”

>A Clash of Kings - Catelyn VII

&nbsp;

>When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. **She found his cloak on the floor,** twisted up tight, **the white wool stained with blood and fire.** The sky outside was darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. She shook out the torn cloak and huddled beneath it on the floor, shivering. 

>A Clash of Kings - Sansa VII

&nbsp;
____________________________________________

&nbsp;


* **THE ORDER OF THE CHAPTERS OF THE BOOKS…….**

&nbsp;

* In the first book A GAME OF THRONES, chapter 4 Eddard I, we have King Robert arriving at Winterfell and asking to visit Lyanna tomb in the crypts of the castle. While there King Robert decides to ask for Sansa’s hand in marriage for his son prince Joffrey. This is the chapter where Sansa and Joffrey become officially betrothed to each other and their Royal engagement its made official. The very next chapter? **JON**. This is also the chapter where Jon Snow will get drunk in the Feats for the king and ask uncle Ben to join the NightsWatch. 

&nbsp;


* In a CLASH OF KINGS chapter 52, SANSA IV, Sansa will get her period and be finally “fit to bear children to the king”. Cersei then tries, as best as she can, to be a mother figure to Sansa in this very special moment and gives her a womanly advice. She tells her that love is a dangerous feeling that makes us all weaker and it should wiser for her to love only her children. Once again we have a chapter discussing Sansa future marriage to a king and the following chapter is **JON VII.**

&nbsp;



* Finally on A STORM OF SWORDS, we have the famous chapter 68, Sansa VI, where she laments that no one will ever marry her for love, its only her name and Winterfell they all want.  The very next chapter of the book? **JON**. Again, thats not a coincidence, George does this, he said that he takes a lot of planning and caring about the way he writes and structures his books.

&nbsp;
______________________________________________-

&nbsp;

* **THEIR ROMANCE HAS ALSO BEEN VERY CAREFULLY FORESHADOWED BUT IN A VERY HIDDEN WAY. WHICH MAKES EVEN MORE INTERESTING FOR ME……**


**A CLASH OF KINGS – THE WINTER ROSE**

In A CLASH OF KINGS we will have George very quietly making the connection with Jon, Sansa and the tale of Bael the Bard.  While was I re reading the books I noticed that George was playing with the chapters orders and trying to tells us some hints of the story by putting characters chpaters next to each other. The first time Jon meets Ygritte on “A CLASH OF KINGS”, chapter 51, she tells him a story of Bael the Bard and the Blue Winter Rose:

&nbsp;


>""The Stark in Winterfell wanted Bael's head, but never could take him, and the taste o' failure galled him. One day in his bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak. When word o' that got back, Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson. So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and walked into Winterfell one winter's night with harp in hand, naming himself Sygerrik of Skagos. Sygerrik means 'deceiver' in the Old Tongue, that the First Men spoke, and the giants still speak.

>""North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark's own table, and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone. The old songs he played, and new ones he'd made himself, and he played and sang so well that when he was done, the lord offered to let him name his own reward. **'All I ask is a flower,' Bael answered, 'the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o' Winterfell.'**

>""Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so rare nor precious. **So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most beautiful o' the winter roses be plucked for the singer's payment.** And so it was done. But when morning come, the singer had vanished . . . and so had Lord Brandon's maiden daughter. **Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow where her head had lain.""**

>(A Clash of Kings – Jon VI)

&nbsp;

Right next in the following chapter 52, Sansa has her first flowering. This is the chapter where Sansa gets her first period and its now **“fit to bear children to the King.”**

&nbsp;



>""The blood is the seal of your womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. You've had your first flowering, no more."" Sansa had never felt less flowery. ""My lady mother told me, but I... I thought it would be different.""""Different how?""""I don't know. Less... less messy, and more magical.” Queen Cersei laughed. ""Wait until you birth a child, Sansa. A woman's life is nine parts mess to one part magic, you'll learn that soon enough... and the parts that look like magic often turn out to be messiest of all."" She took a sip of milk. ""So now you are a woman. Do you have the least idea of what that means?"" ""It means that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,"" said Sansa, ""and to bear children for the king."" …….
Do you want to be loved, Sansa?"" ""Everyone wants to be loved."" ""I see flowering hasn't made you any brighter,"" said Cersei. ""Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.""

>(A Clash of Kings – Sansa IV)

&nbsp;


After getting her period for the first time and be finally ready to bear children for the king, Sansa is taken to see Cersei (on chapter 52) who uses the moment to give Sansa womanly advice about love. She warns her that she will probably never receive the love and attention from Joffrey, that she used to dream of.  She warns Sansa that love is dangerous and make us weaker. The following chapter of the book is **JON VII.**

&nbsp;

>“Robert wanted to be loved. My brother Tyrion has the same disease. Do you want to be loved, Sansa?” “Everyone wants to be loved.” **“I see flowering hasn’t made you any brighter,”** said Cersei. “Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. Love is poison. A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.”

>(A Clash of Kings – Sansa IV)

&nbsp;

In the end of chapter Cersei warns Sansa about love and how dangerous it can be. The following chapter of the book is also **JON VII**. George really wanted us to picture Jon, Sansa and the Blue Winter Rose tale all together. For me this is one of the biggest clues that not only Jon and Sansa will marry but also, its their child that will continue House Stark.

&nbsp;
_________________________________

&nbsp;

* **A STORM OF SWORDS – THE FALLING SNOW**

&nbsp;

In A storm of Swords, George used the prologue of the book to foreshadow Jon and Sansa romance, using the snow to symbolize Jon Snow. In the two paragraphs under, Chett will lament that heavy snow has ruined his plans for desertion and that Jon Snow and Sam stole his comfortable position as Maester Aemon’s steward: and that Jon Snow stole his position.

>“He could feel tears freezing to his cheeks. It isn’t fair, he wanted to scream. **Snow would ruin everything he’d worked for, all his careful plans.** It was a heavy fall, thick white flakes coming down all about him. How would they find their food caches in the snow, or the game trail they meant to follow east? They won’t need Dywen nor Bannen to hunt us down neither, not if we’re tracking through fresh snow. And snow hid the shape of the ground, especially by night. A horse could stumble over a root, break a leg on a stone. We’re done, he realized. Done before we began. We’re lost. There’d be no lord’s life for the leechman’s son, no keep to call his own, no wives nor crowns. Only a wildling’s sword in his belly, and then an unmarked grave. **The snow’s taken it all from me … the bloody snow …”**

>**“Snow had ruined him once before. Snow and his pet pig.”**

>(ASOS Prologue)

&nbsp;

And later we have Jon Snow introduced as as “the snow of winterfell”……

>“The singer rose to his feet. ""I’m Mance Rayder,” he said as he put aside the lute. “And you are Ned Stark’s bastard, **the Snow of Winterfell.”**
>( A Storm of Swords – Jon I)


&nbsp;


Then comes Sansa’s chapter at the end of the book, where she will feel snow falling down her lips and touching her almost like a lover……..

&nbsp;

>Snow was falling on the Eyrie.


>Yet she stepped out all the same. Her boots tore ankle-deep holes into the smooth white surface of the snow, yet made no sound. Sansa drifted past frosted shrubs and thin dark trees, and wondered if she were still dreaming. Drifting snowflakes brushed her face as light as lover’s kisses, and melted on her cheeks. At the center of the garden, beside the statue of the weeping woman that lay broken and half-buried on the ground, she turned her face up to the sky and closed her eyes. **She could feel the snow on her lashes, taste it on her lips. It was the taste of Winterfell. The taste of innocence. The taste of dreams.**

>(A Storm of Swords - Sansa VIII)


This last paragraph is very dear to my heart. How George foreshadows Jon and Sansa first kiss its one of the sweetest parts of the books. 

&nbsp;

_______________________________________

&nbsp;

* **IN A FEAST FOR CROWS – SANSA’S FIRST LOVE**

In A FEAST FOR CROWS, chapter 23, we have Sansa playing the role of Alayne Stone, Littlefinger bastard daughter. In this chapter Sansa remembers Lord Yohn Royce son,  Ser Wayman Royce and how she fell madly in love with him when he visited Winterfell on his way to take the black on the Nights Watch. If we go back to the prologue of the first book, we will find out that surprising, Ser Waymar physical description is identical of Jon Snow. George is trying to tell us that Sansa will probably be physical attracted to Jon Snow once she is reunited with him later in the story.  (randomtvramblings was the first to notice this detail).

>""Bronze Yohn knows me,"" she reminded him. ""He was a guest at Winterfell when his son rode north to take the black."" **She had fallen wildly in love with Ser Waymar, she remembered dimly, but that was a lifetime ago, when she was a stupid little girl.** ""And that was not the only time. Lord Royce saw . . . he saw Sansa Stark again at King's Landing, during the Hand's tourney.""

> A FEAST FOR CROWS,  Alayne I


&nbsp;


In the A GAME OF THRONES prologue, Waymar Royce is described as follows:

&nbsp;


>Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, **grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife**. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. 

>A GAME OF THRONES, Prologue

&nbsp;

Notice how similar this description is to Jon:

&nbsp;

>**Jon’s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black**, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. **Jon was slender** where Robb was muscular, **dark** where Robb was fair, **graceful and quick** where his half brother was strong and fast.

>A GAME OF THRONES, Bran I

&nbsp;


Jon Snow and Ser Waymar Royce are very similar phisically, and Waymar was the first crush of Sansa. I believe George was trying to tells us that Sansa will be attracted to Jon Snow once they are reunited on Castle Black..

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


* **JON SNOW BECOMING THE HERO OF SANSA’S DREAMS…..**


>“Sweet one,” her father said gently, “listen to me. When you’re old enough, I will make you a match with a high lord who’s worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong. This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake. **That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.”** 

>( A Game of Thrones – Sansa III)
 
........

>She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, **for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard.** 

>(A Clash of Kings – Sansa IV)
 
..........

>They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes. “I’m Prince Aemon the Dragonknight,” Jon would call out, and Robb would shout back, “Well, I’m Florian the Fool.” Or Robb would say, “I’m the Young Dragon,” and Jon would reply, **“I’m Ser Ryam Redwyne.”** 

A Storm of Swords – Jon II

Notice how Sansa's heros match with with the ones Jon's used to pretend to be as a child. 

&nbsp;


>“Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, **wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head.**

>A game of Thrones – Sansa VI 

&nbsp;


>""I will not hang him,"" said Jon. ""Bring him here."" ""Oh, Seven save us,"" he heard Bowen Marsh cry out. The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, **""Edd, fetch me a block,""** and unsheathed Longclaw. 

>A dance of Dragons – Jon II

&nbsp;

_____________________________________

&nbsp;

* **AND FINALLY, THEIR DREAMS COMPLETING EACH OTHER’S…….**

&nbsp;

One of the sweetest things about the tale of ASOAIF, it’s the realization that Jon and Sansa are having the same dreams about their future, without each other knowing about it. They dream of peace, going back to home and rebuilding their ancestral home; they dream about marriage and having children named by the brothers they lost in the war; they want to rebuild the family they believe its gone for ever…..

&nbsp;


>“She pictured the two of them sitting together in a garden with puppies in their laps, or listening to a singer strum upon a lute while they floated down the Mander on a pleasure barge. **""If I give him Sons, he may come to love me.** She would name them Eddard and Brandon and Rickon**, and raise them all to be as Valiant as Ser Loras. And to hate Lannisters, too. In Sansa’s dreams, her children looked just like the brothers she had lost. Sometimes there was even a girl who looked like Arya.” 

>A STORM OF SWORDS, Sansa II

>“I would need to steal her if I wanted her love, **but she might give me children**. I might someday hold a son of my own blood in my arms. A son was something Jon Snow had never dared dream of, since he decide to live his life on the wall. **I could name him Robb”**..-

>A STORM OF SWORDS, Jon XII

&nbsp;

Rebuilding Winterfell……

&nbsp;

>The snow fell and the castle rose. Two walls ankle-high, the inner taller than the outer. Towers and turrets, keeps and stairs, a round kitchen, a square armory, the stables along the inside of the west wall. It was only a castle when she began, **but before very long Sansa knew it was Winterfell.**

>A Storm of Swords - Sansa VII

>**Winterfell, he thought.** Theon left it burned and broken, **but I could restore it. Surely his father would have wanted that, and Robb as well**. They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins.

>A Storm of Swords - Jon XII

&nbsp;

So, yeahh, I dont understand when people keep telling me there is no foreshadowing of this romance in the books, when in my opnion, its one of the most foreshadowed matches in the entire novel. 


BTW, they are no only foreshadowed to be in a romance, but also, to be the final King and Queen of this story.................

&nbsp;

______________________________

* **JON AS A KING**

Jon Snow foreshadowing as the final King is found pretty much on every single book from the series. 

&nbsp;


>**""Kings are a rare sight in the north.""**

>Robert snorted. ""More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!""

Eddard  - AGOT


&nbsp;


>**""King,"" croaked the raven.** The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont's shoulder. **""King,"" it said again**, strutting back and forth.

>""He likes that word,"" Jon said, smiling.

>""An easy word to say. An easy word to like.""

>**""King,"" the bird said again.**

>""I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.""

>""The realm has three kings already, and that's two too many for my liking."" Mormont stroked the raven under the beak with a finger, **but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow.**

>It made him feel odd. 

Jon I, ACOK


&nbsp;

>He rose and dressed in darkness, as Mormont's raven muttered across the room. ""Corn,"" the bird said, and, **""King,"" and, ""Snow, Jon Snow, Jon Snow.""** That was queer. The bird had never said his full name before, as best Jon could recall.

>“You,” Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, “will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.” Arya screwed up her face. **""No,"" she said, ""that's Sansa.""**

>""The night’s first traitors,” the queen said, “but not the last, I fear. Have Ser Ilyn see to them, and put their heads on pikes outside the stables as a warning.” As they left, she turned to Sansa. “Another lesson you should learn, if you hope to sit beside my son. Be gentle on a night like this and you’ll have treasons popping up all about you like mushrooms after a hard rain. **The only way to keep your people loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy.”**

>**“I will remember, Your Grace,”** said Sansa, though she had always heard that love was a surer route to the people’s loyalty than fear. **If I am ever a queen, I’ll make them love me.**

>He had another cup of wine as he dressed, then took his wife by the arm and escorted her from the Kitchen Keep to join the river of silk, satin, and velvet flowing toward the throne room. Some guests had gone inside to find their places on the benches. Others were milling in front of the doors, enjoying the unseasonable warmth of the afternoon. **Tyrion led Sansa around the yard, to perform the necessary courtesies.**

>**She is good at this, he thought**, as he watched her tell Lord Gyles that his cough was sounding better, compliment Elinor Tyrell on her gown, and question Jalabhar Xho about wedding customs in the Summer Isles. His cousin Ser Lancel had been brought down by Ser Kevan, the first time he’d left his sickbed since the battle. He looks ghastly. Lancel’s hair had turned white and brittle, and he was thin as a stick. Without his father beside him holding him up, he would surely have collapsed. Yet when Sansa praised his valor and said how good it was to see him getting strong again, both Lancel and Ser Kevan beamed. **She would have made Joffrey a good queen and a better wife if he’d had the sense to love her. He wondered if his nephew was capable of loving anyone.**

>""You would not believe half of what is happening in King’s Landing, sweetling. Cersei stumbles from one idiocy to the next, helped along by her council of the deaf, the dim, and the blind. I always anticipated that she would beggar the realm and destroy herself, but I never expected she would do it quite so fast. It is quite vexing. I had hoped to have four or five quiet years to plant some seeds and allow some fruits to ripen, but now … it is a good thing that I thrive on chaos. **What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three queens, I fear.”**

>**“Three queens?” She did not understand.**

>Nor did Petyr choose to explain. Instead, he smiled and said, “I have brought my sweet girl back a gift.”

As I said before, I believe Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will marry and rule the 7 kingdoms as King and Queen by the end of this story....


TLDR - Jon Snow and Sansa Stark will marry in the final season and rule Westeros as the final King and Queen.

385,6tuufy,"[NO SPOILERS] Unpopular Opinion: The show is finally catering to non-readers, who outnumber readers, and is a better TV show for it","There’s been several post about the pace of this season framing the quick pace as a bad thing, that couldn’t be more incorrect for the majority of viewers.  This is a TV show in its 7th season, that’s extremely long for TV and around the time most shows become unwatchable.  B&W are smart, they know this.  Instead of being yet another show with protracted final seasons that test the patience of fans they’re going all out.  And based on reactions around the net show fans are enjoying it.  

I get that some scenes can be drawn out, but at this point we’ve lived with these characters for several years.  We know their motivations, what makes them tic, why show this yet again?   The car is already moving, no sense in hitting the brakes.  I’m glad they’re attempting to go out with people more enthusiastic now than ever.  They’re not neglecting story with the pace, they’re neglecting minutiae.  For all the suggestions I’ve seen they could add I haven’t seen any they should, save for Bran ex machina, and they’re clearly holding that back for a specific reason.  We’ve gotten multiple battles, a combination of characters meeting that have been years in the making, great scenes for actors to show their range and huge huge reveals, I’d argue this has been the best season yet from a purely TV show perspective.

392,bvw4el,"[Spoilers] Binged the show in a week and a half, some thoughts","Important disclaimer, I already watched the first 3 seasons as they came out, then decided to stop and wait for the whole thing to be available, and in the meantime I picked up a LOT of spoilers (mostly I just knew the fate of almost all the characters in the show, but I didn't know when a particular death or event would happen or how.) I feel like knowing these things impacted my experience of the later seasons positively.

First of all, I think the whole show is enjoyable from beginning to (almost) end and worth watching. I think there's a clear change for the worse in the quality of writing starting with season 5, and there's another dip on top of that with season 7, as the show stopped favoring interesting dialogues and started focusing more on the story and on big spectacles. It's unfortunate, but I didn't mind that personally.

Regarding season 8, I would both agree and disagree with people who hated it.

I think the quality of the writing, which everyone hates, actually rebounded to former glory (in part). Having watched the whole show in such a small time frame makes everything a little blurry, but I clearly remember the first few seasons being extremely quotable (about once or twice per episode there would be a line that gave me a rush.) With season 5 and 6 these great quotes happened much more rarely, like once every four or five episodes, and I don't really remember much of interest from season 7 off the top of my head, but the first three episodes of season 8 hit me like a truck. It felt like prime Game of Thrones.

I think the first three episodes were handled perfectly (except The Long Night in terms of cinematography which was fairly stupid; specifically, I mean the choice of putting everyone in a 1v50 and then making them all survive when they could have just as easily filmed it so that every character had an escape route that would make it at least somewhat plausible for them to survive any of the scenes they were in, but they didn't do that, so what can you do.) The fourth episode is still pretty good, I thought the aftermath of the battle was very pleasant to watch, although I disliked most of what came afterwards (Sansa scheming, the fact they cut her and Arya's reaction to Jon's news about his identity, etc.) I do agree with people who hated the last season when it comes to the last two episodes though, where both the writing and the events that happened left me quite perplexed. Visually speaking 'The Bells' is one of the best episodes in the series, but I think that they didn't have anywhere near enough time to develop that arc, and so they should have written a different ending for Dany that would diverge from the books (this is coming from someone who disliked her character from the very start back in season 1; I didn't mind that she didn't win, but nuking a city just cause of this 'Targaryen madness' as they call it wasn't a good idea and felt almost non-canon in a way.)

Regarding common complaints I see online about the season:

-Leaving just one episode for the Night King's defeat certainly isn't ideal, but I didn't mind it. If you choose to do a 6-episode season then it makes sense to do it that way, and in terms of story it also makes sense to have the dead lose there. There's enough of the dead to make defending Winterfell impossible but it's still a possibility to get to the Night King before he wipes everyone out, and we're at the point where, considering how the army of the dead works, they would gain too many men from killing everyone in Winterfell, meaning that it truly is a last stand. If the dead win, they get two more dragons and almost double their army, making it so that Westeros would have to fall without a doubt. It makes no sense to have the main characters lose at Winterfell and then win elsewhere, and there isn't enough space in the season to let that storyline breathe the way it should, so I feel like the disappointment that came with the episode was a bit disingenuous. People should have expected a one-off, and as one-offs go, this is one of the better ones in my book. I also agree with the director that it wasn't too dark, it's only dark if you watch it in low definition, but as someone who watched it the way it should be, I had no issues whatsoever.

-Arya killing the Night King instead of Jon. This complaint I just don't agree with at all. First of all, even though there's a lot of things that don't make too much sense in the later seasons, that doesn't mean that we can just add another one to the pile because it's 'supposed to be him'. That battle is the most excruciating one yet, and by far the most confusing, what are the chances it's Jon the one that gets to inflict the final blow? Literally anyone could have done it and it would have been fine from a storytelling point of view. Everyone is chipping in and giving their life for that battle. Jon's role, the way I see it, was to bring everyone together and to win Dany's favor so that they would stand a chance against the Night King, which he fulfilled. More importantly, it would have made Arya's little adventure in Bravos meaningless (aside from character development). Everyone's character development plays a role in the story if you think about it: Bran journeys North of the Wall to become the next Three-Eyed Raven, which is supposed to chronicle the history of civilization and makes him the best candidate for leading Westeros into a new era, Sansa suffering as much as she did enabled her to retake the North, Jon's experience North of the Wall also led to the recapture of Winterfell which was essential in order to defeat the Night King, and then there's Arya, whose arc would have had no relevance to the story if her skill, developed thanks to the training she had in Bravos as well as on the way there, wasn't used to kill the Night King. She's the only one who was trained not to be noticed, and I can personally get behind the idea that the best way of killing the Night King is through surprise, more than sheer skill with a blade. The way she kills him, with a trick, makes more sense to me than regular combat. Of course they could have written an epic fight between the Night King and Jon or any knight, but I think that calling Arya jumping out of the shadows 'random' or 'not thought out' is doing the episode a disservice.

-Bran being useless as a character. I'm not the right person to defend this since he's one of my favorite characters, so here's why he wasn't useless: he creeped the fuck out of everyone in the funniest, most exciting way, thus adding value to the show every time he opened his mouth. Him regurgitating stuff that other people had said back to them was either hilarious or epic ('chaos is a ladder', chilling a character who had never lost an argument prior to that moment in the series, letting us see him taken aback for the first time; what he said to Theon during The Long Night; the way he referred to Jaime when waiting for him, etc.); on a more serious note, while it was Dany's arc to break the cycle in Westeros, I feel like he's the perfect person to take on that job. Since he isn't Bran anymore, and since he doesn't feel neither fear nor anger, he truly is a one of a kind, never before seen kind of a ruler. Also being able to, at times, see glimpses of the future must help a lot. It makes sense to me that he would be the King, since before him every one of the kings or queens had severe, human flaws (the Mad King was, well, mad, Robert Baratheon was no king and was only interested in earthly pleasures, Joffrey was a fucking psychopath, Tommen was too naive and good-natured, and Cersei was a vain, self-centered ruler who, as others in the series put it, was nowhere near as intelligent as she believed herself to be.) Bran is completely different in that regard.

-Jaime going back to Cersei makes perfect sense if you binge the show. I'm not going to tell you that him staying at Winterfell with Brienne wouldn't have made sense either, they could have gone either way, but to me it makes more sense seeing him go back to her. Ever since the start if you analyze his character, you can tell that he's never evil, but rather does evil things, and the things he does he only does for her, so essentially he can't break free of her (as he once put it early in the show, 'we don't get to choose who we love'.) He left her because he felt he had to, but couldn't leave her to die alone when he knew they would lose the war and she would die. A bitter ending for a rather bitter story, I personally prefer it to the happy ending with Brienne although, considering the end of season 6 and his reaction to it upon coming back to King's Landing, that wouldn't have been out of character either. Both routes were set up, nothing wrong with going down either of them.

I do agree with complaints for anything that came after episode 4 though. Dany going mad just because she is a Targaryen makes no sense and I feel like that's more obvious if you picture Jon going on just such a frenzy. Instead of her going insane due to her bloodline, she should have just torn down the Red Keep, hence killing quite a few people who were hiding there. It would have made more sense because up until that point she had never really lost anything. Some people rebelled here and there but it was fairly simple to fix that issue, but in Westeros the situation was different. Her dragons, the one thing that makes her holier-than-thou attitude understandable, were dying one after the other. If she lost her last dragon she pretty much would have become just another player in the game of thrones, so now things are for the first time getting serious for her. The more she waits, the more of a risk that her final dragon will be killed, and having Tyrion mess all her strategies and her losing Missandei, it would have made sense that she would be scared and enraged to the point of doing something like that, but destroying the whole city was just stupid in my opinion, and even worse was her justifying it afterwards instead of getting ahold of herself and understanding the terrible mistake she had made, almost as if she wasn't herself for a (rather long) moment. They could still have made her go mini-mad and it would have made perfect sense, but they went down the wrong path in a way that, to me, makes the rest of the show unwatchable.

The way they handled Varys also feels very disrespectful to the audience. I didn't mind personally because they used him so little ever since him and Tyrion got separated in season 5, so I wasn't quite as attached to the character as I was earlier in the series, but it certainly does feel like a bit of a joke, that this master of conspiracy would make such odd blunders.

Also this isn't relevant to discussing the show but I still want to talk favorites. I actually rated every single episode as I watched them; my favorite one was The Watchers on the Wall, followed by Battle of the Bastards and in terms of seasons, I would rate them (going from best to worst) ->6, 1, 4, 8 (if you stop at 8x03), 3, 2, 5, 7, 8 (if you stop at the end).

I think it really helps to enjoy the show if you can keep in mind that as the show went on, priorities shifted from writing (1-4) to story (6), to fan-service and spectacle (7-8). Yes, it could have been the best show ever made, no, it ended up not being that, yes, it could still have been 10 times better, no, it ended up being this instead, but if you want to enjoy it I think you'll find there is a lot to appreciate still.

393,4yp3kz,[EVERYTHING] A rant about the story's direction,"With the release of the finale of Season 6, I began dreading the direction in which the series will be headed. I, along with the majority of you all, are expecting a battle between humanity and the white walkers in Season 7. And while that does seem predictable (which is another aspect I take slight issue with), this plot doesn't fit with the tone, message, and overall basis of the story itself.

George RR Martin fought in the Vietnam War and his novels are very much anti-war. The books made a point of how terrible war was and is in Westeros. From multiple points of view, we see how war is terrible, makes monsters of men, and causes nothing but chaos, fear, and suffering. The siege of Mereen, Robb Stark's campaign, Arya's chapters at Harrenhal, the siege of Riverrun, and even recalls to Robert's Rebellion expand on war and its terrible repercussions upon Westeros and the people. The message of the story is clearly set on revealing that war is terrible and ultimately causes nothing but pain and agony. 

And this is exactly why I am absolutely against the idea of a humanity-white walker war in season 7. The white walkers have been portrayed as this unstoppable unnatural evil force, which is exactly what George RR Martin has stated he actively avoids in writing his novels. He takes criticism with stories like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and all the other blockbusters for having a story that is all about the battle between good and evil. George RR Martin said that he doesn't want any of that and he likes his stories as close to the real world as possible by having complexity within characters.

So why is it that there is an upcoming battle between good men (Jon, Sansa, and loyal bannermen) against evil creatures as the white walkers? This is particularly frustrating because I feel like the show is losing its purpose to audience and I can only hope that this won't be the case for next Season 7. But those are only my thoughts on the issue.

TL;DR: A Song of Ice and Fire is an anti-war story, and with the story headed towards a battle against humanity and the white walkers, it feels as if it contradicts the message ASOIAF held to the audience since the beginning.",30,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/4yp3kz/everything_a_rant_about_the_storys_direction/,2016-08-20 17:45:22

This season has been rushed in general, don't get me wrong. GOT is still the best series but mostly because it had such a strong start. Now they have to finish it, not an easy task without any books to rely on. Too much fanservice in general this season, who died? Not a single good guy. And the demise of Littlefinger was unconvincing and unsatisfying to me, personally. You know things are fanservicy when even fucking Tormund won't bite the dust. Oh, and getting rid of all the smart players like Olena, Littlefinger, with Varys being less of a character than Greyworm, in favor of Mary Sues like Jon, Daenerys and yes, even fucking Hound and Bron.

397,51andi,[EVERYTHING] Faceless Men Theory,"So, as we all know there exists a theory that Syrio Forell is actually Jaqen H'ghar, a.k.a one of the faceless men of Braavos. While this theory is quite based, I believe it can go deeper.

Remember, Syrio was the first sword of Braavos, prior to being brought to king's landing by Eddard to teach Arya how to fight. But if Syrio is, indeed, a faceless man- why would he come? If Ned bought him, why not use him for, say, killing Cersei? The answer is simple:

**Eddard Stark is a faceless man.** He brought Syrio over to train Arya instead of sending her to Braavos, which would be suspicious. But I doubt Arya is the only child he had trained. Remember that one time Robb changed his face to that of his direwolf? Or when Sansa's hair suddenly turned black? Bran turning into Hodor and even Jon's resurrection? **The Stark children (plus Hodor) are ALSO faceless men.**

""But Jon can't be a faceless man!"" I hear you say. ""He is the prince that was promised! Azor Ahai! Alond with Daenerys probably or maybe not idk!"". Well to that I say two things:

A) How can BOTH Jon and Daenerys be Azor Ahai? Clearly **Daenerys Targeryan is a faceless man.**

B) Who's to say Azor Ahai can't also be a faceless man? We'll come back to that one later.

Since we've shifted over to Danny, let's look at her story for a bit. She is one of the faceless man, so **Viserys probably is as well.** They've grown up together in Braavos, after all. Let's look at other characters surrounding her:

The unsullied are trained to be rid of their ""selves"" in a way. **The 8,000 unsullied are all faceless men.** Remember Daario actor change from season 3 to 4? Actor change my ASS! **Daario Naharis is a faceless man.** I won't get into too much detail but just know that **Missandei is a faceless man as well.**

As you can see, **everyone is just a bunch of faceless men.** But how does that affect the prophecy of the prince that was faceless I mean promised? How can all the Jaqens defeat the white faceless SHI-

Well, if everyone is, indeed, the same person, then all sign apply to them equally. Danny's waking of dragons? Danny = Jaqen = Jon. Therefore Jon awakened dragons from stine Q.E.D.

Lastly, let's consider Jaqen as he is described in ACOK: His hair is red on one side and white on the other. For some reason people always consider blue as the color of ice, but ice is more white than anything. Clearly his is a hair of Ice and Fire. But blue is the color of water, so if fire and ice do indeed meet, then there should also be shades of blue, going by this metaphor. Do we know of a character who has red blue AND white as their hair color?

This seems like a stretch but YES. YES WE DO. [It's her.](http://img.cinemablend.com/cb/4/8/0/4/f/9/4804f95181c7410b0955f5ea3a55ce49fb03162f96ed7d856f41c6fd50952c51.jpg)

**Harley Quinn, a.k.a Jaqen H'gar, a.k.a Azor Ahai, the prince that was promised, mother of dragons, king in the north, warden of the east and the west, the three eyed crow, grand maester and lord commander of the night's watch.**",25,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/51andi/everything_faceless_men_theory/,2016-09-05 21:58:01

402,bmvzqk,[SPOILERS] A statistical view of the faux hate and outrage for Season 8.," 

If you're like me, you've spent ages defending Game of Thrones.

How can a TV show about dragons, sex and violence be the best show around?

*'Well because, you never know what's happening, no one is safe'*, etc.

You've also known people who were determined to hate the show, despite never seeing it. Who once, they did see it, couldn't stop watching it, despite their best intention.

You know people like this, I know people like this, we all know people like this.

These are the misers, the Brian's from Family Guy, hipsters and ghouls who hate something purely because it's popular. They love nothing more than to shit on something someone else likes, these are where most of the posts and faux outrage are coming from.

They hate episode 70 and 71 of a 73 episode series so much, that they are going to not watch the final two episodes?

Give me a break, of course they are going to watch them, but it sounds better and cooler to say you aren't though doesn't it? Especially on the unverifiable, braggart filled internet.

Don't worry, I'll back this up with statistics:-

The average rating of Game of Thrones episode on [imdb.com](https://imdb.com/) is 9.0.

The median number of votes is 23,928 (average 33,845, but we'll come to that).

&#x200B;

|Season|Average Episode Rating|Average Episode Votes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Season 1|9.1|24,363|
|Season 2|9.0|21,246|
|Season 3|9.1|25,784|
|Season 4|9.3|29,013|
|Season 5|8.9|28,524|
|Season 6|9.1|54,299|
|Season 7|9.1|37,908|
|Season 8|7.9|80,656|
||||

This season has more people voting than ever, because it's more popular? No, there's do upward trend for the amount of votes.

The only spike we've seen is from Season 6, particularly, the last two episodes, widely regarded as two of the finest to ever grace TV.

In fact, more people voted on those two episodes than the total for any previous season, with the exception of Season 3 (by 5,000 votes), and again that one received a spike from the Red Wedding (another all time great episode).

Season 7 Episode 1 was the lowest rated episode up until this week. How could it possibly top Battle of the Bastards and Winds of Winter?

That garnered an average rating of 8.0.

It tells us that typically, people will go online to talk about an episode if it's great rather than average.

So what about poorer than average?

The answer is no, typically less people voted when the episode was poorer than average? Complacency, indifference, call it whatever you like.

Even Season 5 Episode 6, which showed Sansa's wedding night to Ramsay, a scene which caused outrage, had a less than median number of votes.

I'm going to compare two episodes.

The Door (9.7, voted by 56,246) and Last of The Starks (6.5, voted by 65,478).

More people thought last weeks' was worse than average, than The Door was better than average.

People are suffering from expectancy issues, and are outraging themselves by the show not being as good as they want it to be.

I'm not here saying, it's the best ever season, but I honestly don't know what people were expecting.

This was always coming.

I always thought of these storylines as small streams, that flow very gently.

Well what happens when small, barely moving streams meet one another? They form to make a gushing river.

The speed, the jumps were inevitable.

I won't try and defend some of the non-explanations. I won't call them errors, as they could have easily been explained, and I think are very reminiscent of the pilot episode, in which the creators were so engrossed in their own knowledge of the story, they forgot that we aren't.

It could be better.

It feels worse than it is, because criticism will always be louder than praise.",60,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bmvzqk/spoilers_a_statistical_view_of_the_faux_hate_and/,2019-05-10 13:04:08

408,4npqoa,[Everything] Two ideas/theories which may have already been said. About Ramsay and Night King,"So we know that Ramsay is a lot more a fan of the super old legends and traditions of the Boltons than his more realistic father. Ramsay is into the torture and the flaying and what have you. 

One of the legends of the Boltons states that at one point in history they went so far as to wear the skin of their enemies. What if Ramsay takes this to heart and goes full out by skinning Rickon and wearing his face as a mask. Then he tries to pull a Twenty Goodmen by sneaking into the enemy camp and assassinating either Jon or Sansa, or just somehow during battle winds up in a duel with Jon, and they are totally freaked out by seeing the messed up face/mask of their younger brother coming at them with some blades. The psychological effect could be a huge asset for Ramsay.

On an unrelated note: We know that at one point in the past a Lord Commander of the Night's Watch took a white walker for a bride and ruled over castle black and made sacrifices to the WWs at all that. What if the Night King or some other WW was actually complicit in this and saw it as a sort of alliance by marriage. What if the WW bride was actually like the daughter or relative of the Night King at the time.

We know that the original WW was once a regular adult human, so it makes sense that he would know about kingdoms and houses using marriages to form alliances. 

So when the Wildlings and Northerners stormed Castle Black and killed the Lord Commander and his WW wife, the WW power structure up north found out and got super angry, the same way that Oberyn wanted revenge when they killed his sister.

417,beihgb,[Spoilers] Unpopular opinion :Kit Harrington isn’t that good of an actor.,"I just saw a post about how the scene with Sam and Jon where Sam reveals Jon’s lineage was amazing.  Don’t get me wrong Sam was amazing in the scene, but Jon was all around meh, as he’s been for so much of the series. I don’t know if that’s what the directors are going for in Jon Snow but his acting is extremely bland and emotionless as compared to the rest of cast specifically Sansa, Tyrion, Jaime, Sam and Cersei. These characters play their roles to perfection and never miss a beat. Where Kit tends to juggle between being emotional and being stoic, it’s just so inconsistent. I don’t know if he’s a bad actor per say but compared to his surrounding cast members he comes across as a rather underwhelming actor.",35,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/beihgb/spoilers_unpopular_opinion_kit_harrington_isnt/,2019-04-18 10:53:48

419,6v09ij,[S7E6] This was just bad...,"This was the first episode I can remember that was just plain bad.  There's been annoying and frustrating episodes before but I can't ever remember getting the ""I'm watching the Walking Dead"" vibe from GOT, until tonight. 

The whole plan to steal a wight was dumb enough and it has been discussed in length last week so I don't need to delve into that.  Tonight's episode only solidified how absolutely moronic and poorly thought out this plan was (side note - what was with the random scouting party of wights? the only reason the plan even remotely worked was because they happened to stumble upon a random isolated group).  The only real reason I can think of behind this plan was simply a convenient way to give the writers a wight dragon for the Night King, just some cool fan service that came at the cost of terrible story telling.

One of the best parts about GOT is that it is so unpredictable and anything can happen at anytime, which is why we see the insane amount of theories all around.  Which makes this episode all the more offensive when I was able to see what was coming a mile away.  Oh a giant rock in the middle of a frozen lake, it'll crack and the wights will fall through.  Oh they're trapped now?  Any minute now Dany will come in with her dragons.  Oh Jon's left behind?  Can't wait for Rhaegal to swoop in and pick him up, cementing even further his Targaryen blood... wait, that didn't happen.  Instead that shoehorned Benjen in for no reason other than to give us a recognizable corpse.  

And what is up with Arya?  I've been disliking her more and more (especially during her and Brienne's duel) but this episode took the cake in getting me to hoping that Arya dies soon.  People can come up with reasons why she's acting like she is but all it seems to me is forced conflict between two characters in an unnecessary subplot that I don't care about.  For a show that seems so incessantly focused on racing to the end, they sure seem to enjoy wasting time on a terrible subplot.  Furthermore--this might be most disagreeable for some--while I don't like to critique acting performances, especially of younger cast members, Maisie Williams cannot play the sinister assassin she's meant to be.  Her performance seems so forced and unbelievable to me and it makes me hate the character all the more (but that's just personal, I'm no acting coach).  

Everything in this episode screamed of convenience and fan service.  When Jon called Dany, ""Dany"" it wasn't cute, it has no precedence between those characters and instead it was obviously appealing to the audience that wants to see a relationship form.  The fight scene had no tension because we all knew the dragons were coming.  Jon's ""drowning"" had no tension because we all knew he was going to make it.  The only scene with tension in it was the bedroom scene with Arya and Sansa because Arya has become so psychotic and characterless that I have no idea what her motives or plans are.  

I love GOT and it's still a good show but this was the first episode I have seen that was simply all around bad (well the cinematography was nice).  I hope this isn't a sign of things to come.

Edit:  Criticism doesn't mean that I hate the show.  I still very much enjoy the show and will tune in again next Sunday but I felt this episode was incredibly subpar.  Voicing criticisms and complaints is the only way a show can get better and generate interesting discussions.

436,bdecrl,[SPOILERS] Why I did NOT like this episode," 

It is always everyone's own opinion and you surely may not agree, but I really did not like it and here is why

\- Jaimie manages to reach Winterfell before Night King does ; that is just simply a 'wtf' moment. The guy has to sleep and eat while the walkers don't, and the distance is much, much bigger than from the Wall to Winterfell. Is Night King having vacations on his way down south? Or did he lose the way? Or maybe he likes to let his opponents have an advantage of good dragonglass and to let them meet one another and recall good, ol' times?

\- Similar argument with Tormund; he manages to get back from the Wall to Winterfell after it gets crushed by the dragon, then gets to Last Hearth right after Night King massacres all the people in it and heeey, that is all pretty damn normal, right? Right...?

\- The dragon flight just made this episode sooo family-friendly and cringe... Sansa thinks about how to feed all the people in the army etc while Jon flies a fooking dragon and tries to warm the queen xDDDD

\- So many character encounters felt very 'hey, we dont have much time and we have to show all the things the fans were waiting for' so when Arya meets the Hound again they basically have 2 brief words with one another and that's it. And then on top of it she speaks to her friend Gendry for another minute, does not even explain why she needs this damn weapon (jeeez, it is not a fooking secret, what is wrong with you Arya?!) and then she turns her back and goes away as if she wanted to say 'My screen time has come to an end in this episode, I would like to speak to you a bit more, I really would but I can't so foock you Gendry'

\- Pretty much the same goes to Sam and Daenerys, this whole conversation felt so artifical, quick and pointless... Yes, John Bradley did play it pretty well on his part, but the way the conversation went crazily downhill to the point Dany tells him bout his family she killed was weird and unrealistic

\- Bran sitting in this courtyard for the whole episode is hilarious, anyone's willing to get the cripple to some warmer place??

\- Just as a cherry on the top, Kit Harrington making the same facial expression he always does when his character hears some bad, shocking or just unexpected news when Sam told him about him being a Targaryen just got me sooo badly haha

All in all I am really disappointed by this episode, hoped for more action, finally less inconsistency in the plot etc but we got what we GoT and I hope next week will pleasantly surprise me!

I ask you fellow watchers to share your opinions on these matters if you feel like it :P",56,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bdecrl/spoilers_why_i_did_not_like_this_episode/,2019-04-15 14:21:59
437,bmi2e3,[Spoilers] Anybody else also really disappointed what they did to the Series?,"Is anybody else also quite disappointed by how they changed the characters' personality and attitude in Season 8? This is not simply how Game of Thrones felt like - not at all. I actually got bored watching S08E04. It is also a great shame how they decided to change Daenerys from what she was earlier. How ""easily"" and ""boringly"" they just killed  Rhegal in the most boring and unspectacular way possible. Same goes for Melisandre - I was really shocked about the lack of creativity of the script - it was in fact non-existent. 

&#x200B;

I have to conclude that, unfortunately HBO really seems to have messed up the last Episode. HBO made a fortune with Game of Thrones - they got what they wanted, now it seems like that they are just going to end it in a way which simply does not feel like Game of Thrones at all - it feels more than another Series where lots of money has been invested in, but which lacks genuine writing.

&#x200B;

I am certain that George R.R. Martin is also not happy with how Game of Thrones changed dramatically from his books - I read them all and can just heartily suggest them all to you - you can get the set for $25 on Amazon. The books are far more satisfying than the Series. [Here you can actually compare of how much the Series changed from the Books.](http://got-books-to-series.surge.sh/)

&#x200B;

I really loved the Series until Season 7 actually - the quality started going down slowly, but not very much. Now, it plummeted down suddenly. It has become just another ""hot garbage"".

As a creative person who writes books and short stories of my own, I know how fucking hard it is to write stories, especially planning them out, even the simple ones. 
Benioff and Weiss, at the least, worked with Martin, created, ran, and wrote 4 amazing seasons of a show you claim to love, and at the most, did the same but with 8 seasons. And what do you fans do? Pick them apart, mock them, be spoiled brats who think their endings work better. What the fuck do any of you know about character development? About how it’s “meant” to end? Do you think Martin is not advising them in the ending? He said that all the major character points end the same way as he planned. Do you seriously think you could’ve done better? Because they fucking wrote and ran this show and worked so hard on it. They love the characters, the source material, all of it. Shame on you all.

448,boup4f,[SPOILERS] Dany's character arc makes no sense because it is missing at least 1-2 full season(s) of character building and yes in a story driven series it matters. Fancy actions scenes don't make those things go away,"She started off as a young girl, abused by her brother, brainwashed into believing their birthright was the most important thing to them. She was sold off as a slave to Drogo where she was raped, she was payment for her brother to gain a Dothraki horde, Her brother even says to her he'd allow a thousand men to rape her and their horses if it meant he could take the iron throne back. She was an innocent girl, that was powerless at the time to defend herself and was horribly assaulted because of it.

Fast forward and she uses these experiences to better herself, she herself was effectively a slave to her brother and felt that no one should live a slave in their life. She used the power and influence she managed to gain, that she only gained after years of torture and abuse to make her life about liberation. She was a liberator, not a conqueror. Now you can say those are the same things, it depends which side of the battle you were on, to the slaves she was a savior, to the masters a conqueror. She make s a big speech about breaking the wheel and making the world a better place and most people watching would see her actions as noble and for the betterment of the world. She was an empathic loving person, she was left devastated and distraught when one of her dragons killed a young boy. They were young and she was unable to control them, so she locked them away so that they could not harm another person and who releases the dragons because if you remember it wasn't Dany. (Now we are expected to believe she would turn up at Kings Landing and purposefully destroy and attack children and regular peasants?) 

She is young and naive, she makes mistakes, every single person makes mistakes and this show used to be really good at showing the consequences of these mistakes. The pay off for a build up meant that we could understand better how and why these things happened. She showed a respect for the intelligence and consul of others, taking advice often and not taking the course of action that felt right for her.

When she first arrived she wanted to attack Kings Landing, yet she was talked out of it by her advisers. She wanted to take the throne in one quick seamless attack but because there was a risk to innocents she was talked out of it and it was the risk to innocents why she agreed not to. If she did however, she would have attacked the red keep, killed Cersei immediately and been queen within the hour. She would have had 3 dragons, she wouldn't have given time for KL to set up scorpions or defenses, she would not have had to wipe put the Golden Company, she wouldn't have lost Missandei, she wouldn't have lost her dragonss or suffered nearly as many loses because the advice she was given **and followed** was wrong. Yes she burned the Tarleys and yes she was wrong to do that as well, but again she was trusting in her more mature consul. Olenna Tyrell told her to be a dragon, to be who she is, not to be some weak false leader. Olenna suggested she use power and fear, the idea that might makes right. Dany was taught to use fear to pull people into line behind her and this was war not a time of peace. Yes she should have imprisoned them, showed mercy but she yet again followed advice (or at least her interpreted advice) she was given.

Jon Snow has spent his entire arc brooding and knowing nothing. If he had not insisted on going north of the wall the NK would never have gotten the dragon as a result wouldn't have broken the wall. The AotD would have got to the wall and just been left there staring up for eternity at a monolith they couldn't get past. Jon Snow has merely played the role of providing the NK with the tool needed to break the wall. Ned, the man who protected him since birth did everything to keep him safe, he died for the secret and never uttered a word even to his own wife. Instead he allowed her to believe he was unfaithful and fathered a bastard. Now Jon Snow comes along and decides to defecate all over Ned's sacrifice by telling people. He should never have told Sansa, people paint it as her being littlefinger and creating chaos, but it seemed more to me like a teenage girl unable to keep her mouth shut. Her own father spoke and lived a life where honor was the most important thing yet another Stark decides to shit all over what he spent 15 years trying to prevent. 

Within all of this we are expected to believe that Tyrion who is a very smart person would not see through this charade? Tyrion, Varys and Littlefinger were the 3 most intelligent men in the series yet as soon as the books are surpassed Tyroin becomes braindead, Varys a glorified extra and Littlefinger turns into an even creepier pedophile just less intelligent. Old Littlefinger when Bran uttered the words ""Chaos is a ladder"" to him would have caused him to flee, he showed great surprise at hearing those words yet stuck around to be caught out. Tyrion should have based upon his earlier political knowledge known what Sansa was doing by giving him the information and he should have also been aware how Varys would act yet he seems to be on the path of someone who can't see past the end of his nose anymore.

All of this is just a massive plot contrivance to try and push a certain narrative but it has been done with a sledgehammer, to force it in and it was not left to grow organically. When Alan Rickman was cast as Snape in Harry Potter he was told by JK Rowling right at the very start how the books would end. He was told of the twist so that his earlier season portrayal of the character would make sense at the end. Emilia was not told I would suspect until she was given the script of season 8 how her character would unravel and it shows in every season prior, her delivery of lines and physical acting does not line up. Hell her acting this season has been amazing considering the drastic sharp turn that has happened



Now her eventual decent into anger isn't the issue, it is the monumentally dreadful pacing of it and the way in which it was told. In the way the show presents it, the entire ""madness"" arc is bloody awful, the kind of writing you'd expect in a teen fan fiction. Her turning here made no sense and needed a lot longer to bare the fruit. You can apologize for the poor writing and try to claim it makes sense and if you can mentally gymnastic the events to force it to make sense, fair enough, but looking at the material on show it simply fails to hold up to scrutiny and this is why GoT seasons 7 and mostly 8 are to many people very disappointing. Nothing actually really makes sense. The story is fucked, but at least the special effects are cool right? I mean that is why people bother going to see action movies like Transformers, I mean it certainly isn't for the story",22,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/boup4f/spoilers_danys_character_arc_makes_no_sense/,2019-05-15 11:11:02
449,asgu2f,[SPOILERS]How are people ok with Arya suddenly turning into Batman.,"When did Arya learn to fight to the point that she can best Brienne.
She trained with Syrio for a few weeks at best.
The Hound never taught her how to fight.

And people say Arya beat her because they fought in the dark and Arya learned to fight blind.
All faceless men go through the blindness training. And even the Arya never beat The Waif while blind, she blocked a few strikes at best.

Across five books and seven seasons, Jon's been built up as a shining example of the ""Heroic Bastard"" archetype. So to suddenly reveal he isn't a bastard after all undoes much of his identity and character development. He gradually came to accept his status as a bastard and dedicated himself to showing Westeros - a society with a strong stigma against bastards - that bastards can be good and honorable people. Removing his bastard status feels and contrived and even somewhat insulting against real-life people who are born out of wedlock and looked down on for it.

452,6e0h6u,[S6] Something I noticed about Arya,"I rewatched the episode entitled ""No One"" (S6 E8),and noticed something the first time that I watched this episode. At the end when Arya is running away from the Waif, she is cornered in her little hide away. She then puts out the candle and then kills the Waif. What I saw was that she closes her eyes and makes the room completely dark so that both of them could not really see well. In the beginning of the season, Arya is blind and she is learning how to fight blind. Specifically, she is learning how to fight the Waif blind. The Waif on the other hand is fighting Arya, seeing all of her moves. Arya knows that she is no match for the Waif while both of them can see each other, so what she does is lead the Waif to the hiding place on purpose and cut the candle with Needle creating darkness, She is doing this because Arya learned all of the Waif's moves and learned how to fight her blind. The Waif on the other hand never learned how to fight blind, putting her at the disadvantage in this situation, and ultimately leading to her death.

457,bef0l0,[Spoilers] Am I the only one who who doesn't like Daenerys. Shes super entitled.," 

She gets on my nerves so much, she thinks that the entire world is entitled to belong to her and she should rule it. With no regard to what is fair or just. None of the other characters are like this, even when they could be. Tyrion is technically lord of Casterly Rock (Tywin is dead and Jaime took kingsguard oath) but he doesn't go around ordering everyone around and being a little bitch. A good queen should be fair, just, and put the needs of the people in front of their own. Daenerys was ready to let the white walkers invade the north without helping. Unless she got their oath and got Jon to give up his crown. She is no better than Cersei in that regard. I also don't like how much of a liar she is. A good Queen should have honor and honesty, not lie whenever it suits her and to get her way. An example I think of is when she lied to the original unsullied and told him to give her the army in exchange for a dragon. But as soon as she got the army she had her dragon burn the guy alive. That's the only time I can think of, but I know their have been others. I really think that their are lots of similarities between her and Cersei, except that Cersei understands her role and that she is doing wrong. Daenerys does not seem to understand it. She is the least likely person (in my opinion) that is worthy of ruling the iron throne. Everyone always goes on about how just and fair she is. But she burns everyone who says no to her alive.

Am i the only one who thinks this, everyone else I talk to seems to love her and think shes the best. It has gotten to the point for me that I do not even like the actress who plays her.",92,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bef0l0/spoilers_am_i_the_only_one_who_who_doesnt_like/,2019-04-18 04:11:52

460,bnxvu0,"[SPOILERS] Lol, this season just keeps getting shittier and shittier.","They gave one of the most reviled characters a “happy,” romantic ending — the character that people have patiently been waiting years to see meet the complete opposite.

Tyrion demands to meet privately with a prisoner, then lets that prisoner go, and apparently not one guard bothered to even check on the prisoner once they returned... or apparently at all at any point afterwards? Lol, not one guard even so much as peeped inside the tent, and thought, “Shouldn’t there be someone tied up in here?”

Daenerys somehow couldn’t burn Euron’s ships when it was just a handful of them (leaving them to somehow manage to destroy her fleet and miraculously capture Missandei)... yet she now can somehow destroy his *entire* fleet (all equipped with scorpions, and with plenty of time to prepare their positions), and destroy the entire city (which also happens to be lined with scorpions)?

Jaime is on a mission to find and rescue Cersei (while her city is burning and crumbling), but here’s Euron Greyjoy, so why not just fight with him instead. Then they give Euron (a character I kind of think most people don’t even care enough about to detest) some smiling ending, going off with the thought that he’s the one who killed Jaime Lannister (which he pretty much did, which makes it that much worse).

Jaime fights to what seems like certain doom against the undead alongside pretty much every other army in Westeros *other than* Cersei’s, after which he decides to finally sleep with Brienne, only to suddenly decide afterwards that he’s going to go sneak back to Cersei? I mean, even for Jaime, that battle with the White Walkers kind of seemed like a definitive “Yeah, after what we’ve seen, and after what we just fought off with no help from you, screw Cersei” moment.

I won’t even get into the Night King, or just about every other aspect of the long-awaited battle against the White Walkers, but the list just goes on, and on, and on. It’s like the show runners are intentionally trying to make the final season as terrible as humanly possible.

After Season Seven (in which everything was clearly rushed), my expectations weren’t that high, but this is just a truly depressing way to end such a beloved series.",16,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bnxvu0/spoilers_lol_this_season_just_keeps_getting/,2019-05-13 06:58:11

I don't think either character would KNOWINGLY commit incest because it goes against all of those values we have appreciated watching them cultivate over the past 6 seasons. I also believe it would draw too close of a comparison to the evil characters of the show like Cersei and the mad king. 

So I was looking some genuine opinions from people who want to see this happen about why they want it to happen.

465,3s8s5w,[ALL SPOILERS] [THEORY] Bran Stark is the villain,"A Song of Ice and Fire will end in a battle between the gods of ice and fire.  The ""Red God,"" the Smith, R'hulor, et al., against the ""Other,"" Stranger, Faceless God, et al.

The Fire God has as a champion, obviously, Daenerys Targaryen. 

The Ice God has Bran Stark.

Think about it:  (Excepting Hodor) He is the only character who has always been heading north, pulled by some force beyond the Wall, like Sauron calling Frodo home.  

George R. R. Martin almost named the seventh book ""A Time for Wolves,"" and Sansa, Arya and Bran are all getting cozy with different facets of the same god:  Life is short, make your own justice.  All men must die.

What if GRRM is attempting to tell the Anakin-to-Vader story that George Lucas  mangled? 

Bran is about to be able to look through time at all the injustices his family has suffered:  The executions of his father, his grandfather and his uncle.  He'll see the Red Wedding, Sansa's rape, etc.  What if his mind explodes and all that psychic power bursts out as he swears to make sure Winter Is Coming forever.

Jon Snow is not Ned's bastard son. He is actually the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar. The meaning of Lyanna's last words to Ned (""Promise me"") were for Ned to promise not tell anyone of Jon's true parentage.
I further speculate that Jon is not a bastard at all. Rhaegar and Lyanna were married in their little hideout, making Jon heir to the throne. Ned also knew this, but promised Lyanna to keep it a secret because if word got out that there was a living Targaryen on Westeros Jon certainly would have been killed by either the Baratheons or Lannisters.
The Targaryen dragon has three heads. We know Dany is one of them, I think Jon is the second. No idea as of yet who the third could be.

470,blci1w,[SPOILERS] Is Sansa the Worst?,"Yes. I am now convinced Sansa is the most evil character in the show. She was never a true Stark. She always dreamt of a life in King’s Landing. Originally her dreams were naive and full of hope, but after a life of torment her dreams became much darker. 

Her biggest influence was Littlefinger, who taught her all of his ways to usurp the throne. Her betraying Jon and telling Tyrion about his lineage is “chaos is a ladder” 101. She doesn’t want Jon on the iron throne, she just wants somebody she can control on the iron throne. She wants the power for herself, which is why she refuses to give Dany a shot, despite everything she’s done for them, and Jon’s pleas. 

Sansa claims she doesn’t trust Dany. Why not? Because she sacrificed a dragon to help your cause? Because she loves your brother? Sansa has absolutely no reason not to trust Dany. She just wants the power, and Dany is in her way. Once she got knowledge of information that could move her closer to the iron throne, she used it. She’s a power hungry usurper— a female littlefinger.

As far as how the show will wrap up, we know we’re set up for an epic battle next episode. Based on the Battle of Winterfell, I think it’s safe to assume Cersei will die next episode. That leaves a full episode to determine what happens to Jon and Dany. One or both of them will die because of Sansa. I hope Jon dies protecting Dany, just so Sansa has to live with the fact that she murdered her brother.",57,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/blci1w/spoilers_is_sansa_the_worst/,2019-05-06 17:57:25

491,bdaybh,[SPOILERS] Unpopular Bran Opinion,"Bran/Raven is quickly becoming my least favorite character. He’s supposedly omniscient, but he’s already made some fatal mistakes that are gonna fuck up the season and ruin what little good we had going for us. 
Yes, I know they do that for The Drama, but whatever, I’m still salty. 

Bran and Samwell should NOT have told Jon about his parentage. Hear me out:

If Jon DIDN’T know, Varys/Tyrion/Davos would have urged Daenerys and Jon to wed. The Starks/North and Targaryen houses would have united. Sansa would have been a little bitch about it, the Mormont girl, Lyanna, would have too (I can’t fault her for it, I just love her too much), but ultimately that’s a fairly good move and most likely wouldn’t have caused a feud for the southern throne AND connected the kingdoms again (since Yara pledged already). With minimal drama. 

Yeah, it would be a lil weird that Jon and Dany were shacking up (being nephew/aunt), but ONLY Sam and fucking Bran would have known. Not a big deal. There’s already more ham enough incest in the show, what’s a lil more?

However, now there’s gonna be some major blowout. Samwell put the seed of doubt in Jon’s mind (and now Jon knows about the Tarlys-which wasn’t a great move but, hey, Daenerys didn’t know they were Jon’s best friend’s father and brother!!), Jon’s gonna do something stupid like tell Sansa (who is too much like her mother to NOT do something spectacularly idiotic), Dany and Jon are gonna have a fight about the “true” ruler, there’s gonna be a lot of unnecessary shit- if Bran has just kept his damn mouth shut like a truly omnipresent figure, it all would have been okay. 

Isn’t the trope that the all-knowing character tells too LITTLE and fucks it up? Dammit.

EDIT: I was just introduced to the Bran-is-the-NK conspiracy and now I wanna claw my eyes out and scream. Why are conspiracies so convincing?!?!",57,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bdaybh/spoilers_unpopular_bran_opinion/,2019-04-15 06:35:46
492,85xii5,[SPOILERS] Prove Me Wrong: Jon Snow = Moron,"This tirade pertains exclusively to the events taking place in Seasons 6 and 7. Seasons 1 - 5 Jon Snow was a hella decent character, and that's most likely due to his show material still being drawn from G.R.R.M's writing at that point in time. 


**Claim**: Jon Snow is a moron.


**Reason 1**: Taking into account that Jon Snow had 0 idea Sansa Stark + Petyr Baelish were going to save the day at the Battle of Winterfell, he should have perceived the coming battle as a guaranteed loss; end of story. He simply did not have the numbers (which he himself states). He does offer a bit of reasoning behind his decision to proceed with the battle anyway (""Battles have been won with worse odds."") However, he offers 0 strategies that might compensate for his lower numbers. Contrast this with the Battle of Blackwater Bay where Tyrion, faced with the knowledge that Stannis's forces were enough to take King's Landing, devised the wildfire strategy to at least have a fighting chance. You might think that with insufficient numbers AND a lack of brilliant strategy that Jon Snow would at least heed Sansa's advice to not fall into Ramsay Bolton's traps. However, what happens at the very beginning of the Battle of Winterfell? He falls into Ramsay Bolton's -obvious- trap. 

**Reason 2**: Despite not having anywhere near the numbers needed for a victory at the Battle of Winterfell, Jon Snow goes ""eff it"" and decides to proceed anyway. If the battle had been lost, the results would have been -disastrous- for the houses that decided to remain loyal to the Stark name. Sansa Stark would also be placed in extremely hot water having galloped around the North inciting a rebellion against House Bolton. This extreme lack of care about the fates of these individuals is almost entirely contradictory with the value Jon seems to place on Rickon Stark's life. It's also entirely contradictory with Jon Snow's concern about preparing for the fight against the White Walkers. How does a suicide mission help that cause in any way?


**Reason 3**: Accepts the ""King in the North"" title. After the disastrous and tragic events that followed Robb Stark's crowning as King in the North, Jon Snow should have known better than to hastily accept the same title that inspired jealousy of and betrayal towards House Stark (which culminated in the Red Wedding). Indeed, the vast majority of houses in the North remained obedient to House Bolton until the Battle of Winterfell was won. What on Earth makes it a good idea to call yourself King of all these houses? Is that not  guaranteed to lead to spite and hatred? Why would Jon Snow trust the loyalty of the houses who didn't even support him against House Bolton?

Also, why would Jon Snow accept such a title while Ned Stark's trueborn and capable daughter is sitting right next to him? Jon Snow is characterized as the kind of guy that cares a lot about honor and doing things ""the right way"". Knowing Westeros's culture and extreme bias towards bastards, the most pragmatic thing to do would be to support Sansa Stark as Queen in the North. She has a stronger claim AND Jon Snow knows she's not a moron. This makes sense as Sansa effectively won the Battle of Winterfell and is therefore responsible for the North being liberated from House Bolton. Without Sansa it would've been ez pz for House Bolton to squash Jon. 

**Reason 4**: Jon Snow decides to let the Karstarks and Umbers keep their castles, titles, and lands. The houses that decided to support Jon in the Battle of Winterfell were effectively sacrificing themselves out of loyalty. The odds of winning were absolutely awful and they pressed on anyways. They put their necks out for the Stark family and sent their sons and daughters to violent deaths to honor their oaths. Instead of rewarding these families for their sacrifice and providing an incentive to remain loyal to the Starks, what does Jon Snow do? He  prioritizes the ""unfair fate"" of 2 children (who aren't even being executed) for their family's horrible betrayal. Put yourself in the shoes of the houses who fought for Jon in the Battle of Winterfell. Imagine your sacrifices and bloodshed being completely disregarded even though Jon Snow would have NEVER been King in the North without their assistance. 

In addition to a lack of incentive for loyalty, Jon Snow now establishes the precedent that traitorous houses need not worry about their children when they decide to screw House Stark. Their children pretty much have ""insurance"" which gives would-be traitors an ENORMOUS amount of security. They now know that their children and the future of their house are A-ok regardless of the misdeeds they pull off.

**Reason 5**: Probably the freshest evidence in everyone's memory is how Cersei is literally about to swear to support the fight against the Night King contingent on Jon Snow remaining neutral. Jon Snow's entire character revolves around prioritizing the fight against the Dead. That's literally what his entire arc is about. Jon Snow recognizes that if not everyone cooperates to stop the Dead they are pretty much dead. 

What does Jon Snow do? Swears loyalty to Daenerys Targaryen in Cersei's face. This RUINS the entire point of negotiating with Cersei to begin with. This RUINS Westeros's best chance of surviving the fight against the Dead. Just like other characters say, he could have simply lied and attempted to secure Cersei's assistance. But nope. For some reason he let his loyalty to Daenerys completely outweigh his concern about defeating the Army of the Dead and saving Westeros. (Please don't counter that Cersei was going to dishonor her vow anyway; Jon Snow did not factor that into his decision at all). 


**Conclusion**: I honestly feel that this might all be on purpose. It reminds me of Rhaegar Targaryen (who everyone said was an amaaazing person and ruler omg *fangurl squeal*) who decided to run off into the sunset with Lyanna Stark, screwing over his house and pretty much inciting Robert's Rebellion. It's just displeasing to me how the climax of this story seems to be revolving mostly around Jon Snow/Daenerys Targaryen when one of them is just a ""mad dog without a strategic thought in his head"" and seems to face 0 consequences for his impulsive choices.",53,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/85xii5/spoilers_prove_me_wrong_jon_snow_moron/,2018-03-21 03:31:20

497,3egyv9,[S04E02] (Showerthought) The kindest thing Cersei ever did for Tyrion...,"...was to accuse him of Joffrey's murder.

Cersei (along with the rest of the Lannisters save Jaime) spent Tyrion's entire life excluding him from the family, wishing and actively plotting for his death, pretending he didn't exist. But when Cersei accused Tyrion of regicide, she was putting him right in league with the other siblings. Jaime killed Aerys, and Cersei killed Robert. (and his only trueborn heir) She was thinking, on some unconscious level, that Tyrion must be just like the rest of them, a true Lannister.

Sure, it fucked a lot of things up for Tyrion, but Cersei was only doing it from some dark, depraved place of love.",30,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3egyv9/s04e02_showerthought_the_kindest_thing_cersei/,2015-07-24 22:03:32

499,bdazd8,[spoilers] Dany dislike rant,"ughh i despise daenerys for the sole reason that almost all her conquest were possible b.c of her pretty face and recently all she ever does is scream “i have dragons; i am entitled to the crown bc i’m a targaryen”. in 801, she’s all like i’m the queen yall so follow me and even kind of threatening sansa all bc “she don’t like me”. i, also, dislike the fact that she isn’t very flexible (though at time she does compromise aka cersei conquest) aka “bend the knee” and at times is unreasonably merciless aka the sam’s family and basically burning alive anyone that basically disagrees w. her. 

however, this isn’t to say that yes she’s had her POWER moments and not recognize how she grew stronger from her hardships. i even began watching got was b.c of daenerys and adored for her from s1-3. it’s just throught the recent seasons her character arch has been just all about “I’M THE QUEEN SO BEND” 

ps- sorry if my writing style annoys you and if i kinda of make no sense. also feel free to present your opposing points :)",19,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bdazd8/spoilers_dany_dislike_rant/,2019-04-15 06:38:19
