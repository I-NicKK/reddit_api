38,bqvnol,[Spoilers] Epilogue: After The Wheel,"In the long years of his reign, King Brandon Stark was not loved by the smallfolk nearly so much as the quietude of his rule. Bran himself was a distant and near-silent king, with no taste for great celebrations or inspiring rhetoric. But when the Driftwood Queen demanded the independence of the Iron Islands in 313 AC, Bran granted it almost immediately; the expanded fleet that the Greyjoys had long laboured over had hardly left its harbours before the raven returned from King‚Äôs Landing. Dorne‚Äôs autonomy grew not with violence, but with carefully negotiated partnership, and though now Ornelia Martell is styled the Princess of Dorne, the Maesters of Oldtown would say that the lands beyond the Red Mountains are more closely entwined ‚Äì through trade and goodwill ‚Äì with the Five Kingdoms than ever before. It is said that, though the Seven Kingdoms became Six through the sacrifice of a million lives, the Six became Five without a single drop of spilt blood.

These years of calm saw the turn of seven long summers and seven mild winters. The external threats to Bran‚Äôs reign ‚Äì the Braavosi blockade of 309, sponsored by the Iron Bank and facilitated by many mercenaries; the Second Crossing of the Dothraki Khalasar in 318; the Septons‚Äô Rising of 331 or the coming of the Red Refugees in the decade afterward ‚Äì seemed less desperate in comparison to the crises endured by King‚Äôs Landing in the warlike years before, as if an invisible hand were directing events, by slight nudges, toward the ends of stability and prosperity. Though terrible battles were rumoured in many parts of Essos, their effects were seldom felt in Westeros. One might also have expected some friction to arise from the King‚Äôs worship of the Old Gods, but Bran‚Äôs habits were so private, and his style of rule so tolerant, that for a time it seemed impossible that internal strife and religious discord could ever have been the hallmark of the Six ‚Äì and then the Five ‚Äì Kingdoms.

The absence of vengeful dragons surely helped. There are folk in Volantis who, in exchange for a cup of sweet wine, will tell the tale of their fathers or grandfathers catching sight of a great winged creature that obscured the waning moon in its eastbound flight, high above the city. Some of the Ghiscari traders who can now be so frequently found in Planky Town or Storm's End tell a similar story: that in the cold night after the death of the Dragon Queen, her last child, screaming with anguish, caused many a night-time watcher to return to their decks in great haste. Daenerys was carried far into the east, perhaps as far as the Shadowlands or the unknown forests of Ulthos. What became of her remains is not known. Some say the creature flew until fatigue brought it plummeting into deep, uncharted waters. Others suggest that reports of dragons - fleeting glimpses, disappearing livestock, bone-chilling cries in the lonely places of the world - are not always the product of fancy or hysteria.

Bran outlived every member of his original Small Council, and outlasted ‚Äì as far as can be known for certain ‚Äì every other Stark. Of his sister Arya, the Hero of Winterfell, little was ever heard again: she sailed West, beyond the reckoning and knowledge of all, within days of her brother‚Äôs coronation, leaving only the rumours that are shared and rendered into stories in every town of Westeros and Essos: of a single, ragged-looking Raven that flew out of a storm over the Western Sea decades later and on to the last high tower of the Red Keep, bearing a message whose contents were seen only by the King and his closest advisors. The tale that is most often told is that Arya reached the land that is West of West, and shared what details she could of the wonders and terrors she found there before meeting her own mysterious fate. What is certainly true is that, slowly and deliberately, Bran has been fortifying the Western coast of the Five Kingdoms throughout the latter part of his reign. 

Sansa Stark, the Queen in the North, maintained strong relations with her brother‚Äôs kingdom and toward the end of her life was frequently to be found in the courts of King‚Äôs Landing or Dorne, having inherited from her mother a preference for the warmth. After her passing in 371 her bannermen selected Harrold Royce to rule the North.

Of the fate of Jon Snow ‚Äì the Bastard of Winterfell, the Half-Stark, the Queenslayer, the Resurrected, the Friend of Wolves, twice named Lord Commander of Castle Black ‚Äì very little is known. The Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister, visited the North and the Wall in the first decade after Snow's return to the Night‚Äôs Watch. Of that visit he records that the Wall was all but unmanned, and that those who stood upon it were facing south, rather than north. The Hand was told that Jon Snow had, years earlier, gone forth with a great company of wildlings and northerners, disappearing into the dark forests of the Lands of Always Winter. Their exploration of those unmapped places are the subject of much conjecture: that Snow had been named the King Beyond the Wall, that he had made contact with the last enclaves of the Children of the Forest, that he was overseeing the settling of great underground cities among the twisting, interconnected roots of the Weirwood trees. It is said that the Greyjoys know something of those northernmost lands, and that Sansa Stark, before her death, knew more, but would not tell. The Lonely King, Bran the Broken, Bran the Bridgemaker, Bran the Wheelbreaker, surely knew more still ‚Äì but in his quiet places and sanctuaries around King‚Äôs Landing, he seldom spoke a word, and to each successive Hand and Archmaester he entrusted fewer of his thoughts.

Finally, in 382 AC, at the start of his eighth winter, King Brandon embarked upon a final journey. He had aged but slowly in all the years of his reign, but age had come upon him nevertheless. His Kingsguard escorted him on the first leg of his journey ‚Äì a secretive consultation followed by long weeks of contemplation or reading in Oldtown ‚Äì and then took him as far as the Wall when at last he travelled North. After a night in the almost uninhabited Castle Black, Bran ordered the Kingsguard to return to Winterfell, and so on to the Five Kingdoms, where they were to supervise the selection of a new King of Westeros.

The last of the Starks then travelled North, beyond the wall, quite alone. The Lord Commander of the Night‚Äôs Watch reported that distant figures joined the King‚Äôs horse just before it disappeared into the treeline. No sight or word of King Bran has been heard in the long years since.

The winters are deeper now, and though King‚Äôs Landing is again fair and no great wars have troubled Westeros for many decades, some of the world‚Äôs wonder has diminished since the end of the time of Bran the Wheelbreaker.

64,blsg1b,[SPOILERS] I think I finally figured out what has been bothering me about this season,"This show has always made me angry.  I was angry when they executed Lady, I was angry when they executed Ned, I was angry with what they did to Drogo, I was angry after the Red Wedding, I was angry when the Nights Watch turned on Jon and murdered him, I was angry when Oberyn Martell died...I have been angry at a lot of things during this show.

&#x200B;

However, who I was angry at has changed.

&#x200B;

When they executed Lady, I was angry at Sansa for lying and Cersei for demanding Lady's death.

When they executed Ned, I was angry at Joffrey for being a sniveling little prick.

When Drogo died due to the witch, I was angry at Dany for being a twit demanding the women to be saved and going against Dothroki culture and I was angry at Drogo for going along with it.  I wasn't angry with the witch...she had her reasons.

When they massacred everyone at the Red Wedding, I was angry at the Freys, I was angry at the Boltons, and I was angry at Catelyn for all her stupid decisions that brought them there.

When the Night's Watch killed Jon, I was angry at them...and Ollie most of all.

When Oberyn Martell died, I was angry at him for delaying the killing blow.

&#x200B;

I was angry at all these characters because they were all written fantastically and their actions made sense...even if I was angry at them because they killed off a character I really liked.  It was the characters actions that made me angry, and thus made me invested in the story.

&#x200B;

Lately though...when something happens...I now get angry at the writers because the characters actions no longer make any sense.

I'm not angry at Arya for killing the Night King...I'm angry at the writers because it makes no sense.

I'm not angry at Dany for not seeing the ships that killed Rhaegal, I'm angry at the writers because ANYONE would be able to see a fleet of ships from that far up in the air.

I'm not angry at the characters that didn't die during the battle of winterfell...I'm angry at the writers for showing them in impossible situations and having them survive.

&#x200B;

So basically, Game Of Thrones has always made me angry...but it used to be in a good way that invested me into the show and interested in what happens next...I cared about the characters future, even the ones I hated.  But now I just don't care...nothing makes sense anymore so I no longer care what happens.  If Cersei wins, whatever...If Dany wins, whatever...If Jon wins, whatever...If Ghost sits on the Iron Throne, whatever.

98,bl6bu1,[SPOILERS] Euron Greyjoy is the worst written character of this series by a mile. That is all.,"That's three times now where Euron has gleefully just come out of nowhere and deus-ex-machina'd yet another of Dannaerys' armies. She started with... The Reach, Dorne, the Unsullied, and the Dothraki. Euron's killed three of them as they just sit at sea unable to see his ships coming.

We all called it last episode of course. It would be another stupid ambush where no one sees big-ass ships. Yep, it's gonna be ballestae arrows shot from a whole mile away that will hit the sidekick dragon multiple times with pinpoint accuracy, because why not? (Sidenote: What do dragons even do in this universe if you can kill them with easily mass-manufactured weapons made of fucking wood? There's no way in hell Aegon could have conquered one of the kingdoms, let alone all of them.) Back to Euron: Literally every time he's done anything in this show, it's always a card of ""surprise,"" it always rolls a 20, and there's never any logic to it. And Euron does it while half-drunk with a grin on his face making it look easy. This is just the laziest villain you could imagine for this show.",5077,32344,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bl6bu1/spoilers_euron_greyjoy_is_the_worst_written/,2019-05-06 06:25:55

Jon Targaryen. The Rightful Heir to the Seven Kingdoms.

Edit- For those wondering what this means to Dany's claim, Jon is ahead of her in succession. This is due to being the first born son of Rhaegar, as he was the first born son of Aerys. 

For those saying that by right of Conquest, that Robert usurped the Targaryen lineage. Upon his death, his ""children's"" deaths, and his brothers deaths as well, the true heir would go back to Jon (Stark) Targaryen, by way of Robert's grandmother being a Targaryen. See this [terribly drawn graphic](http://imgur.com/bJhbrAE) for that.

Cersei being Queen, is her own right of ""conquest"", which is another thing completely.",5933,32298,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6tjdrm/main_spoilers_gilly_with_the_nuclear_bomb_drop/,2017-08-14 05:55:16

215,bqpfj0,[SPOILERS] drogon,"i really think drogon is the character that has the most sense in the episode. he didn‚Äôt kill jon for killing daenerys, instead, he destroys the one thing that caused all this tragedy in the first place. what a champ. i hope he lives a good life away from the bullshit that is westeros lol.

EDIT: whatever reason you think why drogon burned the throne in the end (whether it be because he knew that the throne caused dany‚Äôs death or because he thought she stabbed herself on one of the swords in it), you have to admit it‚Äôs a pretty poetic end to the throne. let people enjoy the goddamn show if they want to.

EDIT: this is my last edit, don‚Äôt worry. i‚Äôve been receiving a lot of backlash and unnecessarily mean comments, and i understand why. but this show, like everything else, has always been open up to interpretation. whether it be the craziest, most questionable theory, to one that‚Äôs more believable ‚Äî who are you to shun any speculation? the show has given us little to no information about a lot of things, in this case, a dragon‚Äôs intelligence, and they‚Äôve recently been very inconsistent with lore. 

go ahead, feel free to debunk my little headcanon. that‚Äôs how discussion works, and i‚Äôm open to criticism. what i cannot stand is how extremely callous fans can be towards other fans who have opinions and mindsets different from what they believe. maybe it really is because of bad writing, but what do you have against people who try to put reason behind this?",3048,24380,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bqpfj0/spoilers_drogon/,2019-05-20 06:23:53

237,bistsw,"[Spoilers] After all this show has taught us, I‚Äôm disappointed you all have forgotten its key lessons.","This is my first reddit post, but after seeing the hate that episode 70 is getting (plot armor, night king died too easy, azor ahai), I wanted to throw in a few points I‚Äôve notice, so bare with me. 

We have not been paying attention, this show has time and time again told us to expect the unexpected, to plan for every outcome. It‚Äôs told us that as much as you‚Äôve believe you‚Äôre the hero, or the prince that was promised, or you‚Äôre special, you‚Äôre not. Fuck fate. 

No one is special. Beric was brought back to life some 16 time or so. And all that was so he could save a young woman in some hallways. The nK was supposed to destroy mankind and he was killed by the unexpected. A nobody to him. Fuck fate.

Jon was told he was the prince who was promised, he was brought back to life. He‚Äôs the hero of the show who wants to save people, and all he did throughout the episode was fail at that. He couldn‚Äôt stop the night king, he couldn‚Äôt save his friends. Fuck fate. 

Dany is the savior of the realm, the mother of dragons, and she is tossed to the ground to fight in the mud and blood, making her just another person fighting for their lives. It took Jorah by her side to protect her, which is fine because that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs ever wanted to do, and he succeeded. 

The plot armor you guys are complaining about, is just story telling. Each person alive still has a role to play against Cersei or for their own gain. 

You expected death for everyone and you didn‚Äôt get it.
You expected more from the night king and you didn‚Äôt get it. 
You expected an Azor Ahai and you didn‚Äôt get it. 

I have not known game of thrones to kill off key people in the midst of a battle. It‚Äôs always in small scuffles or when you don‚Äôt expect there to be any death. Deceit and trickery is the game, and the game is back on. Expect the unexpected.",4422,23069,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bistsw/spoilers_after_all_this_show_has_taught_us_im/,2019-04-29 22:22:14

292,bo68h5,[Spoilers] Someone in another subreddit posted something crazy. Everyone in this episode faced their deepest fear," Posted by Julzisda11

## [Spoilers] In this episode everyone faced their demons

The theme throughout this entire episode was succumbing to your demons, this wasn't just about Dany's madness, the coin flip landed for every character on the board

\-Cerci to her arrogance -Jamie to his love for Cerci -Sandor to his desire for revenge -Qyburn to his monster ala Frankenstein -Euron to his arrogance -Tyrion to his love for his family -Dany to her madness

Jon and Arya were also tested, Jon with his loyalty and Arya with her desire for revenge and their antithesis characters were greyworm and the hound. They represent the alternate path they could have chosen. Greyworm and Jon were faced with exactly the same choice at the same time just as Arya and the Hound were. Greyworm chose his loyalty to dany whereas Jon defied his loyalty to do the right thing, Arya chose to live rather than succumb to revenge as the hound did. All in all this episode was heavy with theme and I loved it for it.



Also another thing to note is that those who adapted against their demons survived. Arya and Jon did not succumb to theirs and they survived whereas the others who gave in died. I'm assuming Grey worm and Daenerys won't have a good time next episode.",2376,20972,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bo68h5/spoilers_someone_in_another_subreddit_posted/,2019-05-13 21:11:07

295,bki9hy,[Spoilers]Why The Long Night Episode makes perfect sense.,"I've rewatched this episode about 4 times now and just as I was on the first watch, on the second watch, third watch, fourth watch ,I'm certain. I've come to a conclusion.

**Only a character that was not on The Night King's Radar at all could've possibly killed him.**

Here is why:

Throughout the Episode *The Long Night*. The Night King keeps away from the battle until victory is all but assured. The people complaining about Arya killing him have completely ignored the context of the episode prior and everything of this character we've seen until this point.  Jaime said flat out last episode ""*The Night King Will never expose himself because his death is the only way the living win*. ""

And what does the Night King do the entire battle? He keeps any actual threat to him far away. He doesnt join the battle except to screw with the dragons to keep them out of the way.

He Does not go anywhere near any competent fighter with a weapon that's a serious threat to him, or any member of the Night's Watch. Not Brienne, Not Sam, not Jaime not Tormund, not Jorah, not Edd, Not Beric, not Sandor, and especially not Jon Snow.

The people upset expected this to be like a movie where the bad guy does bad guy stuff and the good guys win in a climactic battle, But this is an event that's been prophesized for literally millenia, The Night King **Has** to be aware that some destined, fabled hero is prophecized to destroy him. He is not mindless, he acts with cunning and purpose, he never speaks but he is far from stupid. 

So, if the Night King knows about the prophecy, and knows that Jon Snow likely fits the bill, and knows that Jon Snow has killed a white walker in single combat, and is a Dragon Rider, and all of these things that make him the perfect candidate for The Prince Who was Promised, What would he do? He would make absolutely certain Jon never gets within swinging distance.


Notice how when Jon approached him he just smirks at him and raises the dead around him, how he puts his dragon between him and the god's wood, how he makes sure that the defenders of winterfell are thoroughly occupied on the walls and courtyard so there's no chance of them being able to stop him. The Night King reacted like an intelligence being. 

But, this show has always been about the idea that things are never what they appear, and prophecy is never what you think it is. a Common theme in prophecy is that trying to prevent the future causes it to happen, and destiny cannot be averted, but also destiny is never what you want it to be. 

Theon dies, because He never stood a chance in single combat against the Night King, who let him exhaust himself fighting wights. 

But Arya has had time to rest, Arya only needs a shot, and Night King has never seen Arya before, she is No one. 

No one , but Azor Ahai can kill the Night King, if The Night King stops Azor Ahai Reborn from killing him, Then No one Will.


No one did. 

Death is the enemy, it's the first enemy and it's the last and in the end,      **It Always Wins** 

There's so many little hints that foreshadow this. Arya with the dagger, the image of the dagger appearing in one of sam's books, the little background info that it's forged from a piece of lightbringer, The scene in the godswood with her sneaking up on Jon. Bran's vision of the Night King's Creation.


The Night King is a man, turned into something else, but he is still a *man*.  

This is why Jaquen gave Arya that coin, not to turn her into some faceless assassin to kill Cersei, it's why they trained her, it's her entire purpose. Stop he who has cheated death with magic. Who has stolen from the God of Death over and over, whose very existence is an affront to death, because he is undying, and he robs the many faced god. put right that which the others have wronged. 


Jon is a **King**. Kings do not fight heroic climactic duels, they lead them into battle, they gather people, they move the pieces upon the board.  Jon fighting the Night King in single combat was never going to happen any more than Aragorn was going to fight Sauron in single combat. This is not that kind of story, it never was.


**Jon Is the one who first armed Arya, who started her on this path**

**Jon is the one who united the south and the north**

**Jon is who brought Daenarys and her Dragons making this Possible**

**Jon brought down the wildlings and made it possible for Bran to return home**

**Jon attacking winterfell is what made it possible to stage a defense there**

**Jon Snow is the King who put the pieces into play. He is not the champion who swings the final blow, he never was.**

It is elegant, simple, unexpected,  but perfectly fitting, and thematically appropriate. No other way of ending it would be so perfect.


Edit: Let me first say. The ending made perfect sense,was heavily foreshadowed not the entire episode was without flaw. But use a little critical thinking. 



Why Were the Trebuchets outside the Wall? 

Because you need to see what you're aiming at with a trebuchet and there's not enough room on top the walls of winterfell for them, outside was the only place to put them.

Why didnt they build a bigger trench?

Building a bigger trench would've dramatically increased the time it took to construct and they did not have that kind of time. Nor did they have time to build a second trench or they would have.


Why didnt they have more archers on the walls firing more constantly? 

They need to  be able to see what they're shooting at or they're just wasting ammunition which do not have an unlimited amount of.


Why did they charge the Dothraki into the enemy?

They probably didnt think it'd go that badly? I dunno that one did seem really stupid to me.


Why did they put the unsullied out there too?

To give cover to the trebuchet men outside the wall when falling back.


Why didnt they use more pitch and burning pots of oil?

They didn't have enough so they had to pick what was important (The Trench)


Why wasnt the Dragon able to melt that little rock Jon was hiding behind?

That's a good question, and if I had to come up with a BS answer it was the Dragon was injured and so couldnt produce hot enough flame due to his fucked up face? But that's an utter contrivance.


Why were so many main characters survive despite being surrounded by wights and thought to be dead multiple times? 

For most of them? Steel Armor is hard to get through when you're a hiveminded wight that's using inferior weapons and doesnt know how to get through it, Jaime, Brienne surviving at least makes sense to me, but I got nothing for the other, and tbh I really dont get how a stab to the chest when he's wearing steel plate is going to kill Jorah, that one also felt really BS.



""But Arya Rejected the whole No one thing when she left!""

Yeah, that's totally why they **Let her leave**. Not because she could convincingly play herself, nevermind that she's behaved **Really fucking weirdly** and continues to play the game of faces. It's pretty obvious based on her looks when no one is seeing her that like Bran, Arya's not really Arya anymore. Which is kinda the point, none of the Starks are quite who they were anymore, they're different, or someone new altogether. So many of these complaints just *miss the entire point*. Nah the Faceless men ,who engineered the destruction of valyria, totally didnt help point arya on this path and then let her leave after she rejected 'them' ,she totally wasnt manipulated into doing this from the start or anything.

If it's not spelled out for you in black and white. Yes there's continuity and realism flaws with some of the stuff, but that doesnt mean that everything in the episode is shit. 


But Why did Melisandre act as if she knew all along?

Acting like a smug know it all when she puts the pieces together at the last second is kinda Melisandre's thing. She did it to Stannis, she did it to Jon, now she's done it to Arya because it's what she does. She showed confidence and this ""I knew all along"" shit to her because what, she's going to, trying to encourage arya to go kill the night king act like she's just improvising and doesnt know this shit? Context matters.




Edit 2:

About the Dragons and those of you saying The Night King exposed himself to the Dragons thus making my point about him not exposing himself moot:


It's clear, based on the episode that no, Those Dragons were never any real threat to *Him*. The Dragons are a danger to his wight army, and would endanger his plan so he needed to get his dragon to pull them away from the battle and kite them up away from it. Dragonfire and Dragon Teeth and Claw can't hurt him any more than steel weapons can or fists can. Dragonglass and Valyrian Steel are the only things that we've seen can hurt a White Walker, anything else shatters on impact or loses it's heat as it gets close.  

So, Yes, the Night King exposes himself to things which are no danger to him at all. Your mistake is thinking of the Night King as if he is a regular dude.  He doesnt let Jon get close enough to him with his Valyrian Steel Sword, and puts up wights to give him room leave. 

Could some enterprising and clever archer put an arrow through his face and kill him? Possibly, we don't know because he made sure all the archers likely to take a shot at him were busy being overwhelmed by an army of the dead and desperately trying to save himself and his friends.  Could anyone have come and taken a shot at with a sword or an axe? Yeah probably and they would've ended up like Theon because he was walking with a bunch of White Walkers guarding him. The only moment he's not surrounded by either an undead dragon, wights, or white walkers is the briefest moment when Jon runs at him, and he raises the dead, or the moment he kills theon and he's about to kill Bran and has made way for it. That's when Arya Strikes


As some other Redditors have pointed out. The prophecy of Azor Ahai Reborn never once states he will beat the Night King, it says he will pull a sword from fire that shall be lightbringer, and The Darkness will run from him, and what does the Night King do to Jon? He sees him pull Longclaw from a burning building and kill a white walker with it. He sees him again and keeps his distance beyond the wall, putting wights between him and Jon. And a third time, he sees him and turns and leaves keeping obstacles between them. Jon IS Azor Ahai, But the prophecy was never about him destroying the Night King Personally.",5761,20921,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bki9hy/spoilerswhy_the_long_night_episode_makes_perfect/,2019-05-04 10:18:18

302,4pndkb,[EVERYTHING] Jon's story in 'Battle of the Bastards' isn't what people think,"Jon's story this season has been about his death.  Not the death of his body, which lasted a few episodes and about a single day in the in-universe timeline.  This season has been about the death of his spirit, a much more meaningful death than mere flesh.  The death of his spirit stretched out with pieces of Jon being chipped away until he had no hope, only fear and despair.  That despair comes to a head when Rickon dies in front of him, and its why he charged the Bolton lines all alone.  He wasn't fooled or lured out.  He was looking for an end.

'Battle of the Bastards' isn't a story about fighting to regain a home or a title.  **'Battle of the Bastards' is the story of Jon's resurrection.**

People who say that Jon hasn't noticeably changed by coming back from death have missed the change, because *they expected the change to be for the better*. Jon's behavior this season has been characterized by **fear.** Fear of death, certainly. But more than that is fear of not having a say in his own fate. Jon's life has mostly sucked for the past 5 years, and then he was murdered by his own men. That would make anybody afraid of the future, that all its going to be is more shit and misery. As he says to Sansa:

>Jon: I'm tired of fighting. Its all I've done since I left Winterfell... I've fought, and I lost.

Jon shows that fear every time he is reminded that he can't control his own fate. When anybody mentions his death, he looks like a beaten dog. When Sansa wants to retake Winterfell, he wants nothing to do with it, and he only agrees to it when Sansa presses him with the knowledge that Ramsey has Rickon. Even when he agrees, he looks afraid, like he wants to be anywhere in the world other than where he is, or maybe be anybody other than *who* he is.

This leads to the discussions the night before the battle. In talking with Sansa its clear that Jon doesn't believe they'll win, but he doesn't have any other choice than to follow the path he is on.

>Sansa: Its not enough!

>Jon: No its not enough, its what we have!

This is followed by one of the most devastating exchanges I've ever seen on the show.

>Sansa: I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?

>Jon: I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise.

>Sansa: No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.

Setting aside what this says about Sansa's state of mind, this exchange is *devastating* to Jon's state of mind. **Protecting Sansa is the only task Jon has willingly embraced since dying.**  Jon is only at Winterfell because of Sansa and Rickon, and now Sansa has declared that he is powerless to do the one thing he wants to do: protect his family.

This declaration of Jon's powerlessness is followed by his conversation with Melisandre where he asks Mel not to bring him back if he dies. Thats Jon trying to gain power over at least one thing: the ability to have it all end for good, and not be forced back into the shit and misery again. Mel won't even give him that, because she has to try, and its up to the Lord of Light as to whether or not Jon is brought back.

>Mel: Maybe he brought you here to die again.

>Jon: What kind of god would do something like that?

>Mel: The one we've got.

At this point, Jon has control over nothing. He can't protect his family, he's on the verge of a battle he never wanted, he doesn't have enough men to have any real control over whether they win or lose, and he can't even trust that death will bring it all to an end. His hope for the future is hanging on by a thread.

Then Ramsey lets Rickon run across the field. Forget all that ""Jon is a Stark who is loyal to his family"" stuff. This is much simpler. The only thing Jon is living for at this moment is to protect the two family members he can. One of them just denied that he can protect her. The other one is running across the field with arrows flying down.  When Rickon starts running across the field, there is only one thing left for Jon: protect his little brother. He has no power, only the thread of hope that he can do that.

Rickon dies, and the screen darkens as the camera looks down at him from Jon's perspective. When Jon looks at Ramsey its not with anger but with despair. **The gods keep pouring shit down on Jon, and spat in the face of the last bit of hope he had.**

Thats why he charges. True, there were arrows coming down that he was trying to outrun, but they were being released in volleys; he could have tried turning around and escaping between volleys. But he wasn't trying to escape the arrows, or lead his men to victory, or kill Ramsey. He was charging as a challenge to the gods, either to keep him alive or let him die in peace. When his horse goes down, he thinks he has an answer: the gods didn't bring him there to magically pull out a victory, they really did bring him there just to die again. But at the very last second his own men catch up, and he has to fight.

As the battle progresses, he finds himself buried beneath the bodies, the metaphor of the gods pouring misery down on his head suddenly becoming literal. He could have stopped there, give up and suffocate beneath the weight. Thats what makes the 'rebirth' scene so powerful: he claws his way back out and *declares that he wants to live*. Even Kit Harington describes the scene [this way](http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/682554/Game-of-Thrones-Kit-Harington-Jon-Snow-Daenerys-Targaryen):

>‚ÄúWhen the crush starts happening, he slows down, and there's that thing of peace where he thinks: 'I could just stay here and let it all end.‚Äô ""And then something drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again. . .""

After a season where Jon has wanted to run away, a season of fear and worry, a season where he has no control, he declares in the face of all of it that he still wants to live. This is followed almost immediately by defeat turning into victory, with the gods sending salvation in the form of saviors from the Vale. When Jon climbs over the bodies and stares down Ramsey, he has a look in his eyes he hasn't had all season, one that I don't think he's ever had on the show: the look of absolute intent, a man who knows what he wants and is about to go take it.

This season has been about Jon's death. First the death of his body. Then the death of his belief, and the death of his will. Then finally the death of his hope.

Only in the final minutes of 'Battle of the Bastards' has Jon truly returned to life, and now we'll finally see the change that everybody expected back when life returned to his body.

416,bl6kpo,[SPOILERS] Theory: Tyrion‚Äôs mistake is his most clever maneuver.,"When Tyrion approaches the gates of King‚Äôs Landing to appeal to Cersei‚Äôs love for her children, he tells her to surrender for her child. Euron was standing right behind Cersei, and he just found out about ‚Äúhis‚Äù child moments before this scene. From Euron‚Äôs point of view, Tyrion should have no knowledge that Cersei is pregnant - Tyrion was up in the North when he slept with Cersei for the first time. 

It might not have been intentional on Tyrion‚Äôs part, but I think that Euron might realize that Cersei‚Äôs baby isn‚Äôt his, turn on Cersei, and potentially kill her. If Tyrion realized what he was doing, he hid it well. If not, it may unintentionally have huge payoffs for Dany, and likely be his most ‚Äúclever‚Äù move yet.

456,biqx8a,"[SPOILERS] The clues were all there, we just refused to see them.","**The motivation of the Night King:**
This was clearly explained in the show. The Night King was created by the CotF to kill human, that's what he was trying to do. He wanted an endless night and to erase all memory of human. That's exactly what he was trying to do. I think we were just expecting some crazy twist to happen, but at least it make sense with what was said in the show. I prefer something simple that make sense with the story, that something crazy that will make no sense when rewatching all the seasons.


**Arya killing the Night King:**
*""Green eye, brown eye, blue eye. Eyes you will close forever.""* This was foreshadow in S3.
Her whole story was around the God of Death. And Death is literally the Night King in the story. Also, Bran gave her the dagger in S7. So it was pretty clear that Arya was meant to kill the Night King. Again, I think we just expected some crazy shit like Bran going in the past and fucking around some timelines, which 90% of the viewers would have no idea WTF just happened.


**The Army of the Dead dealt in Ep3:**
They filmed for 50+ nights to created the longest and most promising episode of the serie. They put everything on the table for this episode. There's no way the AotD would have survived this episode. Because if they survived, this mean that we need another bigger battle to defeat them. And with all the casualties, there's no logic way to make the living survive. Also, I don't see how Jon and co could have escaped the battle alive and I don't see the Night King retreating either. So, it had to end here. The AotD won at the Fist of the First Man, at Hardhome and Beyond the Wall, but they were defeated in Winterfell, because *everyone* decided to fight together. I don't feel like this has been rushed. This battle has been build up for 8 Seasons and it ended with the biggest episode ever produced.

Anyway, just my two cents. I think the plot was simpler that some of the hardcore fans wanted, but at least it make sense with the narrative and the final battle was truly epic.",4152,15822,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/biqx8a/spoilers_the_clues_were_all_there_we_just_refused/,2019-04-29 19:40:55

475,binsug,"[SPOILERS] The ""Bran is the Lord of Light"" theory is all but confirmed this episode, and G.R.R.M. himself gave the big clue last year. The real origin origin of the Dagger.","Hear me out.

In an [interview](http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/) with Time Magazine last year, G.R.R.M. explicitly made sure to bring up Beric Dondarrion.

""he‚Äôs not a living human being anymore. His heart isn‚Äôt beating, his blood isn‚Äôt flowing in his veins, he‚Äôs a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we‚Äôre getting back to the whole fire and ice thing""

So Beric is a ""fire wight"". And thats obviously foreshadowing something. The big question is, if the Night King animates the ice wights, who then animates the fire wights?

Here are the **Facts**:

1. Bran is a powerful warg. We know he gets visions of the past, present and future‚Ä¶and can manipulate the past to help save his future self. We don't yet know the extent of this power.  

2. We knew the Night King can reanimate the dead into evil still-dead soldiers. But this episode we learned he can also manipulate snow and ice at will, sending a full blown blizzard. (This is key.)

3.  Followers of the Lord of Light believe that their Lord is always at war with his evil opposite diety. Theres always a dichotomy. Light vs Dark. Good vs Bad. Fire vs Ice. Everything in this world has an antithesis. 

4. The 3 eyed raven seems to be NK's eternal adversary. He intentionally killed the OG 3 eyed raven, and ever since he's been after Bran. 

5. The lord of light supposedly has a ""purpose"" for everyone. Consequently, everyone supposedly brought back by the lord of light helped Arya defeat the Night King.

6. Bran gave Arya the dagger, and offered himself as bait. So like the Lord of Light, everything Bran has done recently also ultimately leads to Arya defeating the Night King.
	
What we can take from this‚Ä¶

- If the Night King is Lord of Death, Night, and Ice‚Ä¶he should have an equal opposite. That opposite would of course be the Lord of Life, Light, and Fire  (ie. The Lord of Light) . 

- The Night King is a physical entity, his opposite should be too. The Lord of Light likely has a physical presence (or a physical champion at the very least). So who is it? they don't ever explicitly show any other being with NK's level of power (or do they?)

- If the Night King can reanimate the dead, his ""light"" opposite should have an equal level of power to bring life.  And if NK's reanimated dead fight for evil, then his opposite's reanimated dead would fight for good/the living. 

- George R.R. Martin confirmed this logic, with his mentioning the existence of the ""Fire Wight"". Beric, Jon, (and maybe the Hound) are one of them. So the above theory that the Lord of Light is the NK's opposite holds water

- If the NK can manifest snow and ice at will. Then his opposite should be able to manifest fire at will. And maybe...communicate with others through it.

- Bran and the Lord of Light are working towards the same goal. 

- The 3 Eyed Raven is the NK's ultimate adversary‚Ä¶.the force hes always at battle with.
  
The simplest explanation to all of this ...The 3 Eyed Raven is the Night King's opposite. The NK's opposite is the Lord of Light. Therefore, Bran = the Lord of Light (or at least what people think is the Lord of Light due to the signs he brings)

So how does this play out?

**********************************************
**The Dagger Arch**

First consider the dagger.

The entire storyline from Season 1 on revolves around the dagger. And the entire dagger story is intrinsically linked to Bran. 

We also know the dagger is ancient, as it appears in Sam's book.  Its been passed down from generation to generation, as all existing Valerian steel has been. https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gameofthrones/images/9/97/Valyrian_steel_dagger_game_of_thrones_catspaw_blade_sam.png/revision/latest?cb=20170723084654

We don't actually know for sure who owned the dagger, or where the assassin got it. Littlefinger claims it was his but later denies it. Even if it was Littlefinger's, its never explained where he got it. This is important.

**********************************************

**The Theory**

It all but obvious at this point, Bran has been manipulating the plotline the entire time. He knew exactly how the battle was going to end. He knew exactly how to kill the Night King, because he set the trap himself. While warging during the battle, he was likely manipulating events to lead to the final conclusion.

 Everything he has done has revolved around getting the dagger to Arya and getting her safely to the NK. That plan was set in motion all the way back in Season 1. 

Future Bran made sure that dagger was sent to kill his childhood self. He put the key piece in play. He then warged into Summer to kill the assassin. 

 Farther back than that, the dagger may have belonged to Aerys Targarian (passed down through their family), and Bran messed with him to make sure it got where it needed to go. (Maybe Jaime or Littlefinger picked it up after the Mad King was slain).

It‚Äôs possible the dagger was even forged originally for the purpose of killing the Night King thousands of years later.

Arya's training was also crucial/pre-planned. She would have never trained to kill without....1) Bran's assassination attempt being pinned on Tyrion (because of the dagger). And 2) King Robert's Death. 

We already know how he could have manipulated the assassination. He could have also been warged into the wild boar that killed King Robert, if it were for the good of the realm.

Melesandre told Arya last episode what Syrio Forel told her before he was killed, ""What do we say to the god of death? Not today"". Homage to the fact that her training was all destined from the beginning. 

All of the war and death that was sparked because of Bran. He knew it would happen, but he saw how the alternative story lines would play out, where the Night King wins. He sacrificed whoever he had to for the good of the realm. Much like lord Varys (who he spoke to through the flames after he was cut)

All of the ""magical Lord of Light moments"" that are supposedly the God's work, are actually Bran manipulating the past, resurrecting people and making sure Arya got the knife and made it to kill NK.

- Beric getting brought back to life so many times‚Ä¶.it wasn't the shitty priest saying a prayer. Both he and Melesandre said he shouldn't have that power. In fact, it was Bran bringing him back to life so he could help Arya during the battle. 

- The hound surviving. Septon Ray told him he thought he was a corpse. He also told him that he pretty much died multiple times while he was recovering, but he kept coming back to life. After he comes back to life, he's fighting for good.  Again, hound ended up a key figure in getting Arya to the NK. 
	
- Jon coming back. No evidence again to suggest Melesandre's prayer did it. She completely gave up, and he didn't come back to life until a while after.

- The trench lighting on fire‚Ä¶again, it didn't seem to be Melesandre's words that did it. You could see she was getting frustrated/confused when it wasn't working at first. It was actually Bran summoning fire.

- Lord Varys hearing the voice in the flames after he was cut....which is said to be what lead to him ending up in King's Landing and rising to power. After that scene with the priestess in the Pyramid, it cut to Bran‚Äôs face. 

We know Bran is the most powerful living being other than the Night King. We know both he and the Lord of Light are working towards the same goal, and both manipulate the storyline. 

It makes sense that Bran is the Lord of light, and all past 3 Eyed Ravens were also the Lord of Light.  Or at the very least they‚Äôre representatives of him .

Where was Bran during the battle? Making shit happen. This would make the Night King's death wayyy less anticlimactic than it was. 

Some  interesting questions then come up if this all plays out. When the Whites die, their wights they turned die. 

If Bran dies, does Jon automatically die too?

Now that the Night King is dead, whos the Lord of Light's new opposite to balance out the dichotomy? (Cersei? Danny? perhaps)

**************************
**Further Evidence**

- Bran's powers are strongest by the Weirwood trees. Aka the ""Heart Trees"" The trees were worshiped by the First Men (and Children of the forest?) as gods.  They're known as ""Heart Trees"".   The lord of light is also known as the ""Heart of Fire"", with a symbolic heart.

- The Children of the Forest brought back Benjen as a fire-wielding fire wight. They're obviously the key to the power of both the NK and the Lord of Light. They could have created the 3 eyed raven/LoL the same as they created the NK as a counter balance

- Bran (or the OG 3 eyed raven) are likely who drove Aerys II Targaryen mad, whispering for him to ""Burn them all"". He's been fighting the future battle from the past for a long time. 
 
- In the episode followup commentary, they implied they randomly picked Arya to kill the NK at some point; and wove the episode to heighten the surprise.

482,bo2jqf,[Spoilers] It was fear that broke her,"The Mad Queen descent was rushed, but I've seen a lot of people all over the Internet make fun of the bells and at Daenerys' mind breaking at the point of surrender but it made sense and was set up earlier in the episode.

Season 1 to 7 showed up a Daenerys that rose from the very lowest of lows to the height of power. In Season 1 and 2, we see Daenerys realize that without power, no one will respect her or take her claim seriously. She‚Äôs told repeatedly that she‚Äôs nothing without an army, and she‚Äôs nothing without ships. She gains those. We cheer for her.

**When Daenerys leaves Essos, she thinks she can rule through compassion and be** ***loved*** **by the people once she gets rid of Cersei.** She had her armies. She had dragons. She had powerful allies in Westeros. She had the strongest claim to the throne and finally had the chance to take King‚Äôs Landing.

Season 7 and Season 8 was about losing that power. First, her powerful allies are stripped away one by one. Olenna, Elliria, Yara. Tyrion mismanages them as Hand of the Queen and makes horrible tactical mistakes.

**In S08E01, Daenerys realizes she doesn‚Äôt have the love of the people.** In Essos, she broke their chains and earned their devotion and became their Mysha. She freed them from their oppressive masters and they were grateful to her and made her their queen. In the North, Sansa and Jon had already broken their chains. They defeated Ramsay. Sansa and Jon, as Starks, have earned their loyalty for a lifetime. Daenerys is faced with a smallfolk ‚Äî her subjects ‚Äî that don‚Äôt love her. It‚Äôs a harsh realization for her.

**In S08E02, she loses her claim.** Jon tells her his true identity, and suddenly she‚Äôs not the only Targaryen in the world. Even moreso, Jon‚Äôs claim is stronger. He‚Äôs a natural leader. She‚Äôs immediately threatened by his confession, and is shaken by it.

**In S08E03, she loses Jorah.** He was there for her since the beginning. He was devoted to her not because of her power, not because of her dragons, but because he loved her. He never would‚Äôve betrayed her and she trusted him fully. He‚Äôs essentially been her rock through all her hardship. And then he dies protecting her.

**In S08E04, she loses her second child, and Missandei. O**ne by one, everyone she held close that was devoted to her and her alone was taken from her. Her dragons were a symbol of her power; with only one left, she was beginning to get desperate. Her only advisor from Essos was Grey Worm, and he was a soldier.

**In S08E05, she loses Varys, Tyrion, and Jon**. Through betrayal, no less. Jon betrays her by telling Sansa, and Sansa tells Tyrion, who tells Varys. Varys openly conspires against her and (presumably) tries to poison her and turn Jon against her. She kills him without a trial, without asking for his last words, and without a second thought. At that point, she‚Äôs on the brink.

And Jon goes to her, and she seeks one last bit of comfort from him. She tells him that people love him, and that‚Äôs something she‚Äôll never have.

>**‚ÄùFar more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don‚Äôt have love here. I only have fear.‚Äù**

He counters by saying that he loves her, and that she‚Äôll always be his queen. But when they kiss, Daenerys realizes that he‚Äôll never truly love her again. And so, she says: **""Alright then. Let it be fear""**

When the bells ring, **Daenerys realizes that while the city has surrendered she‚Äôll never be secure as queen as long as the people don‚Äôt truly, irrevocably fear her.** **She will never be loved by them.** She has lost everything she has gained and every friend she‚Äôs made, and she‚Äôs completely alone. King‚Äôs Landing becomes a symbol of everything she‚Äôs ever been through ‚Äî her brother selling her like a brood mare, Drogo's death, being ridiculed and laughed at from Pentos to Slaver's Bay to Mereen, being threatened at every turn, losing her dragons, losing her loved ones. She‚Äôs on her dragon, she‚Äôs alone, she feels powerless, and she‚Äôs *angry*.

So what does she do when feels powerless? She reminds them all that she is still powerful. The people will never love her, so they will fear her.",2127,15196,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/bo2jqf/spoilers_it_was_fear_that_broke_her/,2019-05-13 15:58:20
