So yeah, he definitely fled the first sign of trouble.  I like to think the people fixed it themselves, but it's Game of Thrones, and there's a fat chance of that happening.","That plot line never existed. Like every other that was forgotten about. 

In all seriousness, the slavers probably took back control.",Slaver's Bay is ruined by both Dany's actions and the plague. The Free Cities are stronger than ever. Westeros will be invaded by whoever wants it.,"Daario ruthlessly and pragmatically starts weeding out the sons of the harpy with specialized search and destroy teams but the iron bank secretly tries to bring slavery back by financing aid to the harpies. The former slaves, with greater numbers eventually outlast the former slavers willing to fight and the iron bank cuts their losses, but not before Daario’s name is given to the faceless god. He dies, abandoned by the only woman he ever truly loved, having spent the rest of his life from that point helping the liberated former slaves she told him to protect. She’s the one given monuments and credit in the histories for liberating the people. But he’s the one who did the bulk of the dirty work and stuck it out until the job was done. He’ll be just a footnote of the events to most people in the future but dedicated historians will know the true weight of his tragically beautiful sacrifice.","What helped me sleep at night after Season 8 was this scenario: Drogan takes Dany to the High Priestess (forget the name) she met, is resurrected, then returns to Meereen where she was loved and continues to rule there...

He passed a new law that allows for all guards to wear masks while on duty.  Also, as a result of being a former slaver area, the governing body goes far in the opposite direction.  Reparations are demanded by former residents, which are known as ""Danydations"".  While the freed peoples are grateful, the Slavers are disgusted by this.  Former Harpies form a new group known as the ""Seventh Sons"".  The group discovered Dany's corpse and have used blood magic to replicate her scent, so that they may tame Drogon.

With her gone, Daario has no motivation to rule using her principles. He will either fall to other slavers or will become a slaver himself. Slavery has been a constant in Slaver's Bay for ages. A couple of years of violent freedom will not change that culture. 

Daario may have some experience in leading an army but he isn't exactly a diplomat. Dany had him, Tyrion, other advisors, and dragons to cover all fronts. With basically just Daario and maybe a few people he trusts it wouldn't be enough to hold a free Slaver's Bay. Daario does know a lot about violence, but you can't rule free people with violence.","Daario governing Mereen was probably no better than Robert being king of Westeros, only Daario didn't have Jon Aryn to at least *attempt* to guide his decisions.

When he heard that Dany had died, he either...

Became a violent drunken mess and took full control of Mereen as a ruthless emperor, or he just packed up and abandoned the city all together. Depends how hard he took Dany's death or whether he even cared to begin with.","Once word reaches Essos of Dani’s death, the Masters will take back control. Yes, the Unsullied sailed to Naath to liberate the slaves there, but their numbers are severely depleted.","\*Starts chanting\*

Spin-off!

Spin-off!

Spin-off!","Like 99% of game of thrones, it meant nothing. Nothing in this show wound up mattering at all.","Daario seems to seek the good deal more than everything.

He has no reason to fulfill the dreamed society of Dany especially if it put him in danger. Either the slavers make a deal with him to bring back their power while he keeps ruling Mereen, either they see him as a traitor and he robs as many gold as he can and flee to a life with no troubles.",Daario and the Second Sons took every valuable thing they could get their hands on and fled before The Sons of the Harpy or some other pro-Slavery/anti-Dany group rises up and either creates a united Ghiscari slaver empire or collapses the region into a state of constant war that'll last a generation.,"I'm pretty positive it'd go back to the way it was eventually.  It wouldn't be hard for those in power or with money to overthrow the current government.  Hell they could probably even just take over and slowly add back in slavery but only for certain reasons or only a certain type of people can become slaves.  They just need to find someone that's a different color and convince people that they're less human and bam, slavery is acceptable again.","There was a season 8?

Must have been a fan fic, because I'm pretty sure GoT stopped after 6 seasons.",Honestly amazes me that people care after the bad taste season 8 left...,They all just ceased to exist as they were no more than afterthoughts at this point.,"Turned into a war zone or a lawless zone I'd say. Each city had a huge power void, Dani left with her dragons, dothraki and unsullied and then there were barely any masters left and the ones that do remain most likely lost most of their slaves. The second sons have 500 members, that's nothing even for a city guard, Daario probably didn't enjoy that power especially without Dani and then if or when he finds out she died then he's just doing for no reason. Dani held the bay with fear and her enemies lacking the power she had like 100k Dothraki, few 1000 unsullied, few hundred second sons and 3 dragons at the time, her army was probably the strongest and largest in the world excluding the army of the dead.",Are humans,Back to business,I love Daario so I hope he somehow managed to stay in power in Meereen.,"Totally destroyed, just like the show after season 6",Just absolute Chaos,People kind of forgot about the bay of dragons.,Don't care.,"Swept under the rug

Peace and Prosperity with Daario!*,Those places go back to Slavery and Dario gets killed. Everything rendered pointless. Just like the finale.,The hosts were probably put in hibernation mode by tech given that all guests sailed to Westeros with Dany.,"Bro, someone on here said the best way to turn the show around. They said Drogon took Danys body back to Bay of Dragons to that Red Priestess and they did the whole bringing back to life thing that they did to Jon. Imagine if season 8 just a had a little clip of this and the last thing we see is Dany taking a breath and then opening her eyes showing bright purple. Bro I wouldn’t mind season 8 that bad if that was how they ended it","The society she set up will thrive.
The slaves will always remember the good that came from her rule that let to a equal society.
The ole masters will learn their trade would not continue and will adapt.
Eventually the two factions will interbreed and become the people of the city state.

Thus any returning slavers would meet the same fate as the previous funders of the sons of the harpy.",They probably all kind of forgot that they used to be slavers. So it's fine now.,"I would continue the story by having Dany's body returned to the Dothraki. She survived the fire, perhaps she could return from the sword. And as we all know, being dead wasn't necessarily the end for a lot of other characters. Once she returned to health, Drogon led her to more dragon eggs (or perhaps produced some himself - who knows dragon physiology?) which she raised. As Mother of Dragons she grew into immortality and traveled to right her wrongs.  (Well, a girl can hope)","I imagine it would be fairly horrible, but that's not too strange, a lot of movies leave behind destroyed worlds without giving a damn.

Like, maybe the locals ""forgot"" they existed. And Arya just circumnavigates like ""What the fuck""

Huh, that's actually a bit fun to consider. Instead of laziness, what if a lot of the stuff we hated happened because of plot convenient brain damage, like how Tyrion and Varys are just like, hypoxia-ed out all the time.

I always wanted the confirmation that he let everything go to shit, was a dictator, or simply left. 

This is one of those things that when people argue the later Dany reveal that she only cared about conquering and blood and never really cared about people came out of nowhere clearly proves this was always the intention of George RR Martin with the showrunners simply having no talent in being able to write without direct source material.",She said there will be instructions left for him and that the people will choose amongst themselves how to govern Meereen. From my memory of it,Dany kinda forgot about Mereen.,oh you mean like how >!Jon being Aegon Targyeron!<  meant literately nothing to the overall plotline?,How could an army invade a nation run by a guy who can see everything?,"Braavos was founded as a safe-haven for former slaves, so I doubt the Iron Bank of Braavos would try to bring slavery back.",Imagine the last shot being Dany lying on a table and taking her first breaths a la Jon Snow,Oh shit. I somehow forgot resurrection is a thing in GoT.,Who loved her in Mereen besides Daario? Everybody else was trying to kill her & her posse. Even the slaves turned on her after she executed that one guy.,"But I think resurrection thing was valid only before the purpose is served. Dany wanted to break the wheel and in last episode she served her purpose. So, she was free to die after that.","To me, they should have had Jon refuse an order from her to do something terrible or step in to stop her.  She goes crazed and wild and orders drogon to burn him.  Either drogon does and Jon is unharmed, like her and becomes the new unburnt or drogon refuses.  Dany goes completely crazy and attacks Jon with a knife.  In defending himself the blade turns in and she impales herself on it.  She turn lucid and back to her “good” self and looks at Jon.  She apologizes and charges him with being a good king and she dies.  

Maybe that’s too happy for GoT, but I think that ending makes a ton of sense and fulfills the plot in a way that the story lends us to.","That helps you sleep?

There is no way a new field of Masters didn't just rise up and take control. You can't upend hundreds of years (at least) of how things are done and just leave without expecting it to go back.,"Daario: Ruler of Meereen makes even less sense than Bronn: Master of Coin. At least Bronn is really good at schmoozing people which is a pretty important qualification for the job. Daario literally says ""fuck the people, fuck Meereen"" when he's appointed. 10/10 decision making, Daenerys.",The people are recently freed slaves most of whom probably can't even read.  The odds of them selecting a good form of governance as opposed to slipping into civil war are historically not great.,"Yep. Instructions. As daario himself said he got plenty of discipline as a child and has an easy time following orders, has never betrayed his partners, and is not the leader of a band of professional thugs. 
 
But yeah those instructions will surely keep him and his men loyal to the cause, even after her death. Big time.

You: “Agreed. Change doesn’t happen overnight, and slaves had been around for a long time.”

This is like watching two people hold entirely separate conversations with themselves, completely ignoring the other person.","They don't really need a good form of governance off the bat.  They are a city full of motivated people with low expectations, who know how to do almost every job in the city, since they were the ones doing it.  And the amount of crime will be very low, because I doubt many people start a life of crime immediately after being freed as a slave.

They would likely have a significant honeymoon period where things would work just fine, and they would have ample opportunity to refine whatever form of governance they want.  It would take a concerted effort by a major outside player to destabilise the city.",Nah it’s the fact that he didn’t want to smash anymore.,"Dany could have easily gone mad without Jon being Aegon though.  Varys was already plotting against her because she was going crazy before the whole Aegon Targaryen thing came to light.

And Dany going mad king all over king's landing would have made Jon change allegiances, with or without a claim.

The whole story could have left that whole plotline out and it would be largely the exact same thing, and everything would still make sense (Except I guess the whole ""It's out of character for Ned to have a bastard son"" plot).","Like in sports, sometimes it's good to have a trick up your sleeve, some deception in a play. But sometimes a superior team can outright tell the other team what play they're running, say ""try to stop us,"" and still succeed.",I think you're underestimating the power of unlimited intel.,"Because an army of innumerable dead would be underwhelmed by an army of living....

The only thing bran see's is winning.","Also, I would argue that particular scene with the Iron Bank and Cersei was another big mistake by 2D. Either that, or the guy was just sort of playing along with what she said. I'd be willing to bet a large amount of money that in the books the Iron Bank has absolutely zero stake in the slave trade.

I’ll have to find it again.","> The books inform the show, not the other way around.
