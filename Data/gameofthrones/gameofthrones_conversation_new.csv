https://youtu.be/dPuM5JXvD4w","Either the slavers took control, or Daario is Emperor of Meereen.","It was always bizarre to me that Dany left Daario in charge.  He clearly never gave two fucks about Meereen or the Free Cities.

So yeah, he definitely fled the first sign of trouble.  I like to think the people fixed it themselves, but it's Game of Thrones, and there's a fat chance of that happening.","That plot line never existed. Like every other that was forgotten about. 

In all seriousness, the slavers probably took back control.","What helped me sleep at night after Season 8 was this scenario: Drogan takes Dany to the High Priestess (forget the name) she met, is resurrected, then returns to Meereen where she was loved and continues to rule there... Maybe she forges another army and returns the favor to Westeros, maybe not lol",Slaver's Bay is ruined by both Dany's actions and the plague. The Free Cities are stronger than ever. Westeros will be invaded by whoever wants it.,"Daario ruthlessly and pragmatically starts weeding out the sons of the harpy with specialized search and destroy teams but the iron bank secretly tries to bring slavery back by financing aid to the harpies. The former slaves, with greater numbers eventually outlast the former slavers willing to fight and the iron bank cuts their losses, but not before Daario’s name is given to the faceless god. He dies, abandoned by the only woman he ever truly loved, having spent the rest of his life from that point helping the liberated former slaves she told him to protect. She’s the one given monuments and credit in the histories for liberating the people. But he’s the one who did the bulk of the dirty work and stuck it out until the job was done. He’ll be just a footnote of the events to most people in the future but dedicated historians will know the true weight of his tragically beautiful sacrifice.",Don't ask D&D cuz they already forgot about it,"I like to think that Drogon went back and made his nest out of one of the pyramids, the slavers are too afraid to get close and the people worship him as their protector and bring him offerings.","After the events of the dragon pit, Daario decided it was too dangerous to allow guards to have their identities known.  He passed a new law that allows for all guards to wear masks while on duty.  Also, as a result of being a former slaver area, the governing body goes far in the opposite direction.  Reparations are demanded by former residents, which are known as ""Danydations"".  While the freed peoples are grateful, the Slavers are disgusted by this.  Former Harpies form a new group known as the ""Seventh Sons"".  The group discovered Dany's corpse and have used blood magic to replicate her scent, so that they may tame Drogon.  They have the agenda of capturing Drogon and ""restoring balance to the natural order of things"".","Former HBO writer here. Can confirm that the super cancelled season 9 was going to cover that issue. Remember that lady with the mirror face? Well, she takes off her mask and it turns out to be a clone of Danny that Tyrion made in the future and had sent back in time to kill the Danny that destroyed King’s Landing but the purple lip wizards got the clone first and put the mirror mask on her. Any who, she assumes control after cloning an army of dinosaurs which she thinks she can control by selectively breeding the dinosaurs to be all female...","Something stupid and nonsensical, like in Westeros.",Don’t care. Waiting for the books to end it,"I like your post because this never ocurred to me, I never once thought about what happened there again.  You just sort of assume everything was fine, but knowing the city I doubt it would be","Nothing good happens I would wager. Daario was kind of only interested in doing what he was doing for Dany. With her gone, Daario has no motivation to rule using her principles. He will either fall to other slavers or will become a slaver himself. Slavery has been a constant in Slaver's Bay for ages. A couple of years of violent freedom will not change that culture. 

Daario may have some experience in leading an army but he isn't exactly a diplomat. Dany had him, Tyrion, other advisors, and dragons to cover all fronts. With basically just Daario and maybe a few people he trusts it wouldn't be enough to hold a free Slaver's Bay. Daario does know a lot about violence, but you can't rule free people with violence.","Once word reaches Essos of Dani’s death, the Masters will take back control. Yes, the Unsullied sailed to Naath to liberate the slaves there, but their numbers are severely depleted.","Daario seems to seek the good deal more than everything.

He has no reason to fulfill the dreamed society of Dany especially if it put him in danger. Either the slavers make a deal with him to bring back their power while he keeps ruling Mereen, either they see him as a traitor and he robs as many gold as he can and flee to a life with no troubles.","Daario governing Mereen was probably no better than Robert being king of Westeros, only Daario didn't have Jon Aryn to at least *attempt* to guide his decisions.

When he heard that Dany had died, he either...

Became a violent drunken mess and took full control of Mereen as a ruthless emperor, or he just packed up and abandoned the city all together. Depends how hard he took Dany's death or whether he even cared to begin with.","\*Starts chanting\*

Spin-off!

Spin-off!

Spin-off!","There was a season 8?

Must have been a fan fic, because I'm pretty sure GoT stopped after 6 seasons.",Honestly amazes me that people care after the bad taste season 8 left...,They all just ceased to exist as they were no more than afterthoughts at this point.,"Turned into a war zone or a lawless zone I'd say. Each city had a huge power void, Dani left with her dragons, dothraki and unsullied and then there were barely any masters left and the ones that do remain most likely lost most of their slaves. The second sons have 500 members, that's nothing even for a city guard, Daario probably didn't enjoy that power especially without Dani and then if or when he finds out she died then he's just doing for no reason. Dani held the bay with fear and her enemies lacking the power she had like 100k Dothraki, few 1000 unsullied, few hundred second sons and 3 dragons at the time, her army was probably the strongest and largest in the world excluding the army of the dead.",Are humans,Daario and the Second Sons took every valuable thing they could get their hands on and fled before The Sons of the Harpy or some other pro-Slavery/anti-Dany group rises up and either creates a united Ghiscari slaver empire or collapses the region into a state of constant war that'll last a generation.,Back to business,I love Daario so I hope he somehow managed to stay in power in Meereen.,"Totally destroyed, just like the show after season 6",Just absolute Chaos,"I would continue the story by having Dany's body returned to the Dothraki. She survived the fire, perhaps she could return from the sword. And as we all know, being dead wasn't necessarily the end for a lot of other characters. Once she returned to health, Drogon led her to more dragon eggs (or perhaps produced some himself - who knows dragon physiology?) which she raised. As Mother of Dragons she grew into immortality and traveled to right her wrongs.  (Well, a girl can hope)",People kind of forgot about the bay of dragons.,Don't care.,"Swept under the rug

&#x200B;

I don't think D&D want us to think about that. But I have a fanfic where Queen Seylse faked her death went back to house Flourent  and took control of Dragons Bay.

It wouldn't be hard for those in power or with money to overthrow the current government.  Hell they could probably even just take over and slowly add back in slavery but only for certain reasons or only a certain type of people can become slaves.  They just need to find someone that's a different color and convince people that they're less human and bam, slavery is acceptable again.","Like 99% of game of thrones, it meant nothing.

Like, maybe the locals ""forgot"" they existed. And Arya just circumnavigates like ""What the fuck""

Huh, that's actually a bit fun to consider. Instead of laziness, what if a lot of the stuff we hated happened because of plot convenient brain damage, like how Tyrion and Varys are just like, hypoxia-ed out all the time.

I always wanted the confirmation that he let everything go to shit, was a dictator, or simply left. 

This is one of those things that when people argue the later Dany reveal that she only cared about conquering and blood and never really cared about people came out of nowhere clearly proves this was always the intention of George RR Martin with the showrunners simply having no talent in being able to write without direct source material.",She said there will be instructions left for him and that the people will choose amongst themselves how to govern Meereen. From my memory of it,Dany kinda forgot about Mereen.,oh you mean like how >!Jon being Aegon Targyeron!<  meant literately nothing to the overall plotline?,Imagine the last shot being Dany lying on a table and taking her first breaths a la Jon Snow,Oh shit. I somehow forgot resurrection is a thing in GoT.,Who loved her in Mereen besides Daario? Everybody else was trying to kill her & her posse. Even the slaves turned on her after she executed that one guy.,"To me, they should have had Jon refuse an order from her to do something terrible or step in to stop her.  She goes crazed and wild and orders drogon to burn him.  Either drogon does and Jon is unharmed, like her and becomes the new unburnt or drogon refuses.  Dany goes completely crazy and attacks Jon with a knife.  In defending himself the blade turns in and she impales herself on it.  She turn lucid and back to her “good” self and looks at Jon.  She apologizes and charges him with being a good king and she dies.  

Maybe that’s too happy for GoT, but I think that ending makes a ton of sense and fulfills the plot in a way that the story lends us to.","But I think resurrection thing was valid only before the purpose is served.

But yeah those instructions will surely keep him and his men loyal to the cause, even after her death. Big time.

They are a city full of motivated people with low expectations, who know how to do almost every job in the city, since they were the ones doing it.  And the amount of crime will be very low, because I doubt many people start a life of crime immediately after being freed as a slave.

They would likely have a significant honeymoon period where things would work just fine, and they would have ample opportunity to refine whatever form of governance they want.  It would take a concerted effort by a major outside player to destabilise the city.",Nah it’s the fact that he didn’t want to smash anymore.,"Dany could have easily gone mad without Jon being Aegon though.  Varys was already plotting against her because she was going crazy before the whole Aegon Targaryen thing came to light.

And Dany going mad king all over king's landing would have made Jon change allegiances, with or without a claim.

The whole story could have left that whole plotline out and it would be largely the exact same thing, and everything would still make sense (Except I guess the whole ""It's out of character for Ned to have a bastard son"" plot).","God dammit, I wish you guys would stop sharing these cool ideas. Just when I think I can’t hate season 8 any worse, here comes something that fires me up all over again lol","Also, Jon should have been able to warg with the dragons.  There was obviously something to him being a northerner and of winter and also of the valerians which were all fire.

I’ll have to find it again.","Like in sports, sometimes it's good to have a trick up your sleeve, some deception in a play.

In addition, his knowledge is correct, and he knows with certainty exactly what will happen, it's not rumors or the other team claiming they will do something, he knows exactly what they will do and can fully commit to any counter strategy.

Just think, he would never need to station troops to maintain watch or needlessly defend long battle lines.  He knows exactly where every battle will take place, and exactly where the enemy is weakest.  If an enemy commander has food poisoning and out of commission, or a key defensive point is weak and needs maintenance, he knows exactly where and when that happens and can take full advantage by committing his full army wherever it is needed, and not wasting time positioning soldiers in remote areas to defend a place that will never be attacked.",Unlimited Intel isn't useful if Bran's only interested in taking the crows out for a joyride when there are important things to attend to.,"It would be a mere matter of knowing which master would need to die or who needs to be bought.

There is something in common with all slaves.  You have nothing.  The only way to have anything is to steal or take it from someone.  This behavior is learned.  Once freed it is very difficult to not fall back on this behavior.","Of all the things in Westeros, the key thing that took down the NK, and the thing the NK himself was most scared of was the 3ER.

Usual choices are : end of season 4 or end of season 6. My personal one is season 8 episode 2 (just before the Long Night).

The other day I found myself telling someone that hadn't watched it (they exist!) That I don't actually think it's worth getting into cause the end is so disappointing.  Maybe that's extreme, but a major part of any story/journey is the end.

Also I can't stand the whole ""you can't make everyone happy"" bit. It's not about me not liking the ending (though I can't lie, I didn't), it's about how poorly they treated the story, how smart characters became idiots, and how they threw major character development out the window.  It was just so badly written and rushed, they treated their audience like morons.  The writing was terrible.

I try to think, that even though I hated the last 2 seasons, it's mostly the writing I couldn't stand. The acting,  set design, costumes, music, etc were still superb. Though it kinda makes me sad that so many people worked so hard on it and did such beautiful jobs just to get to where we got to.


I agree what some other people said here. Take it as a lesson as not to get to invested in something you can't control. It's a hard lesson and I know people think I'm being ridiculous because it's just a tv show, but I cant help it.","Take it as a learning experience.

Our tour guide revealed a while into the tour he was a wildling chief in later seasons. Visiting the places from the show and hearing his input on it was so therapeutic and honestly made me want to watch again. Someone brought up the last seasons and we got his candid take on it, and honestly knowing what went on really helped me not care so much about the story and really love the show for what it was. He did talk about how the internet was hard on some stuff my favorite line was ""we spent 11 weeks filming this at night working insane hours and actually fighting for our lives on the show. People that died early spent the remainder of the shoots laying in mud and horse piss, and many people quit or walked off because of the conditions.

I will always appreciate them for their work; they’re likely just as disappointed as the rest of us with the culmination of their work, as not only “employees” but as fans.","You need to watch “The Last Watch”!  It is a behind the scenes episode that HBO made specifically for the fans. I hated the ending, but the behind the scenes episode really made me appreciate the entire series as a whole and all the hard work the characters put into it- bad or not-! It will help you understand why they ended it the way they did. A lot of people didn’t watch this episode because they were so burnt by season 8, but for me, I was not a huge fan of the show until after I watched the behind the scenes episode! I even had a jacket embroidered that looks exactly like the one Kit received behind the scenes. People complement me on it all the time and I wear it everywhere.

It’s a TV show who cares, not everything in life works out and a tv show ending poorly doesn’t ruin the whole show. You should be rewatching it with your wife because it’s what she wants to do and it’s what makes her happy.

Shit happens man, better off a show ends poorly than something way more severe in life occurring. Hope you find some peace though I guess, kinda sucks seeing that people are actually letting this get to them like this","Depends on why you hate S8. Do you like the story, but not the execution, i.e. it'll probably be better in the books. Or do you hate the story as well. 

If you hate the story and the events that happen then really you are hating GRR Martin's story and not DD's botched interpretation. At that point I don't think anything will help you. Maybe go look for some videos or commentaries on why the story is good. I quite like it how Martin just murders the whole concept of prophecy and fate. 

The prequels takes place in a very different time and should be much more ""war of the roses"" -esque like the first seasons of GoT are. There were no white walkers or emergent magics or whatever. It was just an exceptionally bloody civil war. They will also use Sapochnik as one of the directors and imo he's one of the best from GoT.",Just let it go dude.... let it go.,Honestly how did so few not see that ending coming?

Once the prequals come out I'll watch them but if I'll enjoy them remains a mystery to me.","I mean I think it’s good to realise that even though a lot of these things will probably happen in the books, they will get to those points in a much more cohesive and poetic way. Jon denying the throne is such a poetic and beautiful thing after the Targaryens have bought fire and blood to Westeros for 300 years but the script of season 8 even made that just feel boring and annoying. Basically his only line all season was nah dunwannit.","I'll give a slight correction on the other suggestions. You can read the books to distract yourself but there's only one real answer. 

Read *better books.* 

ASOIAF is not currently worth anyone's additional attention. There are better, more fleshed out, more complete, more interesting series worthy of everyone's attention. Grrm doesn't deserve the continued adoration and support when the man hasn't shown up to work in eight years. I've been a part of the ASOIAF community for 20 years. At this point? Fuck it and fuck George for failing in the most spectacular fashion. You're better off reading virtually anything else.","It's just a show at the end of the day.  At Thanksgiving someone brought up the season, and it opened up all the new wounds.  I went on a rant about all the flaws of season 8. It kind of made me laugh, because I had forgotten about it. But once the crack was opened, The Floodgate poured out again.",Don't you have real problems in your life?,"As someone who loved and still loves the franchise, I've found it to be fairly easy to accept what we got. While the final season isn't what we had hoped for or what the series deserved, the hate is still blown hugely out of proportion. The main issue stems from the short episode count and trying to cram 2 entire plots into 6 hour-long episodes. This resulted in rushing in between plotlines and coming up with sloppy and unbelievable reasoning for why things happened. For me, factoring out the rushing, the ending is still pretty decent, as are the character arcs people claim were ""ruined"". The problem is that they took a leap and there was no buildup to said endings or character development, it all kinda just happened over the course of 1-2 episodes. Use your imagination and fill in the blanks yourself. It's not perfect, but as far as first world problems go, it's certainly not the worst thing going on.

PS - I'm personally fine with Jon's true heritage not meaning anything. He's a Stark through and through, I don't expect him to change up his entire character and pursue the throne just because he's half dragon. The conflict was entirely Dany's problem because he was more loved and had a better claim to the throne (which you could say contributed to her madness), and Varys planned on exploiting that claim but again, we rushed through all of that which is why it feels like it wasn't as big of a deal as it should've been.","This was never going to be the best show off all time and it was painfully clear when GRRM couldn't finish his own story. 

How do we expect D&D to finish GRRMs story when the guy can't do it himself cause of how absurdly complicated he made it. 

I still enjoyed the show for the work of it. Cinematography, sets, design in general, its a beautiful show and even when compared to the first half where the story is expanding, it's still an average show.","I'm not over it neither. It was my favorite show on earth, even though I love the books as well, I only read them once, and I've rewatched the show every year before the new season premiere. I thought it would be a tradition to me to always watch it once a year, but I can't watch it anymore. Specially because I don't want to give a single penny to the writers. That's who I'm mad at.

I can't wait for the next books and for the prequel, but only because they are not being written by those two morons. But GOT, never again. And it makes me sad. I told all my friends to watch it, now I say I'm sorry and never watch it. The last season really made me so mad. Not because Jon killed Dany, but because of everything. Arya. The Night King. Bran. All the freaking Lannisters. Everything was so poorly written and rushed that it makes me sick to my stomach. Total lack of respect to the actors work and to the fan base, who spent money to watch it. Even HBO was disrespected. But as a network, they could have said something... Anyways. I get you.","A question about what you thought was the ""best reveal"" in the show... Jon's lineage is incredibly important, as it's what eventually drove the later drama between him, Dany, and his sisters.

Yes it’s not spectacularly capped off correctly but GoT is still the greatest show to ever hit TV and probably will finish that way.

I feel like if there was no books from the get go then the final season would have been looked at a little better.

Chernobyl got us through some of the s8 hurt :(,"I said before season 7 that I'll wait until the whole show has finished so I can buy the complete box set on blu-ray. I am now reluctant to do so because of said disappointment.

Look on the bright side though... 10 seasons in and TWD is still crap.",Try watching LOST or Battlestar Galactica (BSG).  The disappointment from the tail ends of these shows helped train me for GoT season 8.,Play the Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings II and create your own ending.,"Learn to laugh at and even embrace the bad (look at the SW prequels' resurgence over time) and enjoy the good. That's how I've remained a Star Wars, Star Trek, Indiana Jones, James Bond, Lord of the Rings, Matrix, Lost, Terminator, Predator, Alien, Die Hard, Keanu Reeves, and franchise fan in general after decades of oppressive disappointment

That being said, I still feel exactly how you feel about Thrones. You'll come back to it when you're ready, can't force it. Maybe when you forget about your own expectations for it and can watch it again for what it is and enjoy it more. Like how 20 years later, I suddenly decided, I kind of might like Phantom Menace now","I used to rewatch the first 6 seasons quite often. Since 7 & 8 the show has never crossed my mind and any desire to see it again has gone.  
You should just call it for what it is and find something new to fill the space.  
Every Generation has this happen. Bobby Ewing in the shower, Fonzie jumping the shark...this is yours.",I have had the hardest time starting new shows or being invested in anything. I’ve read the books and loved the show. Now I just watch reruns and YouTube cause any new show will likely disappoint in the end. I’m right there with you.,Start reading the Wheel of Time.,"I just stopped thinking about the show in general. It was a great ride with a terrible ending, it is what it is. Unfortunate.","I'd have to question how much you actually like the show to have such a disdain for the parts you like and to be unable to watch a prequel done by different people and actors. Maybe the final episodes made you realize you only watched the show to see the ending, and having such a ending ruins the whole franchise for you?

Or maybe it's not as big a deal? Or at least no one besides yourself can put aside bad feelings you have to enjoy something you say you deeply love?",I loved it.,It’s a tv show. Get over it.,"Dude, how did you end up married being this whiny. Are you the nagger of the family. Grow some balls and get over it. What I’m tired of is the entitled little you know whats still complaining about S8. It’s a god damn tv show, it was meant to entertain you, not rule your life. Now, I hope this helps. You’re welcome!","I’m sorry, but I don’t have sympathy any more. Get a life, go outside, pick up a book (different series.) IT IS A TV SHOW. Get over it. Stop complaining.",The ending season was so weak now I can no longer recommend the series to people who have not seen it.,Grow the fuck up,[removed],How would one be ironically hurt by this?,It’s a TV show.  Get a fucking life.,Last season was kinda like the last season of Scrubs. But all in all it was a great show.,"You were deeply wounded by the way in which a make believe story was ended as a TV show? 

Your wife thought the ending was fine, and now your on here attempting to mount evidence for your own case? Idk man just give it a rest. “Intensely sad and deeply wounded” LMAO",Books,Reading the books help,"I still like to imagine it's simply unfinished. It's a mystery ending and it always will be. It doesn't feel finished. It still feels like if you've read all the books and you're just waiting on the last one and it's not coming. I think I'm okay with that. One of my favourite authors wrote a great story and it's left unfinished. I'd love to see how it ends but since he's busy with other projects, it is just likely to be left in limbo. I'd prefer that, to something that was rushed garbage. I'm a huge thrones fan. I've traveled to Ireland almost exclusively to see filming locations. Let's just pretend that it was never finished.","I decided the best thing would be to get some distance from GoT and think about something else for a while, so I asked people to recommend TV shows with story arcs that ended well, and watched those.

Since GoT ended, I've seen all of the following on Netflix:

*Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood*:
a Japanese anime with a well-developed fictional world with history and interesting characters with different semi-magical powers and a good long-form story arc.  50+ episodes, about 20 minutes each.  Sticks the landing.  

*The End of the F---ing World* (should be stars instead of hyphens but I don't know how to format that), live action set in present-day UK, about two teenagers who don't seem to fit in and can't figure out what to do about that and run away, into a big bunch of trouble.  16 episodes, about 20 minutes each.  Doesn't appear to be ended, strictly speaking, but what they've got so far works well.

*Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*, live action set in present-day USA (West Covina, California, to be precise), a musical comedy/drama about a brilliant but deeply troubled woman who imagines emotionally-intense moments around her as musical numbers from Broadway shows; they wrote 157 songs over the four years of the show.  Swings from ""make you lol"" to ""make you cry"" and back again, sometimes in a span of seconds.  Treads the line of giving you characters you like who do some awful things, but showing you their struggles to keep you on rooting for them.  They don't always thread that needle perfectly, but they do more often than not.  The creators outlined the final scene, and wrote the last line of dialogue, before the series premiered, and it ends perfectly, exactly the way they intended.",I just watch LOTR,"Simple answer from me is that I won’t. I packed up the DVD’s and that’s the end of that. The book Universe is a separate thing for me so I will still enjoy that, but the tv series just ended so badly. Not the concept, I had an idea that this is where the story was going, but it’s implementation was terrible.","I used to binge watch the show a lot. If I couldn't decide what to watch, I'd watch Game of Thrones. Since the ending I haven't rewatched a single episode and I'm still upset how it all came to an end. 
Then I picked Fire and Blood and immediately fell in love with it. I went and bought every other book also. I'm currently reading A Feast for Crows and I've got to say; literally EVERYTHING is better in the books. If you loved the show, I dare say you will love the books also. Probably even more!","As a lover of Lord of the Rings and fantasy genre in general, I quickly became intensely invested in the show. I thought the tragedy throughout the show and the continual mettle displayed by many of my favorite characters such as Jon, Tyrion, Arya, etc. was so relatable. I felt a sense of true encouragement. As a political historian, the politics of the show intermingled with the “magic” of the world was a brilliant combination. Going into S8, I was ready for so many payoffs that didn’t come. Jon’s resurrection was rendered pointless. Dany didn’t even become the heroine that the show lauded for years. Tyrion’s brilliance was cast aside. And the main antagonist changed THREE TIMES in THREE EPISODES. It felt lazy and artless. It’s hard to watch any of the previous seasons knowing that none of the intrigue, mystery, or lore amounts to anything special. My advice: read the books or switch to Amazon’s LOTR series coming out soon or the wheel of time series.","The way I feel about it is, a bad REAL ending is better than a Sopranos ending, or “it was all a dream.” I think if the books are actually finished it will flesh out the show ending. Everything was just so condensed the last season.","I feel this, game of thrones was like me and my husbands thing for so long and now its done and sucked on the way out. We have gotten into playing wizards unite together over the summer but now that its getting cold going out all the time to play has changed into a chore as well. I guess we still watch rick and morty but its not really the same.","I’ve been an aspiring novelist for a couple years now. Even though I’m a huge fan of the show and read the books, but I’m also a huge fan Stephen King and Dan Brown, so I had trouble picking a genre to write in. However once I witnessed the nonsensical mess that was Season 8, I thought to myself, “I could write a better fantasy story than this!” And that’s when I decided that I would make my mark as a writer of epic fantasy.

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.",The Witcher will save us all,"Nothing we can do to change the horrific nature of the past. What you can do is never watch a single thing those two cunts write, produce or direct again. Make them a cautionary tale of how ignoring your job gets you blacklisted from the industry for life.","Bought all the seasons up to season 7.  I loved going back and watching them to see what I thought were little clues to possible endings etc.  

Turns out that I have zero reason to ever rewatch them with anyone again.  

I loved getting people into the series and being able to provide background info if they needed it.  Now it doesn’t matter though.  The prequels don’t matter and the spin offs won’t matter either.  It’ll all be on name alone but not substance.  

It was the worst ending to a long running series in television history and they’re just gonna have to own that.","I absolutely loved GoT. It was by far my most favorite thing in the world. The soundtrack was also a massive inspiration for me. It allowed me to take the necessary steps to greatly improve my music.

Season 8 killed my interest completely. Before S8, I rewatched the entire series like 9 times or something. I have not re-watched any of it since S8. I just stopped caring. I don't even have any interest in the prequels. 

I believe that S8 was so bad that it sunk the franchise. The ""Game of Thrones Forever"" plan that HBO has probably won't work now that a huge percentage of people completely lost interest.

It's just like you said. Everything eventually leads to the ""plotlines"" in S8. I wouldn't care about a Long Night prequel if I know that eventually the Night King, after doing nothing for the entire GoT series, dies instantly with no real impact on the story. He didn't matter in GoT, so why would he matter in a prequel.

I'm completely in the same boat as you. I basically just never think about it anymore. S8 was so bad that it makes the Star Wars Prequels look amazing.

I'd take Anakin Skywalker eating a CGI pear over coffee cups, water bottles, crashed plotlines, and an entirely meaningless story any day.","You don't move on. You hold a grudge and let the hate fester. For when it is time to meet D&D in battle, they will be met with the fury of an entire season!!",Realized nothing can beat breaking bad,"The way i see it, if you eat your favorite food 8 times, and one time its made badly, do you give up on that food for good? GOT is a great show in its entirety even if season 8 wasnt the best. I still adore the show and am very excited for the prequels. You kinda just have to accept that whats done is done.","You don’t. Sadly, I tried a rewatch and just couldn’t because what’s the point.","I feel for you, but I don’t know if this problem is fixable. Perhaps it is time to just move on to another franchise and let this one go.","My gf cheated on me at a party/group viewing of the series finale.


So now I guess im not so upset about what D&D did 🤷‍♀️","Honestly, after the dumpster fire that was Season 7, the final season just didn’t hurt me as badly as it seems to have hurt everyone else.  

Now, don’t get me wrong, I hated it.  But I had basically already given up on the show by then.  

Season 5 (the Dorne storyline primarily) was the first time the cracks really started to show, but I’m one of those people who will always stick up for Season 6.  Despite its many flaws, I thought S6 was still mint GoT, especially the latter half of the season.

But S7...my god....that was when I truly gave up all hope.  And it shocked me that so many people were still excited for S8, so I guess it’s not surprising that I was already numb by the time the last 6 Eps rolled around.","Also, fuck D&D.","As a book reader first and foremost I have to VEHEMENTLY disagree with the advice to ""read the books"". I am in the same position as you and I have been this way for **8 years**, a newbie in terms of suffering in the ASOIAF universe. Since the last book that was any good came out 20 years ago.

What has helped me is kind of think of the show and the books as unfinished and just enjoy the story up to Book 3/Season 4, I feel like the narrative in both really fell apart after these points. Afterwards it ""jumped the shark"". So I still enjoy the beginning very much!

Maybe in your case watch the prequels with your wife and when doing a rewatch of GoT, just sort of become...less invested...after it starts to get unbearable and redirect attention to The Witcher, the Mandalorian, or something else actually worth watching.","You don’t. At least I’m not going to. You don’t owe anyone anything. I don’t watch Dexter nor will I rewatch it despite loving the first few seasons.

Same with Game of Thrones. It’s a story built on leading to a conclusion. I don’t care how enthralling the stories were to get there if I already know it’s leading to a very terrible end I can’t enjoy the ride and I don’t think I should force myself to.","I didn’t mind the ending. Many of the character arcs ended as I expected. My issue is solely with the pacing. The last two seasons should have been stretched over four or five seasons. What made GoT great was the dialogue, the slow build up, the journey. Season 7 and 8 were simply rushed.",You can’t. The last season has ruined the entire show for me. I can’t watch the other seasons cause in the back of my head I know what it leads to and it’s pointless.,"I am also deeply saddened by the intense drop in quality. I loved this show and this story and these characters and DnD let everyone down. I miss the tension of seeing your favorite character in trouble, or the majesty of seeing Drogon flying into a scene. I think Season 7 and 8 are so bad that I'll never watch the show again.

The lesson here is to not get too wrapped up into a story that you have no control over. Roll with the punches and cut your losses. There are a lot of good stories out there!","Regarding all the negative people telling you to stop whining etc, ignore them. Im in the same boat as you. Read the books before the show came out. Loved it. Re read them once season one came out. Loved the show so much. Got behind all the theories, it was so cool.  Season 6 ending was the BEST part for me. Amazing build up, incredible soundtrack, dany FINALLY heading to Westeros, the show was beyond the books... so much promise.. 

..... 
and then Season 7 was like “WTF is this?” One liners, bad jokes, timeline issues, character dev died.. it was so bad

And season 8 left me in a state of grief. I just... hated it. 

I hear ya and i honestly dont know how to move forward.  :(",I’ve already forgotten this show.,Waiting for the Witcher on Netiflix. If it does any justice to the books and games it’ll be better than GoT,"I was a huge fan having read the first few books long ago then rediscovering the series after hearing the show was coming out.  From the very first episode I was all in and so optimistic (dumb) thinking Martin would catch up.  That slowly faded into pessimism and I had already convinced myself that the show story was not the same story as the books after they ran out of material to prepare myself for the disappointment.  The ending still hurt a lot.

To ease the pain I jumped on the Wheel of Time hype train and started a re-read before the Amazon Prime series starts up next year.  Like with any love, you can’t feel the highs without the lows so you have to put yourself out there again!",It’ll take time. Like fans of Lost and Sopranos who didn’t like how they ended. Time = acceptance = forgiveness,"Same as you. I still can’t believe they shit on so many themes that defined the characters for 7 seasons.

What I did was I turned to transformative works aka fanfiction. With so many fans left unsatisfied with the conclusion, it inspired a lot of people to write their own endings of GoT and there are some seriously amazing works out there.

Edit: I disagree with some of the people here saying you shouldn’t invest yourself too emotionally on a series etc. If you didn’t invest so much of your interest, *you wouldn’t have enjoyed yourself so much in the first place.*

How else can someone stand to read through pages upon pages of lore and history? How else can you justify spending hours on end in forums theorizing on what happens next or what the symbolism and themes imply? How can you justify spending hard earned money on stuff that does not hold any intrinsic value?

I say invest your heart out. Getting hurt is part of life, and distancing yourself just so you can avoid it sounds absolutely silly to me. If you don’t put your heart into it, you’ll miss the times when a series does finally come to a satisfying conclusion like in Harry Potter or LotR.","I was disappointed too.  It was rushed.  Dany became everything she hated, but her turn wasn't believable to me.  I started out as one of the most amazing stories. I loved all the intrigue and scheming characters in the beginning.  It ended a turd. The way they handled the white walkers was a turd.  S8 was garbage. It is hard to watch most modern movies/TV if you are a critical thinker. They rarely make sense and the action scenes are often complete BS.  


That said it is just a TV show and I think you are placing too much importance in a fantasy show that should be reserved for your real life.","I read fan fictions, they have better endings. Truly, give it a shot.","Just here to say that I feel the same way. I’m not feeling outraged anymore, just profoundly sad about it. When Daenerys went Mad Queen, my heart just broke. When Bran and Sansa were left to rule while Jon was exiled, I felt inconsolable. It hurts to know that the years of emotional investment in this story and these characters was all building towards nothing. Just a senseless, careless conclusion that completely disregarded the previous seven seasons. Completely disregarded the story’s lore in favor of the mainstream. Truly I’m still sad about it. I haven’t rewatched any GOT since I saw the finale. But I will try to focus on the years when GOT was good and be grateful for seasons 1-6, even 7, and just accept that sometimes things don’t pan out how you want them to. 💔",Its a fucking tv show...a....tv....show....come on man,"I mean. It's just a show. It blew it but it's just a show, get over it..","By realizing it’s not your show,you don’t own it and you had no part in creating it so get over it.","Just forget about the show.  It's all tainted now.  Like many other shows they blew it in the final season. Here's a list of great shows with HORRIBLE final seasons

True Blood

The Sopranos

Dexter

Scrubs

Battlestar Galactica

How I met your mother","Man, I feel the exact same way. I’ve never felt so betrayed by writers in my entire life. And especially so they could start a project that now they’re not even doing? So it was all for nothing? The whole thing infuriates me to no end. I’ve wanted to rewatch it again but feel exactly the same - what’s the point when I know how horribly it ends? It feels like it’s changed the show in its entirety for me. So unbelievably disappointing.","I have not and probably will never recover from the atrocity of S8. The show overall has been ruined for me entirely because many of the main story arcs that are built upon from S1 - S7 are basically disregarded or handled extremely bad in S8 that if I was to try and rewatch the show again, I will just lose interest knowing the outcome. This is the only show that legitimately makes me angry because I invested so much time and attention to it. I even convinced dozens of friends/family to watch the show and now I am embarrassed that I talked it up so much all these years.",Rewatched seasons 1-4 then shut it off and moved on.  Terribly disappointed with how haphazardly so was thrown together.,Stopped watching GOT.,"I used to rewatch GoT regularly, but after S8, I have not watched a single episode. Final season totally  ruined it for me.","I keep wanting to re-watch GoT but that final season always stops me... really unfortunate, I used to view it as the best show ever, but now because of the last season, everything seems bad.","Also super serious, but that whole franchise is fucking dead to me. If HBO allowed that last season to happen there's no way I'm investing my time and emotions into it again. I guess the difference between us is that I'm honestly not even interested in getting back into it. If you're into  books (that's how I got over GoT) you may want to consider reading The Wheel of Time series, it's a cool fantasy series that does, in fact, have an ending. The ending was written by a different author after the original author died, but it's really good.","Lies. They can come in handy. I lied to myself that what happened didn't happen. I rewrote s8 in my head & just pretended the stupid away.

Sort of like ""La la la la... I can't hear you."" That's what I did to s8.

And remember the good stuff. The good was still big fun.","Jon is Targaryan. Yes, it has revealed. But we shouldn't focus on that it didn't mean anything. So, how they should use the information that he is Targaryen? He should become a king of 7kingdoms? I wanted it, but it is not Martin's ending. D&D tried to show how there left 2 Targaryen loving each other, where one of them should kill another one for the good of the realm. And how that one will become no one at the end going beyond the wall, leaving his story. The story how he was a bastard. Wanted to be a Stark. Knew that he is a Targaryen at the end.","How do you move on??? It's a TV show not a dead family member, grow up.",Omg grow up it's a fucking tv show. Show us on the doll where they hurt u,It's a fucking show. Get over it.,Hit puberty.,"Time.  And I immediately watched the entire series again, including that last, especially awful one, and I hated it less because I knew what to expect maybe.

It was easier to enjoy the happy ending some of them still got.  Like Greyworm and his remaining men, on their way to Messande’s home island, to protect her people from slavers in the future, even though he couldn’t save her.

I’m planning on reading the last book when it comes out too and I’ll do my best to replace that ending with the series finale in my head.","She thinks the ending was fine?
Time to lawyer up and hit the gym, bro.",By realizing there are much more important things in life than a TV show.,You realize you're an adult and that you're moping about a fictional fantasy show. And beer. A lot of beer,I can't.  It's impossible.,"The entire show is built around subverting fantasy tropes. It would have been THE WORST POSSIBLE ENDING if Jon had become king. That's basically just taking years of work creating a world that doesn't play by normal trope rules, and throwing it all away for nothing. 

The way that the show arrived at the ending was somewhat rushed, and I wish they had given it more time, but the ending was the right one.",Jesus Christ. Grow up you fucking loser. It was a TV SHOW based on shit books that literally stopped being halfway decent at the end of season 4. What did you expect?,"it’s a tv show lmao, wow, seek help","Jesus Christ it’s a television show. Move on with your life. Go to work, eat some food, meet a friend. For fucks sake man.","You were enjoying a wonderful gourmet meal and when you were 6/8ths of the way through it, you bit into fried mouse.  Yes, your earlier bites tasted great, the service was excellent, but you need to accept that this was a bad dining experience.  Also, there was a power outage at the end and everything went dark.  And that was when the chefs were caught wiping their asses with the recipes/cook book left by the owner.",This is cringey as fuck.,Read the books or listen to the audio books. Dave and Dan can go f themselves,Lmaooooo,Having an actual life would be a good place to start.,Well I realized that I wasn't 5 years old and my life didn't revolve around an HBO tv show that I had nothing to do with...also read a book every once  in a while...it will do you some good to use your brain...,I started watching asoiaf videos again. That helped me get back into the lore again. I still don't have any interest in rewatching the show for a good while. But I'm definitely not as switched off as I felt post-show.,"It’s just a tv show remove yourself from the online aspect of the show and watch it for what it is not what it should could or might have been 

The online aspect to this show is now toxic with over critisim of every little thing wrong with the show now

Just remember no tv is perfect some get more right that others. A lot of tv shows peak in the early years then get gradually worse yet everybody can still watch those early years and enjoy them it’s the same with this show the problem here is the show was a huge worldwide event with major hype probably the first for a twitter based world now

People can now discover this show and watch it all in one batch which will be incredible for young people in the future when they discover this show no more anxious waiting a year in between or 2 in the case of season 8","For me the show ends after season 7 with the Night King bringing down the wall. 

I just pretend it ends and we’re left to fill in the gaps anyway we’d like.  Jon defeats the night king? Sure. Cersei ambushes the North while they’re fight the dead? Works for me.  The night king just wins and destroys everything outright? Why the hell not? Would have still been a better ending than season 8. 

The natural gap of a season ending and openness to interpret an ending anyway I want is comforting to me.  As far as I’m concerned season 8 doesn’t exist.","jesus christ it's a fucking show. it should not be ""hurting"" you nearly a year later. get some help",Just imagine the show ends with Season 6’s incredible finale And that someday after GRRM releases the final 2 books they will make a 3 movie trilogy to wrap up the final threads.

I don’t want morons writing adventures for me anymore, so I’m just doing it myself. It’s more time consuming but also worked wonders",I think you should read the books or listen to the audiobooks.  There’s soo much more to the GoT world in there and you know it doesn’t lead to season 8,"Search YouTube for ""GoT everything rewritten"" - there's a few different, more satisfying, endings that fans have made.","You said you only read parts of the books, so this may not be the strategy for you, but basically I’m not taking anything after season 4 as canon. To me, seasons 5-8 were fun fan fiction that had some good stuff in it (Hardhome, Battle of the Bs, High Sparrow) but ultimately it doesn’t count so I don’t need to get worked up over it. Season 8 still killed me, I literally cried from disappointment at the end, but it doesn’t count one little bit. The prequels will maybe count because George is going to take more of an active role in them (he’s learned his lesson) and they’ve mostly been written or they have an ending already. 

If that’s not what you can do, then just watch the parts that made you excited and don’t think about season 8. Like other commenters, watch up to S8E2 but that’s it. You’ll learn to forget about it eventually.",I love the series Chuck. It had great plotlines and superb cameos. I hated the ending. I will never watch the last season again because it breaks my heart. I haven't managed to rewatch it knowing how it ends. I still love it though as a whole.,Basically finding another show that I get to love as much as GoT. Watching Dark has helped me.,"So the first time I had this feeling was with a game, Mass Effect 3. Without going into details, the ending sucked from a logical and thematic point of view and left a fictional universe I'd grown up be deeply attached over many hours in an absolute wreck because of an unpolished, badly written ending.

Relatively speaking, GoT wasn't as bad for me because a) I saw the signs in S7 (frankly even as early as Dorne D&D exposed themselves) and b) the execution sucked but at least many of the broad plot points were okayish.

How I dealt with it was watching dissections of the ending and then also replaying the earlier games. That helped me remember why I loved it in the first place. Don't think about where it's going, but where it could have gone. In the end, I even rehabilitated the majority of the 3rd game which has its fantastic moments. But I will never replay the end.

So choose where the series ends and then head canon the rest or listen to alternate takes on YouTube if you struggle to come up with your own version. That way you can reclaim your love and over time you learn to just live with the ending and mostly ignoring it.",This was the only thing that helped me: https://youtu.be/G0mncEl4nVU,"I've been reading the books, and now I joined the army of fans waiting for the Winds of Winter to be released (WoW's Watch).

I have two alternating head canons:

1) Evcerything happens in Season 7 as normal and the firest three episodes of season 8.  Missandei grabbed Circe before falling, killing Circe and essentially ending the war.  

2) Season 7:  Danaerys eschews Tyrion's terrible advice about not using her dragons when she gets to Westeros.  She gets Varys to confirm that all of the leadership (Circe, et. al.) are in the Red Keep.  Danaerys uses her THREE dragons (because she didn't have to have one killed by the Night King in a stupid side quest) to destroy the Red Keep with Circe and crew in it.  She takes over Westeros and goes to fight against the Night King, etc. etc. which takes up all 6 episodes of season 8 and there is some resolution to some of the characters' arcs.","Shows are generally meant to last, not to end. GoT was different in that much of it was already written. However, it became like other shows once there was no written material to follow. So then you should choose to like the journey, not the conclusion. If it's endings you're after, movies are a much more effective medium. Most of my favorite TV shows went to shit when forced to wrap up. It's the rule, not the exception.","When I figure it out I’ll let you know. For now, I spend my time reading pro Daenerys stuff.","Heya, I feel quite the same way. I have lots of merchandise, collectors editions of most seasons, posters, banners, etc. I held Season Premiere and Season Finale parties started with like the end of season 2, where I cooked from the Game of Thrones cookbook. I went to Belfast to tour the studios, do the exibition, and go on Game of Thrones tours, meet the direwolves, etc. There was 3 GoT concert tours, I went to the show 4 times, going to another city to see it again one tour. 

Probably what's helping me the most currently is I am both reading the books and listening to the audiobooks. I'm not alternating, I'm literally doing both.  

What may have prepared me the most though, is I play alot of the Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings 2 /r/CK2GameofThrones - I've basically already lived out and played out soo many different endings and such, that I think I'm able to more easily just head cannon season 8 as another one of those different storylines that isn't really real.",You wait for the book to find out the real end. Then watch season 1-7 and just know the real s8 in your mind.,"When I rewatch the show I stop at season 6, and just imagine that we will know the true ending/what follows S6 once the book get released.",I know it was rushed for whatever reason. They could have pulled off the same ending had there been another season or two.  Everything in GoT built slowly through the first 5-6 seasons. The last 2 were so rushed we didn't get the same satisfaction. That's how I live with it anyways.,Just realize the show started going down hill a couple seasons before season 8 and wallow in that for a while,"I am re-watching GOT now and thoroughly enjoy it. Character and plot, all is well done. 

But I will skip season 8. For me, GOT is all about the characters and somewhere in season 7, the show runners lost all interest in them. They knew the big plot lines, but not how to put them together. Which is forgivable. 

They also did not hide their lack of interest in the characters and thought actors/ audience would not notice, which is quite arrogant.","I just won't watch it ever again to need to enjoy the show as a whole. It's not a show I care to revisit like I do with some of my favorite shows of the past- it was removed from that list after the finale.

I'm sorry it hurt you so badly.",Read the books instead of watching,The Last Kingdom on Netflix really helped.,Forget the show existed. Season 8 (and 7) killed it. Look forward to the rest of the books. :),"Instead of the abysmal plotting, focus on the production design efforts, i.e. the music, the aesthetic, the costume/prop/set design, vfx, scheduling etc. 

Behind the shit writers and executive decision-makers were teams of elite artists who did their jobs properly, utilizing immense budgets that pushed the limits of what TV storytelling normally allows. The music was stellar. The dragons were beautifully rendered. The acting, even in spite of the HORRENDOUS dialogue, was milked to peak capacity.

S8 annoyed me, too, but as an amateur filmmaker who has worked on set before, mediocre leaders can/will make mediocre production choices. You gotta find the silver lining. Don't let a show's weakest link overshadow the elements that actually worked.","I mean that shit was so bad I am actually really looking forward to the books now. The show was enjoyable while there was source material. Even though I only read up to a Feast for Crows, I thought I probably won't need to read through the remaining x thousands of pages. After the show started going off the rails(even before the last season), I started looking forward to reading the books again.","I watched Chernobyl. That was one of the most impressive shows I’ve seen. 

Plenty of good shows out there. GoT did hurt me deep, stayed loyal to the show as a fan and it cut me deep fam","I didn't hang my Iron Throne ornament on my Christmas tree this year, and I loved it so in years past.","Mate season 8 wasn’t the best but if you loved the rest of the show you should consider watching the prequels, as you do not know if you’ll like it","Weirdly, i'd suggest watching it from the beginning again. 
I didn't think I'd enjoy it knowing where it leads to, but the first few seasons are so stupidly strong that I started forgetting how bad things end up. I'd say give watching it again another go, see if you can switch the narrative in your head away from the negative end of the story to the extremely positive 6 or 7 seasons. 😊 Hope it works! If not idk watch the extended editions of Lord of the Rings or something. 🙃","It's still the same show you fell in love with. I rewatched the show again before S8 released and fell in love all over again, and you catch a bunch of small details now you know where the story leads. 

I'm slowly creeping my way through the book series to get my itch now as I have never managed to get round to reading them, and my hope is for the last books to fill the void that S8 left us.","I was thinking about this the other day, it's super depressing that the show fucked it up and George has given up writing the books.

One of the best stories and it's not going to get a good ending...",Idk...Star Wars has been pretty good lately.,"The Boys, The Mandalorian, and other shows that have come since. Game of Thrones isn't everything on TV. 

I enjoy season 1 still as it feels almost like an entirely different show. Most of what comes after starts to feel a bit hollow though.","Read the books, watch another show, and make a mental note to never be so emotionally invested in a TV Show again.","Try getting into a different but similarly vibed series. I just started the witcher series and I can’t recommend it enough for getting over GOT disappointment. I’m really, *really* enjoying it","Time, I think. My Christmas tradition is to boxset, bathed in the glow of my tree lights, but this year?? I just don’t want to. There’s so much to love, but I just can’t do it yet. I think I’m swearing off the show completely, and try to boxset next Christmas when it’s no so raw. I’ll be interested in how I feel then, maybe it won’t sting so much, but this year? No interest.","My advice would be to mitigate your expectations. Say “hmm, this is a tv show like matlock or Murphy brown. People write it and the actors shoot it. Then I buy it. One part of it wasn’t good. OH WELL there will be another show on in 20 mins”","I’ve actually taken pleasure in the Youtube community.  Several channels have published incredible ideas on how the show could have ended with detailed story descriptions that are far superior to what we got.  Why?  Because they are made by people like us, who have a passion for the lore and felt saddened by what we were given.

Hello Future Me has some great videos rewriting key elements of season 8.  If you want help venting your frustrations, can’t go wrong with MauLer, too.  While these creators have very different approaches, they both fairly criticize the writing of the series while proposing alternate paths to get the story to where it needed to and should have gone.","I'm not sure i'll move on from it.. I hated S8 overall right now, and I'll still be sad it had to end that way when I think about it when I'm old as shit.

I just judge the show in its entirety... S8 Ep4 to end sucked but that wont take away the fact that S1 Ep1 to S8 ep3 has MANY of the best memories I have watching Films and TV.

Remember how amazing it was when it was unveiled to us the story behind our boy Hodor? Or Jon snows parents? That awesome soundtrack playing while the camera was focused on baby Jon's droopy eyes the snaps into the eyes of Jon Snow being a KING in the halls of Winterfell? Or that scenes with Tywing and/or Ollena? Or that episode of The Mountain and The Viper. Or that shot where Jon was in a no-mans-land with Bolton cavalry rushing on to him.. man those where AMAZING..

I could go on all day about how many memorable moments this show had. And nothing can take that away from us.

To my eyes it's still the best TV show i've seen. I doubt it'll be dethroned soon. GOT set the bar REALLY high and will be the standard when it comes to fantasy fiction tv shows.",Read the books,"I haven’t really moved on. It’s a sore spot. I remember shortly after the end, a fella on Reddit wrote some ‘sequel’ short stories and it helped give people closure with the story and the characters. 

I watched seasons 1-7 at least 4 times. Season 8 I watched each episode twice except the last. 

The last episode I only watched once. And I haven’t been able to sit and go there that disaster again.",You dont,"I went deep into the lore and discussed many predictions for S8. They did a bamboozle. I scoffed at a GoT house banner while shopping yesterday. Who have I become? I don’t know, but I’m not holding my breath for anything GoT related anymore. Hype this hotpie dong","I’ll be honest, I’ve had a really hard time reconciling the rest of the series with how poor season 8 was. The contrast is so stark(pun intended) that it is hard to believe the same production team out it together.  So many stories  and character arcs were built in a very specific way and almost all of it was abandoned for the sake of expedience and/or laziness. This is a show that taught us that traditional writing and story telling could be turned on its head and still make for compelling entertainment. Then it just fell flat. I don’t know what to say except I have simply forgotten about season 8 and really ended it in my imagination the way I feel it should have been. Other than that I’m just waiting on Martin to finally publish this last book.","The ending of this show ruins everything that precedes it. Imagine edging for 7 years and then when it's finally time to get your nut, it just dribbles out like a pathetic little blob with no gusto behind it. That's what the ending was for me. I think most of us are going to describe this show to people to haven't seen it as, ""The show was great until the final season.""","You can’t enjoy the show, but you can read the books","What have you done all the other times this has happened in your life? (Genuine question.)

I've learned to ignore those copout endings and never watch them again. I'd prefer they never ended the story, so I decide that last movie or season or whatever doesn't exist.","maybe try replacing it?

I highly recommend Merlin, it didn't have anything like the budget GoT had (it's mid 00s BBC, expect cheesy writing and effects). it's got a medieval setting like GoT and the main cast are really likeable, also since it's made in the UK half the cast will be recognisable because a lot of them went on to be on GoT too. (just a warning, a lot of fans were somewhat disappointed by the way this ended too but it was nowhere near as bad as GoT and only the last episode or 2 rather than the last 2 seasons)

I'd also suggest just reading the books we have from start to finish to make that the version that is in your head instead of the show, then you can imagine that GoT prequel shows are prequels to the book continuity instead which might helpp. literally just throw out show canon and replace it with the book canon","Well i went through the same feeling for like 2 months or so. I couldn't think of anything else other than GOT. I tried watching some other series but it all went in vain. My friends were tired of my constant nagging about the show. But sometime after 2 months of the ending PewDiePie started his minecraft series and it seemed like a fun game so i tried it myself and i got so engaged it in that i slowly started caring less about GOT and more about other things like my studies, etc. And that's how i moved on from GOT. To be honest i am still on this sub because of my love for previous seasons and the memes. I hope it helps.","In the final analysis, I just want the story to rap up. Did I like the way it ended?  No. At a minimum, it needed 4 more episode to make some sense.  The whole story arc about the civilian population made no sense.  Nobles never cared about civilians other than as a tax base.","Back then, Chernobyl was also aired by HBO so I watched that to somehow ""clean my palate"". After that, S8 didn't seem too big of a deal.","I totally understand, even in YouTube vids like 'tywin lanister roasting people for ten minutes straight' the quality of the show comes through.  And that last season was just a huge steaming dump in the middle of a summers picnic.  I just can't watch it.  Find something else, anything!!","The show ruined it for me. There is no point in re-watching the series or even thinking about it for another minute. Nothing that happened in the previous seasons ended up mattering in later seasons, so all of the build-up meant nothing.

If the books come out, I'll enjoy them. Besides that, it doesn't matter anymore.",I disregard the last episode and pretend the show ended at 8x05.,Fanfiction therapy. Read them. Write them.

The last season broke me","I found the game The Sword, the Crown, and the Unspeakable Power, a tabletop game heavily inspired by GoT. My friends and I just played out the story like we wanted it to.","Everything that has a beginning, has an end. It takes an end to restart a new beginning.","Season 8 was so bad that I’ve basically wrote off the entire series. As someone who loves TV, analyzing/looking for meaning/theorizing about what will happen next, GOT was always my number one. Now I can’t even recommend the show to anyone because of how it ended. Yeah the first few seasons were great, but the last looks like HBO hired a $100 million CGI team and a five year old writer.",FanFiction,Read the books,"The books, after the disappointment of S8 the books were restored my faith.","Read the books, again...","I'll change the subject a little but. Back in the 90s there was a great series called animorphs. In that series the controversy is always the ending where spoiler everyone dies.  Now fans raved and hollered at how our ending was stolen. 
Applegate, the author wrote a reply which woke us up that these characters like those in got were doomed from the start. Not everyone gets a fairy tale ending even disney doesnt like dads",I just never bothered watching the final episode. Cant be a bad ending if I haven't seen the ending.,"I completely understand what you mean. I've bought plenty of merchandise over the years and my husband even mentioned he would have gotten me the complete set had it not ended so terribly. We're both still disappointed about it, I've read the books and he hasn't so that doesn't seem to matter. I'm also not confident that the books will ever be finished. The only advice I can give is to watch the first few seasons over and just pretend it ends after season 6 or something, that's what I intend to do if I can ever bring myself to rewatch.","I pretend like S8 didn’t happen. To me, the show ended after S7 and I make up a different ending in my head that actually makes sense and isn’t complete nonsense.",Watch the lord of the rings trilogy in one sitting.,"Move on with the knowledge that once in a generation shows come along... once a generation. There will likely be a new show out within 10 years that is just as good and maybe, hopefully, they won’t pork it up as bad as GoT.","I've moved on. We're still in a Golden Age of geek-centric TV/streaming. The Mandolorian is tremendous, I'm stoked for more Westworld next year, and I've heard great things about Watchmen. I'll read the books when/if they EVER come out, but I can't lose sleep over it. I won't lose sleep over it, life's just too short.","Okay, my advice is to take a deep breath and start quietly engaging with people who *did* like the show. Start small -- with people who were maybe a little meh but overall satisfied. Or people who had some niggling issues but in general would watch again. Start lurking in subreddits that are outside the s8 sucked silo. Get some insight into why people either liked or were satisfied enough with s8 to not feel the hurt you're currently feeling. 

Start letting go of what you expected the show to be and take a fresh look at what the show actually was. (Case in point: there was a massive conflict and reckoning that came out of Jon's birthright reveal. Just apparently not the conflict and reckoning you were expecting.) 

I'm not saying you need to move to a place where you like the show yourself. But getting to a place where you can treat it more like an intellectual exercise (what was it that others enjoyed and how does that kind of story just not work for me, was there anything I could have picked up on a little earlier to warn me that this was going to be that type of story, etc.) will help remove the personal and the passionate. And in its own way, that kind of dissection brings its own fun. (As long as it's dispassionate dissection.)","Definitely my first advice is to read the books. There’s SO MUCH more story in those books than 8 seasons of the show. 

After I finished season 8, I reread (audible listened) the books and have just started a rewatch through. I’m on season 5 and I can’t lie to you, it’s painful. Every CotF scene I say out loud “oh, remember how all of this complicated history leads to nothing?” Or similar with other arcs, like Jon fighting the WW, etc. 

However, a reread helped me rewatch the show and try to connect the threads a bit more in my head or develop side theories based off where I think GRRM might go with his storylines. 

It’s not pretty, it’s painful. I am still deeply, deeply hurt by what we have as the finale of this wonderful tv series, but read the books. There’s more.","Watch The Lord Of The Rings movie trilogy, extended edition. Nothing can ever top thoses movies, and you'll know that those can't ever be ruined and anything else you'll ever watch will never be as good as LOTR. Nothing can hurt you anymore if you assume that everything will be disappointing after LOTR",I think I need to find a support group or something.,"Reading the books doesn't help because they'll never be finished so you'll never get the proper ending. You could also move on to something else, like The Witcher. Reviews are positive & at least those books have an ending.",Jörgen Red Rectum Salazar?,Prequel has been cancelled.,I just deny to myself that season 8 ever happend.,Either read the books or move on with your life and don’t care about the show that ruined it,"This is the correct answer I think. 

I’ve experienced lots of media that doesn’t “stick the landing.” Lost, the Matrix Trilogy, GOT, Star Trek: VOY etc. It happens. Endings are hard, and while a good one can make what came before better, I don’t think a bad one makes what came before worse. 

They punted the finale, yes. But that doesn’t diminish incredible episodes like Baelor, Watchers on the Wall, Hardhome, The Door, Knight of the Seven Kingdoms and all the other greats.","I also hated the Mass Effect ending (red, blue, green, no choice whatever). Without those forced choices and only one ending, that would be great in my opinion. Or even better, if you could make those choices 3 or 4 hours before the ending... But all in all, for all the experiences I sincerely thank Bioware. I still remember those times with the crew. Im happy I got to know them, helped them, made some calibrations etc.",They did fix that ending to some degree and it was decent enough. I think my only complaint was you got to choose your ending of the 3. I wish you only got one ending if you were more than 75 percent renegade or paragon or you got the middle of the road ending.,Stephen King's Dark Tower series has an interlude before the ending asking the readers to stop if they can't understand that the destination does not define the journey.

People were shitting on it and calling it filler, but I thought it was one of the best episodes ever.

That was until the episode 3 which completely devalued it... To me episode 2 seemed like a proper farewell to most of those characters gathered around the fire. Instead they all survived with no issues and it was just a big fakeout episode that was designed to make us think they were going to die. It's like if your friend told you he has cancer. You start to get sad. Then he says ""haha naa just kidding"".

Take it as a lesson as not to get to invested in something you can't control. It's a hard lesson and I know people think I'm being ridiculous because it's just a tv show, but I cant help it.

This is pretty much the premise of stoic philosophy. You have control of nothing at all except how you feel about things so you should strive to be detached from all things.

I think it came down to realizing just how little D&D cared about stuff like character development & motivations, telling a good story and having the plot points make sense in the universe. They instead focused on making 'moments' for TV, cool one-off scenes that people will talk about the next day, regardless if they make sense for the characters or for the story as a whole.","Imo that just made me sad knowing all the actors and especially the behind the scenes crew did all that work during the S8 filming for possibly one of the biggest let downs in television history.

As a huuuuge HP fan growing up and an even huger fan of all things GoT, The Dark Tower is finally filling the void GoT ripped through my heart (and Harry Potter originally created by its simple act of not lasting forever).","I still can't believe how abruptly Dany was taken out.

After years of investment in a character to be wiped away without much of any suspense or noteworthy build up. Not to imply that she should have survived the show... But the execution was all wrong, imo.

As mentioned by many, the series of events that happened in S8 were on point... But it should have been teased out as opposed to rushed along. A good 4 more episodes could have salvaged this.

Ever major bad guy died abruptly in that show. Every major character died tragically. This show played out exactly how it was meant to. 

Not sure why people wanted 4 more episodes of filler. The cast had been whittled down so far there wasn't as many plates that needed to be spun, just wrap up the major plots and be done i say.","This is what makes the most sense. It wasn't that the story didn't make sense in the bigger picture, it's that everything had to rush to get there, specifically because D&D wanted to be done with it. We'd become so attuned to everything being a kind of slow burn that it gave us whiplash to see Jaime boinking Brienne one minute and headed back to Kings Landing so soon thereafter. That small detail was typically something that would have taken at least two episodes to get through.","Not OP, but to me, it wasn't about how it all got tied up or not tied up, traditionally or not; it, the anger, was about the pacing.

I think GRRM might have run into this himself. I wouldn't be shocked if this was somewhere in the ballpark of where he originally envisioned the end leading too, but now he's got this story that so sprawling and intricate he's struggling to pull the strings into place. I can't imagine how you would bring all these storylines to a single conclusion. As you pointed out it's something that any story with enough moving parts struggles with. Fantasy as a genre happens to struggle with this most. Personally, I don't want to dwell on the endings that fizzle but celebrate the endings that truly land.","Yeah, I truly do not understand the whole ""I cant watch the early seasons cause S7/S8 were bad"" mentality that is on this sub.","This was very well put, I couldn’t have agreed more","It diminishes entire storylines. There was 8 seasons of buildup for the night king only to do away with him in an instant and have nothing come of it really. They retconned a lot of what they were building up to and just crushed a lot of side stories. It's not just a bad ending that left you wondering. It closed every loose end horribly and made all those stories seem pointless in the buildup. Why care that jon is targaryen. Literally years of theories and hidden little secrets coming together for it to mean nothing. I cant go back and watch several episodes of samwell figuring all that out only for them to never use it again. They actively hurt the show by addressing everything they should've, just horribly so",‘The Door’....😢....it’s still too soon,Agreed the attack on the supply chain to me was some of the best television I have ever watched in 30 years,"With the Matrix and Star Trek: Voyager, I can watch the endings and appreciate them (I never watched lost). The end of Voyager is tons of fun. The ship is super powered, they kill a bunch of borg (I dont care how weak the Voyager borg were, a direct confrontation with a cube is dangerous shit), future Janeway dies sacrificing her life for a future she won't regret. Its powerful stuff. And the last fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith in the Matrix is great. I have no clue why Agent Smith exploded, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Neo's body turning to light, which I'm pretty sure had something to do with him going to machine city, which had something to do  with... point is, I can at least see why things happened the way they did, and thinking through them is kind of fun, even if I legitimately have no clue what happened. Theres stuff to enjoy in both these endings. 

What is there to enjoy in the ending of game of thrones? The visuals of Drogon burning down Kings Landing were the only good part, but I have no clue why Dany would do such a thing. I'm pretty sure it had something to do with Cersei, but wouldnt she just kill Cersei then? Why kill everybody but Cersei and have her come feet away from being just fine due to negligence? And then there's Grey Worm completely losing his mind, Arya's constant state of ""should have died but got lucky"". I have no clue why characters are behaving the way they do the entire time. And then there is the last episode proper. What the fuck even was that?",They lose so much when you know they are meaningless,"I feel the same way about the majority being great. But in regard to rewatching GoT or the prequels, etc, I'll never replay the main trilogy of ME because it ended so poorly. I feel the same about GoT. I'm not going to rewatch, I'm not going to watch the prequels (unless I hear near-universal praise after several episodes and maybe not even then).","Bioware also did a lot to soften the blow post-release. They acknowledged the issues, did what they could with an extended cut and the Leviathan DLC and then did a proper fanservice goodbye with Citadel.


I think that's a big part of why I can replay the series nowadays without feeling bitter.",And then he trolls them by starting the books over,I agree with ME. People expected them to make a game with vastly different endings tailor-made to their unique gaming experience which just isn't feasible even now. I really want them to make a sequel to ME:A. That game has a lot going for it and if they could give it a DLC to the quality of the ME3 DLC's i think they would win people over.,"Ok, so growing up as a geek in the 90s, on screen fantasy (with one or two exceptions) was either cheesy & childish or woefully underfunded. Practical effects, environments and costumes all looked like painted plastic. 
Lord of the Rings was really the game changer that opened up the purse-strings, but up until then it was me and a few nerdy friends who got it and from everyone else we’d get open mockery or gentle condescension.

GoT gave me convincing depictions of: undead hordes, giants, (of course) dragons. large medieval combats that felt cramped and desperate. 
I got to see a dragon destroy an army and I got to see organised infantry use tower shields and spears to surround and annihilate their enemies like my old Warhammer battles. 
I got to see heroes out of a dnd campaign lost in deep woods and frozen wastes, or staring out from battlements. 
I even got a necromancer on the back of an undead dragon fighting in the sky. 

Does any of this wash out the much discussed flaws? Probably not. But the stuff I loved to imagine as a kid was there on the screen and everyone got to see how cool it had always been.","Especially the song. My God. It gave me chills.

It was the best of the season but that's really not saying much. The dialogue kinda sucked","If there was like a full season and a half after it at least, yes. It loses luster since everything after it is a rushed comedy of errors. Pod’s song was beautiful.

This was my stance on Game of Thrones a few years ago. I attempted suicide. As I was recovering, I caught up on Game of Thrones, which I hadn't had the chance to watch for a while.

It became my only thread of hope. If I hadn't watched it at that time, or any other really good show, I legitimately wouldn't be here today. It kept me going. I couldn't end my life not knowing how it ends. It sounds stupid, but depressed people grasping at straws like that saves lives on a daily basis.

Luckily, I discovered The Expanse long before GOT ended, so I'm good for another couple years, at least.","Hey, I have hope for that one considering the author didn't just give up on trying to find a good ending like GRRM did.","I disagree with these people. I have plenty of enriching hobbies and a good job that makes me happy, but when I get into stories... My happiness and engagement are on a whole different level. 

I, too, am still devastated about the ending. I'm barely ready to even think about it. I even had a dream last night (I'm not making this up) about finally getting to finish the books to repair the damage the show has done to me.

As for right now, I am destracting myself with other series, as you are. Stephen King's Dark Tower is doing an amazing job, and I can't wait to finish the books and enjoy the journey (thankfully I was assured it stays amazing all the way through, although of course that's subjective).","Regarding Attack on Titan, I know that there's a *lot* of manga left, yet they already declared this next season coming up is the final season of the show. So, as a non-manga reader I have no idea if that means they'll shit the bed or not as they could try to shove too much in or end without some closure, but I'll be cautiously optimistic. Just a heads up so that you can already have gone to therapy beforehand :p","It's nothing like those. It's basically a behind the scenes of the final season talking to lots of different people involved in the show outside of the main people. It doesn't just focus on the the actors or the showrunners. Instead it mostly follows the likes of extras, David Nutters assistant, a dinner lady and others like that. It's a great watch.","Wow i've never thought of it that way. Maybe GRRM doesn't know what will happen next! He's written such a complex story that he doesn't know how to continue, not that he's a slow writer.","I mean, a fan was able to write her own plot of Season 8 and it's turned out to be pretty captivating.

Night King: First time?","Haha, it *was* a tad cringey, but I can suspend my disbelief pretty easely, especially with silly symbolism, so  I didn't mind it. Besides, like this user said, it was even more downhill from there, so I remember that scene without hating it like most of the rest of the season.",I hated the “I’m watching an anime trying to be meta” feel of it,"Right, this is a useless pretentious post about being deeply wounded. Get fucking real.","Are you not blowing it out of proportion? You’re literally claiming that you’re hurt because a show didn’t pan out the way you hoped. You’ve watched the show one time and haven’t read the books, most people have invested much more time than you in this story and that’s why they’re so vocal on its injustice.

I love the show for what it is. Season 8, when compared to earlier seasons, was bad. It’s a shame how rushed it was, but I still love and appreciate the overall journey even if some things are left unexplained. The books are hopefully where we get our proper conclusion, assuming they ever release. Either way, I still adore Game of Thrones and it’s unfortunate that some people act like the entire series is awful and completely ruined due to a couple of poor seasons and a rushed conclusion. It really isn’t. 

I don’t understand why people who are so disappointed with the show’s outcome still visit this subreddit and continually make posts. The series ended half a year ago.","Jon not being king would be A-OK if that journey was well done. Or if it happened at all. I expected a story and all that happened was ""I don wan tit"". I wanted his true heritage to mean something but that doesn't mean I automatically wanted him to be king. I *did* actually want Jon and Dany to be a couple and rule together as king and queen, or queen and consort if he really rejected the title, but I didn't expect to get that. I did expect a good story as to why, though.","Well. Don’t say that. At least you’re not hung up on some imaginary nonsense someone else made up, and being disappointed in their delivery of fiction.","I don’t know if it’s consensus, but I absolutely loathed the finale. Similar to GOT it felt like they didn’t have ideas on how to resolve the interesting stuff so they didn’t even try. Particularly disappointing because TNG and DS9 both have stellar endings.

Edit: oh but! It looks like the new Picard show is going to be a sequel to Voyager as well as TNG, so here’s hoping some of those characters get better send-offs as a result.","The end of VOY would've worked better if things had gone like we were thinking and they would move on to DS9 and VOY movies. Or even did a combined 24th century TNG, DS9 and VOY movie. 

It could've been longer but it really wasn't as bad as some of the worst series finales I've seen.",I like the ending of Voyager. I dont really get where the hate comes from.,"One of the things I’ve said to my friends is that GOT has made GRRM look less crazy for not having finished. As you say he’s got a million threads, and he’s clearly not willing to take the shortcuts the show took for the last few season. I respect it. I wish he could get it done, but I respect it. 

This actually makes me (downvotes incoming) sympathetic to Benioff and Weiss too. They started this journey assuming they would have a finale to adapt, and proved themselves REALLY GOOD at adapting for 4 seasons. I’m sure they weren’t wild about the show catching up to the books either.","I get why people think that. It’s frustrating when the whole turns out to be less than the sum of its parts. But personally I disagree. 

Individual great episodes of television, I think, can be enjoyed on their own. The writing, action, and direction in the moment are not affected by something that does or does not happen later. The action sequences in Hardhome, Blackwater, Watchers on the Wall, etc. are dope in a vacuum. Same goes for the big emotional moments like Tyrion’s trial, Cersei’s “they hurt little girls everywhere”, and Ned’s death. 

For me it’s about the journey. It would be nice if the destination lived up, but it doesn’t ruin the cool stuff we saw along the way if it doesn’t.",Ya well they kinda ripped that off from LOTR,Still better fan service than jaime fucking brienne and then dumping her..

It was frustrating. Those people *trusted* their Queen.,I feel like the dialogue generally sucked starting in season 5. Nearly all of the best lines in the show were verbatim from the books (Robert and Cersei’s conversation in my opinion being the best show-only dialogue as well as better than (or at least as good as) much of Martin’s dialogue). When that dried up the dialogue simply became a heavy handed plot deliverer.,"It felt like GoT: The Sitcom at times. It's like they had a quota of jokes for each character to tell. Most people on Reddit enjoyed the episode, but I honestly think it was just as bad as the rest of the season.","For me the last good moment was seeing the Dothraki wiped out. It gave me chills, but of course that was because I believed they all really died.","Fully agree, there were so many interesting theories around but at the end of ep.3 almost everyone important survived (except all of the Dothraki which later on suddenly respawned, *sigh*).

I almost forgot about Jenny‘s song... that was a beautiful way to end the episode (or the whole series for me).",Julio RR Montenegro,Is that GRRM’s non-union Mexican equivalent?,"Well fuck me, I'm starting to believe Martin planned this from the beginning :(","I second this. I eagerly took in everything GoT and ASOIAF for years. Watched the show through countless times and read the books twice. My and my wife’s house has art from the series and all that. Hell, my dog’s names are Podrick and Duncan (Ser Duncan the Tall.) We spent years speculating and enjoying that side. And for those years of entertainment, I thank everyone involved. It was a fun rollercoaster. Then the show ended the way it did. Not just the disappointment from that but the toxicity of the fan base afterward was draining and turned something I loved into something I started to avoid. Needless to say it was heartbreaking. 
This summer my wife told me about the people at her work reading The Stormlight Archive. I don’t really have much background in fantasy. I’ve always enjoyed the LotR movies but never read the books. Even Harry Potter passed me by until I met my now wife in 2011. Taking all of this into consideration, I was cautiously hopeful going in and man am I glad I did! The Way of Kings took me a bit to catch onto but once I did, I haven’t looked back. The books may be thick but they’re great and fly by.

All in all, I still think the show crossed the finish line if just barely. Seasons 7 and 8 still had some fantastic moments. S8E2 is fantastic and IMO a GoT all-timer.

And if he is going to miss the date, you’ll know way in advance because he consistently updates his progress (he is a much more methodical writer than GRRM so it’s easier to place progress percentages on his work). 

GRRM on the other hand will tell you a book is slated for 2020, then in mid 2020 say 2021, then early 2021 he’ll say if everything goes as planned it’ll be 2022, then a month later he’ll say he’s taking time to work on TV shows and press tours and is retired from writing.","Littlefinger was last seen *littlefingering* some Winterfell commoner but that never panned out, it could still be possible that LF is still alive, I guess.","Well well well, if it isn't the invisible cunt.",Its downright diabolical,"Attack on titan is so good!!

And just got more egregious over time until they're blatantly contradicting what happened in previous episodes.",Jim RR McMann,this is the way,"Man, I miss this show already!",What is the plot line of expanse? I’ve been looking for a new show. What about attack on titan? Have seen them but never heard much about either of them.,"AoT hits a lot of notes that attracted me to GoT. Great action, mystery, build up, etc. Give it a try, I can't recommend it enough. One of the episodes still holds the #1 rating for an episode on IMDB. If you give it a shot, definitely do not google anything about the show, even characters.","I thought season 3 of Attack On Titan was pretty good, especially part 2.","The issue here is that OP's happiness is tied to OP's perception of the created work that they enjoy as their hobby. It can still be a hobby whether you like the created work or not, but if you can't be happy watching something that you don't like, then it's a problem.","I think that’s really fair actually. Part of what made Breaking Bad’s ending such a success was that they collapsed what had been an expanding world down to a laser like focus on the relationships between Walt, Skyler, Hank, Marie and Jessie. That’s just five characters, all of whom we had been with since Season 1 Episode 1, and when they all finally came to blows it was just brutal. 

GOT had...a lot more than that. And obviously fans wanted satisfying endings for everyone.  And I actually was really interested in the choice to let so many people survive the long night, because it looked like we were going to see the pain of watching Sansa and Dany or Jamie and Brienne all have to now fight on different sides. But the structure of the show made that very difficult to execute in general, and impossible to execute in just 4 more episodes. 

As a result we never even see any of the people I just mentioned interact again once they leave winterfell. That’s honest to the structure, but it didn’t make for satisfying TV.","That’s fair, but GOT shit the bed","I don't agree. Expectations for the end were through the roof after Netflix punted the show into the pop culture stratosphere. 
I'm sure Doctor Strange can find plenty of timelines where Breaking Bad is looked at in a similar way to Game of Thrones (where the end shat the bed).","The McGuffin part didn’t bug me too much, but I will say the treatment of Gul Dukat and Kai Wynn is the most disappointing part of DS9s ending. Those were fabulous, nuanced villains that I loved and loved to hate, but they basically collapsed them down to mustache twirlers in the end. I would’ve liked to have been more conflicted about them, as I was with Damar in the end.","I always assumed they just started time jumping without telling us. But yes that's probably where it started to turn. I will say having seen and read some of the interviews B&W have given after the fact, I have no idea how they did any of this. It wouldn't shock me if in 10 years we found out there was some person behind the scenes that was able to focus them and they left for season 7 and 8. 

It reminds me a little of George Lucas and the prequels. Turns out he needed people like his ex-wife and Kasdan to even out his ideas with story structure. Maybe B&W had someone behind the scenes who actually cared about the intricacies GoT plot while they thought of the spectacle.","Omg I never put that together and now I'm so fucking mad about that. YOU'RE SO RIGHT! WTF! If she was going to ditch Sansa, she should have gone with Arya, not Bran. She swore to protect the daughters, right? Ugh.","This is how I read it too, no one else was going to write anything nice about him so she felt duty bound to tell his story.",Jōichirō LL Masukawa,this is the way,"The Expanse... without spoiling anything, it's set in the future after humans have colonized the solar system. Mars is an independent colony, with the intention of terraforming and making it fully habitable without domes. Earth and Mars are both pretty powerful and have a tense political relationship. There are also stations in the asteroid belt and on the moons of the outer planets, which range in function from mining and construction to scientific research and corporate interests. The population of these stations is the underclass of the system, called belters, and broadly speaking they are used and abused by the inner planets. They rely on Earth and Mars for water and air, and Earth and Mars use them for cheap labor.

In Season 1, some shit goes down that could start a war between Earth and Mars. The main characters' goals include preventing war, finding out what really happened and who was behind it, and getting justice for the victims. Trust me, the scope of the plot gets bigger with each season and the payoff is incredible. The books are awesome, the show does them justice, and it has some of the best scifi world building I've ever seen. Season 4 drops in two weeks and I literally paused my rewatch to type this up, so I am primed to talk it up:)

As for Attack on Titan, The show is epic and scary and filled with mysteries. I've only watched the first 2 seasons, but I remember after season 1 having TONS of theories and questions. Then I watched season 2 expecting answers, and it mostly gave me a lot more questions haha. I don't watch a ton of anime but that show is excellent and I'll probably catch up after I finish The Expanse.",Jiaozhi 22 Mading,Just finished S3. You have to watch it. It's incredible.

Seriously, his death served no purpose at all, there was never a ""what would have Barristan tought now?"" moment, no one cared about the fate of one of most famous warrior of Westeros at all and so forth.

Having him there would have had a whole new level to Dany's descent into madness: imagine if he was given to Drogon alongside Varys and his comment was ""now I know where your coin has landed""!","Oberyn, because I’m watching the Mandalorian now, but also because Oberyn was a cool character who didn’t deserve his horrible end.","The Hound.

I told myself there was no way they were killing every character with a redemption arc--Theon, Jaime, Melisandre, Sandor. Welp.

His ideal end, for me, is completing his Brotherhood without Banners arc by overcoming his fear of fire to wield a fiery sword and kill his brother. Maybe not out of vengeance but in order to save Arya, showing us he cares about someone and he's motivated by that now instead of hate. Then he swears off violence and becomes a foul-mouthed priest like Brother Ray.","Robb Stark, I was proper behind him as King in the North, genuinely at the time thought he was going all the way to Kings Landing, seemed to have the right mix of family name and leadership.

I hear this all the time... what exactly about this makes their death bad?... if anything, its a much more powerful death than ""dying for a purpose""... he was this acclaimed fighter, and he was taken down for nothing as you say... to me that makes his death so much more powerful and meaningful... because no matter how skilled and how noble you are, your life can be ended like a cockroach under a boot heel.","Hopefully he doesn’t meet the same fate in the books.

Once as King and once while worged into his wolf after his human death. I believe there was a line something like ""the wolf fought like a man"" (paraphrasing).","Because there was no point in him dying there and then. It could have been an unnamed unsullied and it would have been treated the same. Whilst what you say is true to some extent, the death of one of your closest advisor, let alone one of the foremost warrior in a universe where that would make you an extremely famous and important character should have some impact. In Barristan's case we have him die -> people look at his body in a scene and after that there's nothing.

No ""What Barristan would have said if he was here"", no ""I wonder how he would have reacted"" nor any moment of remembrance; the scene where they contemplate their inevitable deaths at Winterfell would have made for a good moment for Tyrion to tell his brother (you know, the man that served with Barristan in the Kingsguard for twenty plus years) ""You know what, the old man died"".

The point is not that he was not given a spectacular and meaningful death, the point is that his character was one of the most important (at least in Dany's ""court"") one day and the next it was as if he was never there to begin with. No consequences, no subsequent plots, not even a ""I want the man responsible for this brought to me"". Barristan Selmy's death was treated exactly like ""unknown soldier #36821"", we know he was there, we saw him dying but no one ever mentioned him ever again, which, again, is absolutely ridiculous given the huge importance he had in-universe.","The scene where they had his wolves head on his body as they paraded him, couldn’t watch.","Irrelevant, but I always found him the more handsome guy as well, despite the show constantly touting Jon as the ""Pretty One.""","Especially at the time of Robbs death, it actually puzzled me why as I guess I was still getting accustomed to the shows style and obviously we had no idea of Jon’s part to play.",Robb was like 13 when crowned king. Need I say more?,"At least she died the same way she lived,  hot as fuck.",Hodor!,Mormont,"Yes! Does that mean that when a Stark kid dies, like Rickon per say, would they warg into their wolf if its not dead? Just wondering.","> Because there was no point in him dying there and then. It could have been an unnamed unsullied and it would have been treated the same.

Incorrect, you would be nowhere near as upset if it had been an unnamed unsullied... your outrage at his wasted death is exactly the point of how he died... you are supposed to be upset that his death seems wasted... thats the point you are missing.",That was the first time a show made me cry... that was too brutal,HODOR?!?!?,There was another situation beyond the wall with Jon encountering a warg that proves the point as well.,"Yes death happens in sword fights, but I think the point this guy is making is his story of 'legendary knight who served under the targs is a targ loyalist' didn't go anywhere because the writers didnt know what to do with him.
They wanted to silence all reason for their shitty rushed ending, so they made Tyrion dumb and killed off Selmly.","Oh, so I'm supposed to feel a certain way now? My very point is that I don't because the way they treated him allowed me to forget abouth his very existance from one episode to the next.

I was not outraged at his death, I was outraged about how no one cared that he was gone and how no one even mentioned him after that.

The scene of his death has two characters walking down an alley, being ambushed and one of them dying. What would have changed if Grey Worm had been accompanied by a random unsullied, instead of Barristan? Once we've already established that his death did in no way caused me to be upset (I'm not upset at his death per sé, I am upset because of the consequences therein, or better the lack of consequences), what would have really changed?

Why was the man who served as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard for 16 years and then traversed half the world to serve Daenerys never ever mentioned again? That is what outrages me, particularly seeing as he would have been one of the few characters who could have made a parallel between Dany and her father as the story progressed.",Absolutely agree. The whole Red wedding event was just heartbreaking at points. Shows what a good series it was that it affected us and others that deeply though.,"I agree the 'making Tyrion' dumb side of the subplot was stupid, and only serves the purpose of making the story progress...

But i disagree about Selmy... yes, he was a great sword fighter, and he didnt exactly go out one on one did he.. he took out several of the Harpies before going down himself... they didnt nerf his character for this scene... they were gravely outnumbered and still managed to defeat all their assailants before Barristan finally died...","> Oh, so I'm supposed to feel a certain way now?

No, I'm saying that the fact that you feel so strongly about this is exactly why the death worked so well...

why are you so passionate about how Ser Barristan Selmy died?... why does it matter so much to you that his death didnt change the world?... seriously, ask yourself why his death needed to be so important...

If he had gotten the death you claim he should have had, Game of Thrones would have ended up being just another generic fantasy show... the fact that it throws conventions like that out the window is what made it so interesting to watch... and its loss of that kind of unpredictability is the very reason why so many people are displeased with the way the series finished.",Agreed!,"But the point was, his story didnt have to end there and then.
There were more than enough Dothraki and Unsullied to beat back the Harpies.
He was a useful adviser for a bit and that was that.","I am very sorry but I do not agree with you in the slightest. There is a huge difference between not doing what everybody expected and doing random stuff with no meaning at all.

Drogon could have gone rampage and killed Dany, that would certainly have ""subverted our expectations"" but it would not have made a good plot, just like Jon suddenly stabbing Sansa and Arya through the chest certainly would have subverted our expectations but again what plot would it have served? Throwing conventions out of the window is good as long as it allows you to make a good show / book and in that regard the death of Ned Stark, the man who seemed to be the main character, reached the objective for it had lasting ripples in the universe. In season 7 we're still feeling it when we have the ""father always said Winter was coming"", we were still reminded that Ned did exist as a character.

Barristan just drifted into oblivion and no one cared. Once again, I am not angry or upset or disappointed at the way he died, I am disappointed at the treatment he received after his death which was effectively a *damnatio memoriae* since no one even cared to remember he existed; that is what, IMO, makes no sense, not his death but rather the (lack of) consequences. And it did not subverted our expectations either, he was an old man and we had established a long time ago that everyone could die so it's not like it came exactly as a shock either.","the only reason it didnt come as a shock is because people were expecting a death to come...

Let me put it to you this way... do you think the story would have played out differently if Barristan Selmy had not shown up, saved Greyworm's life, and died in his place?... do you not think that would have changed the story?","[NO SPOILERS] means any comments with spoilers need to use spoiler tags to cover the information.

For me, S2 showcases the violence, political instability and general havoc which has historically almost *always* erupted in human civilisations whenever a king, emperor, etc is assassinated, and in particular when there's no coherent contingency arrangement in place to deal with the consequences of that. The deaths of Jon Arryn, Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon - arguably the three central players in Westerosi politics apart from Tywin Lannister following the death of Aerys Targaryan - plunge Westeros into political anarchy, fuelled hugely by Robert being succeeded by an 'heir' who is not only viciously cruel but also mind numbingly incompetent and completely lacking in logical thinking skills.

For me S2 was actually the most interesting season, for that reason. The deaths of just three individuals - individuals who only found themselves in positions of power because they themselves created a power vacuum by killing Aerys, and had to step up to fill it - led to continent-wide chaos. That kind of ""stability depending on and resting on the shoulders of alarmingly few people"" has always been a feature of human history and has always fascinated me.",Now we need a TLDR to the TLDR,"[NO SPOILERS] means any comments with spoilers need to use spoiler tags to cover the information.

He went back fought for the living because it was the honourable thing to do but it was never what he wanted, and when he found out who he really was, he didn't really care. He never wanted to be a ruler, he was raised as a bastard, watched the first love of his life be killed by one of his brothers of the watch,  betrayed by his brothers in the nights watch and watched as the second woman he loved burned innocent people and had to be the one to stop her from killing more. Why after all that would he still want to rule Westeros?

Jon would have found out he was Aegon and come back and claimed the Throne.,Well in the grand scheme of things it didn't really matter that Stannis burnt her at the stake since he lost the battle it was all for anyways. I guess... her death is the reason Davos convinced Jon to send Mel away from Winterfell but that really led nowhere either.,But he knew he was aegon and didn’t want it before or after 🤷🏻‍♂️,"""AYE DUHN WANNET""","I am not sure either Tyrion or Jaime are meant to be ""likeable"".  They are compelling and complex and absorbing but they are probably not intended to be people you instantly want to be friends with. Still, you could say the same about most of the Starks. 

Myrcella is likeable.  Tommen is likeable.  Granted, they are technically Baratheons, but still they are some of the few ""likeable"" characters in the show. 

Kevan is a man of duty and responsibility and portrayed reasonably favourably.  The show excludes the other more ""likeable"" Lannisters, like Aunt Genna and Daven, but cutting minor characters for TV was inevitable. 

Tyrion is, interestingly, made into the audience surrogate. That is probably because Peter Dinklage is such a popular actor and the show Tyrion is good in that role - an outsider on the inside.  So, yes, I would say the actor plays a big role in why show Tyrion is so popular, because he drove the direction the character went on the show and made him so relatable.

Otherwise though, most of the Lannisters are meant to be the antagonists and and portrayed as such. 

As for Jaime - the show really does go out of its way to darken Jaime when compared to the books, to the point of reversing some scenes.  He is probably so popular in the show at least partially because some fans read the books (bookJaime is incredible) and also because NCW is both a charismatic actor, and someone who knows about the book character and injects a lot of him into the show portrayal, despite the script.  Also, most people do believe in redemption, redemptive characters are often the breakouts, and his arc until the final episodes, although poorly done, was a compelling one.","Honestly i like all the Lannisters (even Tywin and Cersei)

But Jaime and Tyrion are the ones who definitely have a bigger heart.",Jaime*,"Nothing against Tommen and Myrcella. Tad boring but much better people than their brother, mom, and grandpa. And to be fair Tyrion's not just the most likeable one in his family. He's a strong contender for most likeable guy in all of Westeros.",Jamie was likable?,"Well if you’re liking a character only if they’re good then yea, but i liked tywin and cersi to certain extent coz how they are.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/gameofthrones) if you have any questions or concerns.*","Tyrion is likeable because he is an underdog. He is despised by almost everyone around him, even his own family, purely because of a condition in which he has no control over. Even when he succeeds, he gets almost no recognition whatsoever from the people around him. People love underdogs and find it easy to root for them, and Tyrion is nothing if not an underdog.

Another plus point for Tyrion is that he's both intelligent AND witty. There are many intelligent characters on the show such as Tywin, Littlefinger, Olenna, Margaery but Tyrion is by far the wittiest of them all. Being intelligent is one thing, but being intelligent and funny is a whole other thing entirely. Everyone loves a funny character, and Tyrion has a solid claim to being the wittiest character on the show. 

As for Jaime, I feel his appeal comes from the fact that he's often misunderstood by the people around him. He killed Aerys Targaeryan to save thousands of people, but the majority believe him to be a traitor and oathbreaker. He and Tyrion are similar in a sense that they both try to do good, but get no credit for it and are instead despised for their actions.",Technically they're Baratheons anyway.,How can you not like a guy who is willing to kill a little child to hide the fact he is fucking his sister?,"Most of the polls I've seen, here or elsewhere, have him as one of the most popular characters. He has a huge fandom on Tumblr, Ao3 etc. Certainly until 804 anyway. 

I'd also say he's one of the most divisive though.",Jaime*,He is likable in the books.,And protects his bastard children by fighting Ned Stark outside of a brothel.,"He definitely grew as a character.   He appeared pure evil in S1 and become more complex and interesting as he went on.

Tyrion is popular for the same reason.  He appeared an idiot and a drunkard in S1 and as things progressed you saw he was actually a lot smarter and capable of a lot more.  By the end of it he barely drank and there were no whores in sight.  Sadly he seemed to lose his brains somehow in S7/8 but most people understand that it was just bad writing by D&D

If you look at the other characters people like its that same growth and change that makes them interesting.  

If you look at Tywin for example he never changed, he was just a generic black hat villain from start to finish with no redeeming qualities. That makes him uninteresting and unlikable.",I wouldn't exactly call Tywin unlikeable. I think most people would agree that he was one of the best villains on the show.,"I don't see it.

Hearing how uncomfortable Emilia was with it, that she was pressured into the nude scenes by execs and had to drink to get through them, makes me wish the show was still around to boycott. Now it's over and done with, me posting this makes zero difference - what's done is done. But now I can't defend the show in any way. Probably this was old news for most people, but there you are.",You are what’s wrong with the world. Yuck 🤢 you are embarrassing,"Yeah but at the end of the series, scenes like that didn't even happen anymore so what would you even be boycotting?",Do you really have grounds to stand on when you are informed you will have nude scenes before signing up?,She was well paid and could have said no or refused the roll.   She has no reason to whine now.,"Extremely embarrassing, I'm sure, to dislike the fact that actors were exploited on one of my favourite shows. How reprehensible of me.","I get what you're saying, but there isn't a binary of having a nude scene that makes actors and actresses extremely uncomfortable, and not having a nude scene.

This from user /u/jaynelut in another thread about this article:

> I did a nude scene as an extra in my early 20s (22, so similar age to Emilia when she was shooting GoT). It was for a horror/ thriller where the protagonist sees a naked woman briefly in the back of a lorry that's driving erratically on the motorway and the story goes from there...

> I was the naked lady in the back of the lorry.

> On set, it was pretty good. I had my own portacabin. I was chaperoned throughout the shoot by a female member of the crew. The set was cleared of everyone except essential crew for the scene. I was constantly asked if I was okay/ did I want a break.

> I felt that my comfort was the first priority for the crew. Which was really great. I'd been hired through my extras agency because i'd previously done life modelling. The nudity and nature of the nudity was told me before accepting the job.

> That was in 2006. On a relatively budget indie film in the UK.

> I cannot fathom why HBO in 2010 would not have similar principles in place on a major budget production. It's pretty unacceptable really.

Versus this from the article:

> the nude scenes and the rape scenes were so brutal even the actors and actresses were uncomfortable with them—and producers intentionally made the show as pornographic as possible, even when actresses pushed back

...

> One episode director, Neil Marshall, noted that the producers were constantly pushing for more: “The weirdest part [of directing GOT] was when you have one of the exec producers leaning over your shoulder, going, ‘You can go full frontal, you know. This is television, you can do whatever you want! And do it! I urge you to do it!”

> “So I was like, ‘Okay, well, you’re the boss,” Marshall recalled. “This particular exec took me to one side and said, ‘Look, I represent the pervert side of the audience, okay? Everybody else is the serious drama side, [but] I represent the perv side of the audience, and I’m saying I want full frontal nudity in this scene.’ So you go ahead and do it.”

...

> In fact, she says, doing nude scenes was so awful that she drank vodka and cried to get through it, noting that, “Whatever I’m feeling is wrong, I’m gonna cry in the bathroom and then I’m gonna come back and we’re gonna do the scene and it’s gonna be completely fine.” The co-star who played her husband, Jason Momoa, also had a hard time with the scenes, especially considering Clarke’s obvious discomfort with it all. The first rape scene that ran on Game of Thrones, featured on the very first episode, was awful. “He was crying more than I was,” Clarke recalled.

> When she pushed back on doing nude scenes in later projects, however, the producers tried to strongarm her: “You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans.”

You can do nude scenes and not exploit your actors/actresses and push them to the point where they're breaking down and feel they need alcohol to deal with the scene.","A lot of actors or actresses who are being exploited may fear refusing to do something that they don't want to do in case it damages their career. Look at Harvey Weinstein's victims, or [indeed any victim of sexual assault in the workplace](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/21/women-sexual-harassment-work-careers-harvey-weinstein). People who speak out usually get harassed and their careers are made to suffer for it.

Emilia may have felt as a new actress that she had no option to go along with it.",Agreed. The nudity was in season 1 meaning she was aware before trying out  and signing for the job. I dobt feel bad for any of the cast that signed up for the gig. If they did there research they would know the books were all about nudity,She had an option - not to take the job.  It's really simple.  I understand she regrets her choice but she's not exactly handing back the millions it made her.,In the era of 'metoo' a lot of actresses who willingly agreed to do things onscreen or offscreen to get a benefit they wanted seem to want to play the victim to promote themselves,Exactly. People need to view this as an art form.

He'll definitely be hailed as a hero in the North, for sure.",I kind of feel like he'd get forgotten to most,He'll be loved in the North and I feel like most of the south will like that he killed the tyrant that laid seige to king's landing and burned so many,"He'll be remembered as a queenslayer and a kinslayer in the south. The North will remember him as the king who knelt, i think it's safe to say history won't look too kindly on Jonno boi :(","Varis did manage to send out several letters to the lords of Westeros about Jons true parents and they have the records to back it , also Jon was sent to the Wall which is part if the North and Sansa is Queen in the North which is its own seperate and much larger kindom then all the others and really wouldn't have to obey any of Brans commands.Jon dosent liket the South so hes not even really punished in any way","I disagree about him being forgotten. He  will be a legend, perhaps  one day he will even be more famous than Aegon the conquerer himself. He doesn’t have to sit on the Iron Throne to be famous, as a matter of fact I think Jon will be remembered just as much as Bran will be.


Yes he didn’t personally kill the  night king but he is the reason that the living even had a chance  (uniting armies and revealing the threat). I could even see children being told the legend that Jon himself was the first to put a sword in Aryas hand. Remember the night king does not even exists in the books, so Jon will likely get credit with defeating the death if the large plot beats are indeed, the same.

He also would be remembered by Sansa and the rest of the north as a great hero who fought the dead and killed the dragon queen only to be exiled to the lands beyond the wall with the wildings he helped save. 

In the south he will be remembered as more of an anti hero for killing Dany although I suspect the people of Kings Landing who survived will be happy, only disappointed he did not do so sooner. 

Some may even whisper that he was the son of Rhaegar the whole time. I find it very likely that the letters Varys sent were received by a few lords. Even if those lords never got it enough people knew the secret for rumors to spread around. I imagine Jon being the son of Rhaegar would become a popular almost cliche  Westerosi  conspiracy theory that gets whispered around courts and argued over in taverns (with some people arguing that Jon was attempting to seize the throne by killing Dany). This would all add to his legacy even more.

The set design is huge, the cinematography is incredible, the music is absolutely mind-blowing, and the acting is stronger than its ever been.

It’s unfortunate that we live in a world where everything has to be either perfect or it’s the worst thing of all time. The final season has some very high highs and some very low lows.

So season 5-7 were not great, but fine, but they *could* be good with some small editing here and there.

It can all be fixed by having the last season as a vision from Bran but then Bran sees the damage that is going to be done and realizes he has to alter the course of events,

I bet you're not even lmaoing.,Throw the bank at Peter Jackson and then I’m sure they would,"The point they were trying to make is that the biggest problems by far with seasons 7 and 8 are the pacing and lack of natural progression, which we see much better examples of earlier in the show. Simply cutting down what is available would do nothing to better the last quarter of the show, and therefore, the show as a whole for most..

That's what I gathered, at least",I agree. not sure why you're spelling it all out though lol. but thanks for telling me,"In all my life January and February  have been colder months, 

I don't  think the length of the day has a direct correlation to the temperature, as the atmosphere keeps in the heat.",That’s exactly what the winter solstice is...,uhhhhh... the winter/summer solstices and the spring/summer equinoxes are what mark the start of each of the seasons,"True, D&D did. I’m not saying Season 8 was good, cuz I agree it was terrible. Like there’s next to nothing I like about it. I’m not a defender of season 8, personally. 

BUT from a truly business standpoint, there is no way HBO would ever remake the last season. Sure doing it well could make fans happy. But that’s assuming they’d get the full budget after disappointing HBO in the first place, they’d get actors that have made it clear they don’t wanna come back to return, and that the next people actually do make a good season. And again, I think people really underrate how much HBO doing this would deteriorate the trust creators would have to potentially make future series with HBO at all. Very few people would want to work with a company that could throw out your work and redo the entire thing immediately after.  It might help the GoT brand a little, but it at the very least hurts HBO. 

I’m not saying we’ll never get another adaption. Clearly Hollywood loves remaking things. I’m sure maybe after all the books are finished or maybe in like 15-20 years we’ll get an entirely new adaption. Maybe live action, maybe animated, something like that. But I just personally do not see any world where HBO just says they’re remaking *only* the final season within a year of the show ending.",🤣🤣🤣,I'm lmao-ing pretty hard 🤣🤣🤣,"I guess I was refuting the part where you believed that everyone was pretending.

https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/season/
""In the Northern Hemisphere, winter generally begins on December 21 or 22. This is the winter solstice, the day of the year with the shortest period of daylight. Summer begins on June 20 or 21, the summer solstice, which has the most daylight of any day in the year. Spring and fall, or autumn, begin on equinoxes, days that have equal amounts of daylight and darkness. The vernal, or spring, equinox falls on March 20 or 21, and the autumnal equinox is on September 22 or 23.""

https://www.weather.gov/fsd/season:
""Near June 21st, the summer solstice, the Earth is tilted such that the Sun is positioned directly over the Tropic of Cancer at 23.5 degrees north latitude. ""

https://www.space.com/3974-summer-solstice-seasons-change.html
""In the Northern Hemisphere, summer will officially begin at the solstice, on Thursday, June 21 at 2:06 p.m. EDT (11:06 a.m. PDT).  The sun will reach the point where it’s furthest north of the celestial equator.""

I could keep going, but hopefully you get the idea....",👍🏻,Lolllll lmfao,The UK. It's the same in much of Europe.,"Interesting. This is not the tradition that I'm familiar with. I've heard a bunch of different traditions for when each season 'officially' begins, and most seem to agree that it varies geographically. That's what makes the most sense, as obviously say for instance southern Spain and northern Finland will have very different experiences and it seems a bit ridiculous to claim that it's not yet winter by the time the sun has disappeared completely in the arctic circle. But your articles certainly have *a* definition. Not that any of this actually matters, everyone has their own opinion on when each season starts and no matter if anyone claims to have the 'right' one it has no actual bearing on anyone's life.",">they most certainly signal the start of each season

That's not a universal convention. Many, many countries don't use the solstice as the start of winter:

> In the UK, meteorologists consider winter to be the three coldest months of December, January and February. In Scandinavia, winter in one tradition begins on 14 October and ends on the last day of February. In Russia, calendar winter was traditionally reckoned from Christmas (25 December in the Julian calendar, or 7 January in the Gregorian) until the Annunciation (25 March in Julian). In Celtic nations such as Ireland and in Scandinavia, the winter solstice is traditionally considered as midwinter, with the winter season beginning 1 November, on All Hallows, or Samhain. Many mainland European countries tend to recognize Martinmas or St. Martin's Day (11 November), as the first calendar day of winter. The day falls at the midpoint between the old Julian equinox and solstice dates.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter)",Are you really trying to consider tradition over scientific fact?,"No haha I'm trying to say that there's no such thing as a hard fact in this case. For some purposes your definition works, for others other definitions are more useful. Winter isn't the same length everywhere.","None of that is ""scientific fact"". What a dumb way to talk about something like seasons.","[NO SPOILERS] means any comments with spoilers need to use spoiler tags to cover the information. Show tags are black. Book tags are red.

- Season(s) 1 to 4.  People can rank them as they like, but they are all so spectacular in their own right the marginal difference is small. Technically 1, 4, 3, 2... but again, they are all amazing.
- Season 6.  Just a phenomenal 2nd half to this season and the last two episodes in particular.  The first half though was pretty meh
- Season 5.  This is where the show problems begin to stand out, but despite that still I think it tends to be  pretty underrated.... especially considering the seasons in the near future.  Sansa lacks any reasonable motivation for going to WF, and the Dorne story line is bad.... that said Hardholme is great and the walk of atonement is just... wow.  Definetely doesn't come close to matching season 1-4 though, and doesn't have the payoff season 6 does.
- Season 7/8.  The opposite of seasons 1-4.  Both these seasons are just horrendous, and completely undermine the show, its themes and its characters.  Season 8 was laughable, but it was also the culmination of garbage season 7 started.  That said, season 7 has the worst story line in the entire show (WF story line... seriously, *everything*... EVERYTHING... about this story line is so egregious), and season 8 has the only 5 minutes of worthwhile character development and story telling over the last 2 seasons, which is the knighting of Brienne.

I think they were on record as being largely against flashbacks, but perhaps adding this one series of them could've saved a lot of the other choices they made.","While I can appreciate how this would help develop her character, it really means nothing if the show doesn't take time to explain it.  And the show didn't take the time to explain the character development they did offer.

As it stands she has a perfectly adequate internal conflict... her perceived entitlement to rule (has the blood, the power and the love of the people) vs her intent to be a 'great' ruler.  These two ideas collide many times over the show. Leaving us with a character who is caring and patient for those who bend the knee, aggressive and violent towards those that don't. So when she arrives in Westeros and finds out that:

- the people aren't waiting for her to come save them, and in fact show little interest in (if not at times disrespect or fight against) her becoming Queen.
- she doesn't have the claim to the throne she believed she did.  Another has a stronger claim
- she starts losing her source of power, along with those she trusts and loves, but isn't 'rewarded' or respected more by those she coming to 'save', despite the sacrifice

It makes sense (in theory) that she would snap.  KL does surrender... but not until they've been given no choice.  So she punishes everyone in the city.

But, like all things season 7/8, there is no time spent developing this. No time showing Dany's internal conflict play out in her choices.  No time showing Dany struggle, in private, over what choices to make.  No time showing Dany take (small) steps towards her eventual fall.

Trying to explain her desire to just return home vs her struggle to take the throne is much more complex than what D&D did do... and they failed at the easier job.  I don't think adding Dany's desire to return to an easier life would change much of anything.  If anything, just make things more confusing.","They made a huge mistake but it wasn't not having flashbacks it was in wasting Missandei.

They didn't need flashbacks to show different aspects of her character. THEY JUST NEEDED TO SHOW DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF HER CHARACTER.

In the book what characters are doing and what's going on in their head often don't match up and we can see that easily because of internal monologues. In the show we don't have that but we can get the same experience by seeing how a character acts differently around different people. This difference should be most stark when seeing the difference between how a character acts in public and how they act with people they trust, with whom they can let their guard down. We can see this (at least in the good seasons) with Jon opening up to Sam, Tyrion opening up to Jaime, etc. etc. etc.

They could've done the same thing with Danny but instead they criminally wasted Missandei. All of the stuff you want to cover in flashbacks could've been easily covered with conversations with Missandei. Danny could still be Shouty Dragon Lady in public but then have her pour our her heart with Missandei about the red door, how she's terrified half the time but is faking it until she makes it, ""look behind and I'm lost,"" etc. etc. Have her on the brink of tears with Missandei and then someone comes in and without missing a beat she goes back to Shouty Dragon Lady.

Instead we get the idiotic romantic subplot with Grey Worm and barely any scenes with Danny opening up to someone she trusts so it's all Shouty Dragon Lady all the time. So much that Danny becomes really flat as in the show she is nothing but Shouty Dragon Lady.","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

They tried so hard to make her the hard Shouty Dragon Queen that they disregarded any of her nuance. She went from scared girl about to marry Drogo to super powerful and confident Dragon Queen in 1 season.  

It also burns me how they portrayed Drogo. In the books their first sexual encounter was very romantic and tender. He holds her and tenderly caresses her while she takes the bells out of his hair and brushes it under the stars. He woos her. Yes the books state that his people mount their women like a stallion does a mare, but it also goes to great lengths to show that Drogo and Dany's first experience wasn't like that at all. In the series he basically rapes her like some common whore while she cries. He's portrayed as some savage when the books don't do that at all. They love one another and you don't get that impression through the series until he's dead. Drogo was a great character so this burns me.","what an amazing scene that would be

It's not like they could go back and prevent Robert from becoming King or marrying Cersei. The Lannisters weren't going to admit the truth of Joffrey's birth and would have wanted him to be King, Stannis & Ned would have felt Stannis was the rightful King and the war would have still happened - the root cause was Cersei & Jaime having children together and by the start of the series that can't be fixed. Renly may still have tried to take the throne for himself, etc...

Unlike Robb, I don't think Ned would have named himself King and tried to become independent of the Iron Throne - I think when war broke out the North would have supported Stannis because Ned was pretty upfront that Stannis was Robert's rightful heir.

Keeping Bran on the ground so he didn't get paralyzed, maybe marrying Robb to the daughter of a Northern Lord which would prevent him from making a disastrous marriage choice, etc... are things that could have been changed to hopefully have better endings.",Go find the direwolves and their dead mama.

He’s defensive of her, but I think there’s a change when her first reaction to his identity is to think about the throne. It’s kind of a revealing moment, even though I also understand why she does it. When you make your life about one thing and then that thing becomes endangered, it would be very upsetting. What I can’t explain is Jon’s lukewarm reaction to her when she takes him dragon riding and tells him they could live there for ages. In the books that’s exactly the kind of fate he wants to share with Ygritte. I don’t get, at that point, what that’s about since Sam hasn’t told him yet and Dany hasn’t started acting questionable.","From the discussions between Tyrion and Varys, it's heavily implied that Jon wouldn't be able to get past their kinship. I'm not sure I even noticed much of a reaction from him to her ""you'd have a claim to the Iron Throne"" line as they were all wound up for the impending battle. In the books (I know they are different, but I feel it does add a dimension to her personality) her inner dialogue goes over how she wouldn't be alone once she's queen, like Aegon wasn't - this is after she thinks about her loneliness. While I'm pretty sure now GRRM would also go the ""Mad Dany"" route, I can't imagine that her hearing she still has family, a son of Rhaeger, would drive her to just whinge about the Iron Throne. (Although I get that even so, the show can't capture *all* of the nuances in the POV chapters). 

While it's pretty iffy on its face, Jon had already slept with Dany. I can't help but think that maybe he could have thought it over and come to the conclusion that as a Targaryen, it's 'not all bad' lol. But his reaction was understandable.","Lets just wait for the book, I gues that would explain it properly","Tbh he's just got to winterfell in preparation for the fight for humanity. A happily ever after is probably something he doesn't want to get too excited about just yet, especially when all the northern ally's are pissed at having to work with a southerner.","Yeah exactly I don’t think Jon’s a big fan of the throne obsession and her increasing “madness”. 
In a perfect scenario I think Jon would want to marry Dany and she rules, with Jon advising her. He probably wants Sansa ruling the north. In this scenario no one would find out his true identity (except for Sansa and Arya). Sadly, Dany had to bbq Kings Landing which led to her inevitable death.","Yeah Jon would’ve got over it after the initial shock. We’re looking at it from a 21st century Perspective . Even Ned’s parents were cousins. These kind of relationships weren’t that uncommon. Jon even says “we can live together” heavily implying they would’ve been together. Jon has done crazier things for love aka loving a wilding girl Yigritte.

I think Jon’s because conflict was that he is not who he thought he was for his entire life. Not being Ned’s son must have devastated him. 

Daenerys’ reaction was all about the throne and I doubt Jon is too into a mad woman obsessed with power. 

The discussion between Varys and Tyrion did mention the incest thing but I doubt that was the biggest issue. It has very little importance in Westeros. 

The main reason Jon was turned off was not because of incest but because he cannot stand by a woman driven by a lust for power who won’t stop at anything to get it. Jon even had a “wtf are you serious” reaction when Dany started talking about the throne. Jon fell in love with Dany because they shared the same ideals, wanting what’s best for the people. That wasn’t who Dany was anymore so Jon distanced himself from her, I  don’t the fact that she’s his aunt played an important factor except the initial shock.",There’s a chance it might play out entirely differently from all the negative fan reactions but yeah I agree!,One of the curiosity i have about him is why he never sought to the be any type of warrior. IMO easiest way to get men to fight in my man is if I’m a legendary(at least competent) warrior and in the field leading them.,Sounds like you're describing Caligula. We all know how that turned out.,"He got what he wanted, a gold crown.  I just finished the first book and he was worse in the books.  He was never capable of ruling.","This interpretation would work if he were portrayed as having any sympathetic qualities whatsoever, rather than being a totally unrelenting shitstain whose psychopathic cruelty is even implied to be hereditary. Even Joffrey is portrayed more sympathetically in the TV adaptation, where his tyranny is implied to be partially the result of his environment and not just purely being an uncommonly vile human being.","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

Season 7 episode 1.  Almost *EVERYTHING* about the show changes right from the start of this season.  Some people, some how, lump this in with season 5 and or 6.. and I don't get it.  Its notably different.  It is, without any question in my mind, the equivalent of the often despised season 8.  

Now everyone has their own opinion, so watch as you like.  That said, if asking for advice, and if I'm offering mine, the show starts running so fast you really don't need to even watch it after season 6.  Just turn to a plot synopsis as it will offer just as much explanation and development as the show does.  That is no lie.  That is no exaggeration.  The show sprints through its final 13 episodes just jumping from point to point. 

Then, after reading the synopsis, if it appeals to you, you can turn back to the show for its special effects, music and the other notable things GoT does.

He can get into the cave because Bran was in the cave when the NK gave him that mark, i presume.

You just inferred everything out of nowhere even though none of it is said on screen. Bran the builder is of the north just like the children of the forest (who we've seen have the magic power to establish barriers that the undead cannot pass through), I kinda assumed he used the magic of the north when building the wall.

Besides, it’s cosplay and if people want to get all up your grill about your Khal being a woman and pale skinned, just tell them it worked for Danerys, and they should get bent!","I think in terms of cosplaying it doesn’t matter your race or gender when choosing who or what to cosplay. It’s for everyone and doesn’t need to be exactly like the character, that’s the fun of it, putting your own twist on it.

First of all, if she thinks GoT is porn then she hasn't seen porn.

Second, it's art. It's part of what makes the story raw and realistic. Just like a book, movie, a play, a piece of music, etc. 

Third, Muslim scholars of long time ago helped preserve a lot of Greek philosophy and history and those of other civilizations and cultures by translating their books, some of which most definitely included sexual content.

Finally, there are far worse things that make a bad Muslim (or human) than watching GoT--stealing, killing, hurting others, being unjust, etc. 

Tell her to breathe.","Also, there’s nothing wrong with sex, I feel like Islam & Christianity demonize it way more as a form of control,  especially the men.",What? Like I have a pretty prude personality and GoT does not brother me much. This is just rude accusation without any real evidance. I dislike these kinds of people.,"Don’t let her judgemental attitude get to you. It sounds like she has made up her mind, found some articles which ‘prove’ her beliefs, and isn’t even interested in listening to your point of view. Bottom line - you can not reason with someone like that.    
I love the books. For me, some of the key themes Martin examines in his writing are the horror and cost of war, the corrupting nature of the pursuit of power, the effects of trauma and loss, the agony of impossible choices, issues of identity and belonging, the power of compassion. Yes, these are not new themes, but they strike at the very heart of what it means to be human, to grapple with the choices we make, and to face the consequences of these choices.    
When it comes to the cultural phenomenon that is GoT... I look around and I see hard-core fantasy nerds suddenly discussing everything from philosophy to literary analysis. People who would *never* have participated in a book-club pre-GoT have embraced a new lexicon and are having a rigorous discussion about fantasy tropes, character arcs, the Heroine’s vs the Hero’s journey. I see scholarly books being published by university presses that discuss everything from psychology to military strategy through the lens of GoT. People who’ve haven’t picked up a fiction book in decades rediscovering the joy of reading after watching the series.  Suddenly topics like the War of the Roses, the Battles of Cannae and of Agincourt are entering water-cooler discussions.    
Sure, there’s negatives - internet trolls, cheap efforts at cashing-in on the popularity of ASOIAF/GoT, those who see the violence not as an indictment of the worst within us but as cheap entertainment (and worse still, obtain a dark enjoyment from it).  The TV series definitely threw in nudity and sex amidst the violence.  But it’s one’s own responsibility how one deals with that - critique it as commercial interests and/or exploitation? view the violence as a damning commentary on our darker impulses? derive sick pleasure from it? Whatever choices one makes, surely it’s better to go in open-minded enough to consider why one reacts the way one does, and prepared to have a rational discussion about the issues. Is this challenging? Yes, it can be. Is it pornography? Not in my opinion. At least, not unless specific segments are isolated and stripped of both context and authorial intent.     
GoT can be enjoyed at one level as a great story, or can involve an exploration of the content matter at a much deeper level. But pornography? No.",Sorry this sounds like a group of my friends when I was young & still in the Christian world. It seemed to only get worse in that world which is why I stay far away from practicing religions. You can love & serve your Lord without succumbing to sanctimonious crap like this.

Crows are also a bit scummier birds in general, carrion feeders and such.","I think it’s derogatory but at the same time, they embrace it. They call the ones who collect new members around the seven kingdoms “Wandering Crows” so I’m not sure if that was a nickname given to them by outsiders and enemies, or they gave themselves that name because of their black tattered clothing.

Funnily enough though, my Dad told me that Three-Eyed Raven is called the Three-Eyed Crow in the books. I think they changed it for the show to help viewers distinguish them from each other.

Here’s what the wiki says. 
“It is also implied that he was once a man of the Night's Watch, due to his tattered black cloak - which means that the ""three-eyed crow"" name is a double-meaning that was lost when the TV series chose to consistently refer to him as the ""Three-Eyed Raven"".”","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

They also said it was something out of their field that they hadn’t done before. I think they meant star field but I always took it as them making somebody else’s story there for got. That’s well off for them. George r r Martin wanted for it to be them though. there actually was a role playing game in 2012 that was awful and cheaply done. I think he majorly settled when Bethesda went for Skyrim instead.

One of the best characters. 

And in the books one of the more enigmatic, because she never had a chapter with her name (we never had the chance to enter inside her mind and see what she is thinking, just like Little Finger).

>she cared about the poor","She was for a second. I was loving her story and so pumped to see where she was gonna go. I was pissed when that shit happened. She was so dynamic. A great character and pretty good morally but she moved like a snake. She was fascinating. Between her and her grandmother that was some great story. I thought her death was bullshit. but it did add to olennas further story and end in a big contributing way. She would’ve been a good queen I think. She was certainly built for it... what Sansa grew into reminded me of her. Except she was weighed down cause she was so entangled in so much, with Cersei’s tentacles all over her. I wanted to see where her strength was going to take her further. Her and Oberyn’s deaths were a let down for me. NOTHING compared to the entirety of the dreaded 8th seasons giant pile of rubbish tho.",Her only flaw was to underestimate just how far Cersei would go. But yea you’re absolutely right.,Nah she was too hot. Wars would be fought tryna get it,"You forgot she was so sexy the French king called her his English stallion because of how often he rode her.   

Maybe I'm mixing them up.",I loved her character. She was great at the game. I always felt like her interaction with the poor was just as calculated as everything else.  She probably gives two shits about the poor but understands that she'll have an easier time gaining rule if the commons support her.,I can get behind that 😉,She was Queen three times,SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK,But a priest told her not to leave the room.   It was a great end for her arc.,Im just hoping GRRM completes the books before dying.,And that is exactly why Cersei wanted her gone lol,She was Westeros's first three-time Queen! That is fairly significant.,That wouldn't *subvert expectations* enough,Yeah but... she dead,A little power hungry I think but still one of the best choices,"See I think she was playing everyone but Olenna. Most of the ‘good’ she does can be seen as political manuvering: getting the support of the people while undermining Cersei’s standing, spiriting away Sansa to Highgarden, etc. none of her actions are truly altruistic.

She wanted to be THE queen more than anything else. I believe she was just as ruthless and cunning as Cersei but was just better at hiding it. She drops her mask a few times throughout the series and it’s rather frightening.","Yep but the combination of fuck ups D&D and Cercei being the waste of human skin that she is had to go and fuck it all up.

Blow up 3 people and now the Reach belongs to the Tarlys. Kill THEM off and I guess we can give to Bronn and/or the Unsullied now?","Thank you for sharing that about her character in the books. That’s very interesting. I feel like they worked with her character like that in the show. I felt like it was too hard to truly read into her intentions or more so reasoning for her actions. She worked in such a morally gray space. I think the only thing to shine from under it clearly, was her love for her family. Aside from that I feel nobody can truly say what she was morally, or why she did everything she did in a deeper sense. You just couldn’t read into how far calculations went. I always believe she cared for people and not just the throne. I think her lust for power was a testament to that actually. She did it all for her house and cared deeply for her family at the least. 

I appreciated that she at least had that moment for her character in the end. being the one who figured out what was going on and trying to save the people there. mostly herself I guess, but still she tried. That sucked to watch her final moment of realizing her inevitable death. It did feel rushed for her story and a waste. She really was a fascinating character.","I could have accepted a ""rushed"" death for her and the high sparrow. But anyone who would have cared besides Olenna (and we all know how DnD handled that) blew up with her. Cersei suffered no consequences in a show that supposedly had actual consequences.

Yep, that seems to be how things work in Westeros at the end of the story in D&D's mind.  When Davos initially said that line to Grey Worm I didn't even catch that he was talking about him ruling the Reach because the idea is so monumentally idiotic and implausible, I thought he was just offering him land to settle.  But after Bronn got the Reach and rewatching that scene, particularly where he talks about how ""the people who lived there are gone,"" it seems that he was literally offering that.  

The politics in the later seasons of the show were extremely dumb and even by TV standards highly unrealistic.  The Reach is the most populous and powerful kingdom in the realm, but somehow the Tyrell family dying out is enough for them to end up with Bronn (or the Unsullied) as their liege after having no vote on the new king (Sam doesn't count, he was Night's Watch and then a maester, as an heir he had been rejected by Randyll, and even he if he was Lord of Horn Hill nobody in the Reach would have viewed him as a legitimate representative just because Randyll pulled a Roose Bolton).",Do you think GRRM wouldn't have done something similar?,Don’t you mean she was the queen of Westeros until the queen mother of Westeros blew up the queen of Westeros,"That's not what was said, though",This ^,"I was specifically referring to meta-logic real-world reasons for it, not in-narrative ones.","She had no issue starving those same poor people when her family was fighting for the other side.

Robert subsequently managed to get all of the Seven Kingdoms under his thumb, and founded a dynasty, he was largely considered a legitimate King due to the totality of his victory.

That being said, in feudal societies like Westeros is one, succession generally happens via (male) primogeniture. It might be that ambitious members of the dynasty like Renly try to overthrow those superior in the line of succession, but that doesn't really change primogeniture. Let's say Renly had children with Margaery, then he would have wanted his children to succeed him via primogeniture, no matter how he himself obtained the throne. An occasional disruption doesn't change the general rule. And it should also be mentioned that Robert enabled Renly's coup somewhat by granting him Storm's End, thereby artificially weakening Stannis. He made Stannis so weak that overthrowing him became a real option for Renly.

Last but not least, Renly's attempted coup was by no means democratic. Renly was a vassal of the Iron Throne who has accumulated too much power, and had collected many feudal allies like the Tyrells. His ""I am the best suited"" talk is not real meritocracy, the translation is ""Through my scheming I have collected enough allies that I can now make a move on the throne.""... The peasants had no say in who becomes king, which would be real democracy and meritocracy. If Renly had won, he would have distributed the spoils of war among himself and the Tyrells, and among Baratheon and Tyrell vassals. Other nobles would have been on the losing side of the conflict, and would have lost influence.","Only because you mention plot armor....

&#x200B;

There is plot armor that makes sense and is logical, and then plot armor that is a literal ""well, X can't die because, well, we don't have a show otherwise."" and Jon has both. When Jon gets betrayed by the Night's Watch and comes back, it makes sense lore wise. He is the hero, sure, but they set up the Lord of Light bringing people back from the dead, and Jon up until this point was the leader in the coming war.

&#x200B;

Then.....there's the Frozen Lake. I've written about it before, but Jon, the Hound, Ser Jorah and the rest died on that frozen rock. They had no food, no water, no shelter, no (cooking) fire, nothing. They froze to death most likely before the Raven was even sent to Dragonstone. But, even if the raven was sent with the message, there are two major issues. One: Gendry had no clue about the lake so he couldn't have known where to tell Danny to look.

Two: The more important one and the fact that seals Jon and Co's death. The distance between Eastwatch and Dragonstone. I've seen a few dozen different claims on the distance but one thing stands out. Dragonstone is anywhere from 1200 to 1900 miles away.  At minimum, that is the distance between New York City and Miami. Even if Gendry made it back to the wall, even if they got the raven airborne with the message, there is no fucking way a Raven can make a 1200-1900 mile journey in under 72 hours. Jon and Co. died Beyond the Wall.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But no, a 2400-4000 round trip journey happened in under 72 hours (more like under 16, based on what we see in the show) and somehow Danny homed in on Jons GPS tracker. DnD gave Jon hyper plot armor...and spat in ever viewers face while they were at it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Edit to add: A simple enough way to solve this issue? Because if I'm going to complain about this scene, I will voice how I would have fixed it just enough to allow the suspension of disbelief. And it's a real simple change/addition. Horses. If each man had a horse, they could have been used as a source of food, Gendry could have made it back to the Wall faster. The 2400-4000 mile flight would still be there, but at least Jon and Co. would have food. Berric could use his sword to light a fire (not sure where they'd get the wood, but hey DnD already spat in our face) so they could cook said horse meat.*

Even Hotpie knew Cersei blew up the Sept.  It doesn't exactly take a genius to figure it out either.

>Olenna is openly committing treason by aligning with a foreign invader.  And Randyll has betrayed no one because there are no Tyrells left to obey. Only a widowed, openly treasonous Redwyne.

It isn't treason because Cersei has no basis to claim the throne.  Especially not if you're viewing Olenna's rule over Highgarden as illegitimate.  She didn't even have the voluntary fealty of any other high lords.  Furthermore, the general idea here, which basically boils down to ""it's not betraying the Tyrells to side with Cersei because Cersei already killed all the Tyrells"" is a galaxy brain take.  I've seen you post in GOT-related subs enough to know you're smarter than this.  I feel like you're trying to defend the general course of where the books are going, where Dany will be seen and rejected as a foreign invader, but the books are going about that in a drastically different manner.  The show has to stand on its own, and the way it portrayed things was nonsensical.  

The show treated Olenna as the legitimate ruler of the House after her family's deaths, and even when Jaime tries to convince Randyll he doesn't argue that she's illegitimate in doing so.  Also, there is precedent in the books for a childless widow to continue ruling a house - Barbrey Dustin is a Ryswell by birth and had no children with her husband, but has been the ruler of House Dustin since he died in the Rebellion.  Donella Hornwood also continues ruling after her husband and son die, and various men (including Ramsay) scheme to acquire her lands through marriage.  If we're being realistic, even with Willas and Garlan cut out of the show, the claim would pass to one of Mace's relatives, who would presumably take the exact same stance Olenna did.  Also, if you view Olenna as treasonous then you must view Robb the same, but does that do anything to help Roose Bolton's perception in the North?

>But given what we know about Lord Leyton, it seems it would take a bigger issue than this to drive him to war.

LMAO, Cersei only blew up the center of the Faith and killed his son-in-law and grandchildren, no big deal, right?  While Leyton himself has been reclusive, he did send his soldiers to join the Tyrell army in support of Renly (which was way more transparently treason than what Olenna did, because Renly's claim was clearly inferior to Stannis's, as well as Joffrey's if you didn't accept the rumors of his parentage, and which Renly didn't really care about either way.  On the other hand, Daenerys had a reasonable claim to the throne whereas Cersei had none and had just committed a great atrocity that also a direct attack on the Reach).","In a show where a little girl can swap a face and turn into a full grown man, this is your grievance?","You know what, I'm going to revise my comment.

This is my bad, it’s been VERY long since I watched Season 7 and I’ve been knee-deep in writing my alternate ending. I had forgotten that they made it such an “open secret” that Cersei destroyed the Sept. So yes, your points on that accord are very valid. The Hightowers absolutely should have taken up arms against Cersei. 

The problem with arguing show logic is that we’re dealing with material that makes no sense. Cersei has no claim to the throne, but within the conceit of the show, we’re told that the lords all apparently accept her authority as the rightful ruler. We are also told that the only Tyrell family members are the ones in the show. 

I’m not trying to argue the show’s plot makes sense. My main point is that House Tarly is the logical next choice to be made Lord Paramount in the chance deposition of the Tyrells.

He would still have died. Cersei had backup plans in case he returned, and has already tried to kill him before. Remember when Robert insisted on taking part in the Tourney of the Hand? In the books, Cersei challenged his manliness, hoping that he would get himself killed. 

> Without him dead, the war of the five kings wouldn't happen, no dragon queen in the east would be coming,

First off, the War of the Five Kings would have happened even if Robert died naturally, the manner of his death wasn't the cause of the war. Also, Ned would still have found out about Cersei and Jaime, and Catelyn would still have captured the Imp in the Riverlands, triggering Tywin's reaction.

Not likely. Let's say Robert returned from the hunt and survived Cersei's backup plans, then chances are that an assassination attempt on Ned would also have been carried out.

Plotters don’t just lay down one plan, it’s a spider web of constantly fluctuating plans, actions and outcomes.   Observe orient decide act. OODA loop.",I don't think that's true. There were a lot of people already plotting Roberts death and they would've succeeded somehow. Especially the Lannisters. And then Ned would've died anyway since he figured out the truth about cersie and Jaime. Do you think cersie would let Ned live after that ? I agree story wouldn't be as dramatic but there would be one nonetheless.,">The only real threat that I can tell would be the dead in the North.

Surely without Ned dying, Arya would never learn to fight. And Sansa wouldn't get involved with LF. So they wouldn't have had the dagger to kill the NK, or the training to wield it. So wouldn't everyone have died?",How can Jon welcome Dany to Court when the premise is that Ned did not veto killing her. She is dead in this Situation. So no Dragons either.,Why would stannis still kill renly ? I dont think renly is stupid enough to fight for the throne when he knows that stannis and melisandre could kill him too if he raises against them.,Like after actually seeing what melisandre could do and watching Robert die that way I don't think he would take that risk.,"Ned fought Robert about the assassins, but even after Robert relented it was too late to stop them (Vary's was explicit about this) and Dany lived anyways. Her life was saved because Mormont outed the wine seller that was sent to poison her, not because of Ned's recalcitrance.",Isn't that exactly what happened?,Uhmm I was saying this in reference to the alternate story the guy made. He said that stannis kills Robert with the help of melisandre's  shadow son so if renly had seen that stannis carries the power of magic I don't think he would take such rash decision. In reality renly thought he would beat stannis in war and wasn't prepared for the backstabbing,"Well, that assumes that everyone would know how he killed Robert, which seems unlikely. I don't see how it would be different.",Well we could fight about alternate endings all day lol.

Euron claims to have been there but Rodrik's really suspicious of his claims and it's not really clear whether he was telling the truth or not.",That sound even better! thanks,Thank you!,"Two of GRRM's main strengths are dialogue and characterization. Even though Euron's barely in the books, the few chapters he does show up are fascinating. Enjoy your read!",":) Be warned that it features and mentions characters you won't know if you're show only  - Aeron, Victarion, Asha (sort of Yara) - and some events that transpired in FEAST.  But it definitely gives you a feel for BookEuron and what he is capable of and I am sure it mentions Valyria and what he may have learned.  It is a good but super disturbing read!","Yes, I would, because when it comes to storytelling, *Thrones* is pretty unparalleled. It's not often we get storytellers like GRRM who are able to surprise us while setting those surprises up in advance beneath our noses, not just throwing them in there for shock's sake. It's not often we get such a sprawling cast of talented actors, and get to see their paths intersect. It's not often that characters have so much depth that we find ourselves rooting for bad guys, or questioning whether our support of good guys is warranted. We especially don't get to see storytellers in fantasy exercise such self-restraint when it comes to magic, so that when the fantasy does happen it doesn't feel cheap or gimmicky or like it's in there because the author was too lazy to come up with a better solution to a conflict.

I was hugely disappointed by the last two seasons, and almost all of this could be attributed to pacing. But I also knew this would be an issue before the seasons ever came out when they announced the number of episodes and that the story would end. There is no way they could've done it right in the space that they had. I refuse to drag the incredible work of the cast, the cinematographers, the effects folks, the costuming folks, the location scouts, the stunt people, his masterful highness Ramin Djawadi, etc over one decision that blew everything to hell and back. And I would also encourage people to develop the ability to sit down and enjoy the experience of watching an episode before they dissect it. At some point you can choose to cling onto your anger and hatred and disappointment, or you can lean into what about the series you loved. I think most people I'd recommend this to are capable of not letting their worlds fall about because a couple seasons of a show were subpar.","Absolutely. Even with the rushed final season, it's still an excellent show.","I'd say just know it peaks at season 4 then slowly but surely accelerates down hill from there. 

Some great battles in the later seasons, but know there is no satisfying ending to this story, and that a lot of the paths you'll go down may prove meaningless.

If u can keep expectations low, still worth a watch","I’d warn of an awful ending(entire final season) but explain it’s well worth it for the ride that gets you there. The stories told before the ending stand taller and are the heart of the show and what it’s about. There has been nothing else like it and it has and will serve as inspiration in film not(only) for its take on the genre, but story telling and nuance beyond genre. It’s one of the bigger(est) things in film of this generation. 

It’s hard for me to say that cause I utterly hate the ending(if you can’t tell..) and it hurt how I feel about the thing, but credit is due to that show. It’s well worth the watch. I’d recommend it.",The first seasons suck. But that final one is worth the wait.,"Yes, just watch seven seasons and then make up your own ending.","[NO SPOILERS] means any comments with spoilers need to use spoiler tags to cover the information.

Check out this thread. It's the Singaporean forums for all SG things. 

Secretlab contacted the OP directly to appease the mob but all the rest of the peeling issues remain unresolved. 

Mine included. Hasn't even been a little more than a year and the leather on the front has all peeled away.",Most people agree that gaming chairs are just gimmicks. Some are nice but you're better off just getting an office chair.,"No.

A good office chair will not use foam. It will be adjustable to match your body build. They will be supportive and comfortable for many years after the foam in a cheaper chair would be crushed.

The temperature comfort can also not be understated. Sitting it a giant foam chair is like being encased in insulation. Sometimes its nice, but more often it's not. Nobody likes swampass or swampback. 

The down side is that they *start* at ~double-triple the price of foam chairs, but they're designed to last basically forever.  And if something does go wrong, you can order replacement parts because it's all adjustable individual parts and not giant chunks of foam sewn inside faux leather. 

So for home use, it's an investment, and not one many people are willing to make. But I now shudder to think how much I wasted buying $200 mediocrity from an office supply store every couple years after materials wore down and the seat or base got wobbly.",Wow that’s horrible. I stand corrected. However it looks like they’re replacing them for free for these defective units.,"Ah, thanks",So which chair do you recommend? I was looking at a comfy one from office Depot but wondered about the longevity,"Haha glad I could shed some light on this low quality scam. I contacted them a few weeks ago for the same leather peeling issue and they brushed me off as ""wear and tear"" and offered an insulting 70USD to return the chair, even though I purchased it for 400USD.","I have the me7erg. 

When I was looking at getting a good chair seven years ago, that was the popular budget alternative to the Herman Miller aeron series. (Which is another to look at.) 

I can't ""recommend"" it in the sense that I have no idea what the ""chair market"" looks like *today* so I'm wildly uninformed in terms of buying advice.

But, they still sell it, as well as parts for it, which says something. I wouldn't recommend *not* getting it. I love mine. I had to tighten one bolt once. Across seven years and a move. That's the extent of its ""wear and tear"" while averaging 6+ hours of use a day easily. If I wiped down the arm rests I could probably pass it off as new.

I have no comparable experience with any other similar chairs so take this with a grain of salt. 

edit: I bought it after a cross country move, so that's why I know the exact age of my office chair. Which would normally be really weird.","[NO SPOILERS] means any comments with spoilers need to use spoiler tags to cover the information. Show tags are black. Book tags are red. Game tags are orange.

She was the only one reborn among salt and smoke when her dragons hatched.,"If it's anyone it's Dany. She fits the prophecy best, she literally woke dragons for stone, her and her dragons saved the world during the long night. The thing that really convinced me of this however was the theory that AA isn't actually supposed to be this amazing hero, more like someone who ends up saving the world but still is a questionable person which kind of fits Dany to a T in season 8. She saves the world but then she goes and destroys part of it. This also seems like something GRRM would do because we know that he hates writing cliche heroes and villains so it would be very much like him to make the last hero Azor Ahai be someone who ends up committing mass murder after saving the world.

They dropped the whole prophecy thing halfway through the eighth season.,The friends we made along the way!,No one. D&D just kinda forgot...,"Jon Snow is Azor Ahai... Arya is Lightbringer

The Legend of Lightbringer mentions three attempts to forge the mighty sword:

* First attempt, breaks when being tempered - this could be a reference to Arya's life falling apart just as she was learning sword dancing from Syrio.
* Second attempt, drives the sword into a lions heart - sounds to me like a reference to Arya and her time spent in Lannister territory, even serving as cup bearer to Tywin Lannister himself
* Third and final attempt, drives the sword into the heart of his lover - this would of course refer to the tension between Dany and the Starks, and her ultimate undoing in the end.

The most crucial piece of evidence for this theory is the fact that Azor Ahai was supposed to wield Lightbringer against the darkness... and it was Arya herself that ended up killing the Knight King.","[NO SPOILERS] means any comments with spoilers need to use spoiler tags to cover the information.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/gameofthrones) if you have any questions or concerns.*",Like everything 2d forgot another part of the story,"I think the entire point is to teach not to rely on prophecy. They are tricky beasts, after all. And that no matter what is written in our history books, there is always an issue with folklore, superstition, unreliable narrators, and embellishment.",Dumb and dumber are shit writers who don’t care about overarching plots. If these are the same people that said “themes are for 8th grade book reports” why would they adhere to a prophecy. All they want to do is sUBveRt ExPECtAtIons,There was no Azor Ahai. We are what we make of ourselves with the utilities we have (which I personally find much more interesting than prophecy and fated-to-be).,"I guess Jon, even though he didn’t directly kill the NK, he was the reason the NK died. It was him who died and came back to life to unite everyone against them. 

He also killed Dany and saved countless cities from being toppled as well. This is just speculation but if I had to guess I would say Jon Snow.","I will try to answer with my theory. Unlike many people who think that in idiot 7 and 8 season we saw the final of George but the path will be very different in the books. I think it is the opposite. The path will be the same (or very close). Almost everything we saw will happen. But the final and the meaning of everything will be completely different. In fact I think that the main problem with the serial was that DnD has never understood anything of the story or the heroes. 

Examples: I think the ASOIAF is a story about the 7 kingdoms. But in the serial is a story about Stark, Lannister and Daenerys. Daenerys is indeed the most important character of the story but that doesn't mean you have to ruin every other story which is what DnD made. And I don't think they have ever even understood what Daenerys really means and symbolizes. For them she is just blonde girl with dragons who want to save the world (or to sit in the Iron throne. It doesn't matter). Which is why there were so many changes and in every change TV Daenerys was much dumber then in the books.

Jon in the books WANTS the throne, wants recognition, wants to prove how worthy he is. He will bend the knee to Daenerys again but not because he doesn't want to rule. He wants but ... 

There are two possibilities. 1. Jon is an idiot and that explains why his BIGGEST choice was so ... wrong. Why he didn't see ... what was that... the ""signs"" of ""madness"". Why Varys was worried about Daenerys and Jon told him ""She is my quenn"" instead of the opposite. Jon be the first one who see how ""evil bitch, hypocrite, power hungry, tyrannical, selfish, throne obsessed"" was Daenerys and Varys to be the one with ""She is my queen"". 

The other opportunity is that Jon wants the throne. But he is the white wolf. He is the man. He knows nothing but what is right. He understands what has to do. He knows his duty. And that is why he chooses Daenerys. Because she is the right choice. Not just before the battle with the dead people. She is the right choice 24 hours and 365 days in the year. But he is the white wolf which means he is the only one capable of understanding the true. Not Sansa, not Varys, no one else. In Westeros - the land of schemers - that is the reality. He is son of Rhaegar Targaryen but he is more child of lord Stark, then Rob, Sansa, Arya, Rickon... And lord Stark died because he was the only one in his time surrounded by an idiots... By the way Lord Stark was screwed by Sansa who revealed a secret she was supposed not to. Does that ring the bell? Or the fate of Lady?

Anyway you have 2 logical options: Jon is the man and his CHOICE about Daenerys is just ... right. Or he is a moron and Daenerys is not the answer. 

There is no third option like Jon is the rightful king. He is the man and his biggest decision is a ... well stupidity but in his defense Daenerys has tits. That is idiotic.

And here starts the biggest thing. The NK - was destroyed... in the battle of Winterfell. I think Martin will do the same in the ADOS. In the serial that means ... nothing. The dead were just plot devise to lessen the numbers of Daenerys's army. Incredibly stupid meaningless waste of time.

In ADOS it will mean ... everything. It will mean that the dead have never been the biggest threat. Azor Ahai will not be found here. Because this is not the real enemy. But why? 

1. The army of the dead symbolizes the nature. The volcanoes, the hurricanes and so on. So the biggest threat is obviously something with VERY HUMAN nature.

2. The NK was so strong magical creature. The most difficult one to kill. It is much easier to kill Drogon then the NK. But on the other hand you have the gods behind you. And if you kill him no matter how difficult it is - you win. There is no more army of the dead. And the gods have a thousands of years to prepare. That is why Arya killed the NK. A no one. There is nothing special in the NK. But what if you have a problem which can't be solved by just killing ... lord Tywin for example. LIKE THE GAME OF THRONES. In the beginning we had king Joffrey. He was a dick and we hated him. So he died. Well... did Westeros became a better place to live? No. It was the same shit. Because Joffrey was the product of the system not the opposite. 

In the beginning of the books we saw 3 people beyond the wall. One of them was young knight of house Royce which is from the Vale. It seems that almost every name in Martin's world has a meaning. So why Royce. Why not Hornwood for example. Well, these three people met the army of the dead. Two of them were killed including the knight. The third one was beheaded by lord Stark later. After that we saw the direwolves and lord Stark has returned to Winterfell. And he heard the news: Robert was going north and ...

yes, Jon Arin, not some meaningless knight but the MOST POWERFUL person from the Vale was also dead. Actually killed by the game of thrones. Winter is coming is not referring to the dead. It is a reference to the GOT. In the 4th book Jaime enters the riverlands because of the siege of Riverrun. In his thoughts he was thinking that from everything he had seen 

1. There is no village that was spared from devastation
2. There is no one maiden who wasn't raped
3. There is no unburnt field

or something like this. He advised the first people he met to sow and to pray for reaping. Shortly after that was snowing... May be this was the place we had (I include myself too. I didn't see what was coming until S8E3) to ask ourselves ""OK, we expect the army of the dead. But almost 100 % sure they will be defeated. Then what they can do to the riverlands. They are already ... absolutely destroyed""","This is from the book, “Light Bringer” could potentially be “Dawn” the great sword of House Dayne. Dawn was made out of a ore from a fallen meteorite. Or a fallen star. Light Bringer was said to be wielded by Azor Ahai. Dawn was last wielded by Ser Arthur Dayne, but after his death, it is still waiting for the next “Sword of the Morning”. They could be the Azor Ahai promised? This based on the books not the show.","It was Jon, Dany was his Nissa Nissa and i think the identity of his Lightbringer is very open to interpretation. Maybe it's metaphorical and Lightbringer was the peace he forged via killing Dany? Or maybe the showrunners just forgot about this bit and there's no Lightbringer in the show, who knows?","It was Jon, it's just that the great evil he was destined to stop wasn't the Night King, it was Dany,",I think it was when JON kill Dany because they butchered her ARC so bad. Jon killed her to save her from furthering butchering.,...no one...,Prince that was promised was mentioned a lot,That’s lame,"She didn’t die though when she was “reborn”. Plus if she was, what was her lightbringer? Dragon was useless against the Nightking?",I think she was the stallion that mounts the world in addition. They saw her and not her son.,"I hope you stretched, good sir",I'll help you get whatever you need off the top shelf next time bud.,Seems like you’re all saying jobs arc was pointless,"Continue.   

The NK is a metaphor for the GOT. If he touches you - you are lost for the living and will become a WW. If the Game touches you - you are lost and you become a PLAYER. The army of the dead represents all victims and dead people because of the PLAYERS. The actions of the WW seems absolutely senseless. We think that the actions of the Players are highly motivated so they are not senseless. But what if no matter if you rely on family (Stark), or army (Lannister), or fleet (Greyjoy), or woman charm (Tyrel), or the law (Stanis), or game safe (Doran Martel), or revenge (the Snakes), or the manipulations (Baelish), or the deceit (red wedding), or the gods (Melissandre), or the poor people (The High Sparrow) , or the torment (Ramsey), or the chosen from you (Varys) you are absolutely 100 % destined to loose at the end. Because nothing of this actually works. Then your actions will be as pointless as the actions of the army of the death. 

I think that in TWOW:

Doran will die which will lead of a civil war in Dorne and Dorne will be completely ruined. By the dornishmen.

The ironborns lead by Euron will be repelled from the Reach but the Reach will be totally destroyed. So thousands dead ironborns ... for nothing and the Reach doomed ... for nothing.

The Stormlands (where is FAegon now) will be somehow ... destroyed completely and FAegon will die. 

The Vale. Lord Baelish has to finally reveal his plans but the only result from them will be his failure and the Vale will be severally devastated because of his countless shenanigans. 

Cersei will be somehow unexpected victor in the south, probably with Euron as his only ally. But more and more western soldiers will be dead and the enemies will not be completely defeated so the struggle continues.

The North is already fucked but... OK, the destruction will continue and will end with Jon as King in the North. By the way, the destruction of the North will be mostly because of the ... northmen! Not because of the ""filthy"" South.

Here we see what Martin means with ""the serial needed more seasons"". More seasons to destroy Westeros. Not for the ""signs"".

Last chapter. The whole Westeros is absolutely destroyed and in ruins. And it seems that the end of this stupidity is not even close. There is no a single place that was spared. But Westeros is still full of players. After all, they never learn. Everywhere schemers including the North. At this moment. Finally. The Rightful heir on the iron throne arrive at Westeros. Daenerys. 

It is time for A Dream for spring. May be Daenerys will win the Game? After all she is:

The most beautiful woman in the world (Tyrel), The Unburnt (Mellisandre), The Mother of dragons (Stark), The rightful heir on the Iron throne (Stannis), a cheater (ask the good master of Astapor or the Khals), The chosen queen (Missandei and the unsullied chose her just like the wildlings and the black brothers choose their leader), The Conqueror (Tywin), The Breaker of chains (The high sparrow), The queen of Meereen (Doran Martel), The inquisitor (Ramsey), The Stormborn (probably Greyjoy. Remeber the Storm god), The Khaleesi of all the dothraki in the great grass sea (Baelish) and the chosen from Varys. May be she will succeed to win the Game? ... Or... May be ...

I hope now you understand who is Azor Ahai, who is Nissa-Nissa, What is the Long night. What is the lightbringer.

But that is just my theory.",lol what a cop out,Lame,"A) Prince that was Promised was mentioned a few times, but never really reached a conclusion re: who it really was, and B)Azor Ahai was not necessarily the same person.",Unfortunately I think we're gonna have to wait for Georgw to answer that one as the TV show just did what it wanted in the end.,"The way I see it, Azor Ahai is a legend. So no one was going to end up as Azor Ahai. The prophecy was about the prince that was promised.

Also, I don't think there was **a** prince that was promised in the show (and I don't think we'll have one in the books neither.). I think the Lord of Light had a plan that needed many persons (Arya, Jon, Beric, Daenerys, etc). I don't feel like this is the type of story to have one big hero. (Show and books)

And if there's one recurring theme in this story, it's that prophecies are complicated and hard to read. More often than not, following prophecies led to mistakes. I think that leaving this a bit unclear is really fitting to this universe.","I don't think you can know she didn't die and come back in the flames. We saw her walk in and we saw her alive many hours later. She could have died and been resurrected, we don't know what happened in the flames.",Cop outs are what we got with game of thrones season 8,Or...you can take my first reply as Arya...like I intended...,GRRM said himself most if not all prophesies are BS...,I think at the very least there are rules to the prophecies. Like you only get brief poetic visions.,So you like lazy writing huh?,And the fact we know she’s immune to fire? Even if the show runners turn around and say “oh yeah she died in that fire” that’s not clear and incredibly lazy writing,Still lame,The show later decided she was immune to fire. The books don't seem to suggest that she is.,...not as lame as your lame ass question...,"Her immunity to heat/fire is hinted at in episode one when she gets into a bath that her handmaids warn is way too hot. The writing gets pretty sloppy later in the series, and the last two seasons are truly awful, but the first three seasons are extremely well written.","The books have her get into a super hot bath but it’s no big deal. Some people can tolerate hotter temperatures, I mean I can. Meanwhile, GRRM outright said that dany surviving the flames in the book is because of the magic allowing her to survive. 

Even then, Dany lost all her hair.",She walks out of a bonfire and you think the show decides later?,...good one...,"Dany's high tolerance to heat comes from the books, but it isn't the same as being immune to fire.","It seems from your post as if you've read the book. So I'm sure you know about George's opinion on whether Targaryens are generally fireproof (they're not). And about his statement that ""The birth of Dany’s dragons was unique, magical, wonderous, a miracle."" And when asked if she could do it again he said ""probably not"". 

The book seems to be suggesting that there is more at play than just being ""immune to fire"". The show chose to make her immune to fire on multiple occassions. So yes, I think the show decided later to make her fireproof. Instead of looking into the possibility of blood magic, spells, curses or anything like that, they picked the easy option of ""she's fireproof"".",Seems to me that had more to do with bloodmagic than being immune to fire,Ok. I haven't read the books so I assumed it was foreshadowing the funeral pyre scene. Thanks for the clarification.,You are correct I have read the books and know that even George wouldn’t abandon azor,"Whether or not George would abandon Azor Ahai is utterly irrelevant. The books aren't written, so D&D couldn't use the full story properly. They were given the bones of the story, they built the rest. They made it very clear that they had to condense the story. They didn't mention Azor Ahai in the show, so why would they then reveal who he is (if he is ever someone new, rather than just a hero from the past)?",You sound like a DnD apologist so never mind,you’re crazy talented!,Are you a professional artist?

She wishes she could be the mother of dragons without having to do a nude scene but she knows it's one of the requirements for the role and she still knowing that, trekked on.  It was always *her* choice.  She could of dropped it at any point.  Also notice how she now vocally complains about it once the show is finally over.",[removed],"Nah, don't be so defensive.

Don't get me wrong, the industry is full of slime and nepotism. Weinstein was something everyone knew about him but she is trying to have her cake and eat it. She took the fame and money and now the show is over this comes across as trying to milk the woke crowd.

No one is owed anything in the acting industry, nudity, gay. If you don't want to do it say so. No one should shame you but no one owes you",Literally,"They’re not very contradictory statements though. In the beginning she was pressured to appear nude and she had no leverage at the time to say no. As the show went on, she gained the ability to say, “no, I will not do this unless I feel it advances the story in some way.” She isn’t about doing nudity for gratuitous sake which a lot of season one was. The episode in season 6 she obviously felt the nudity was well placed and an empowering moment rather than, oh she’s naked again.","What are you supposed to believe? That she’s always said she was uncomfortable but can now be totally transparent about it now that the show is over, she is no longer beholden to them and she is likely more aware of the growing movement that has her back,",In the article it says it wasn't in the contract. Do can imagine how an actor getting their first role in a major production would have a hard time turning that down.,Sounds like you assume because you want to dismiss her complaint. You shouldn't be enjoying boobs if the person you're looking at is extremely uncomfortable.,Of course she wouldn’t turn down the role she loved Daenerys and had no other choice then to do so,Yeah and turn down a role that would launch her career besides you don’t read an entire seasons script before being cast.

Last Christmas flopped (60% drop and Frozen will kill it)and it looks like nothing else is on the horizon.  The timing of this is too perfect. I dismiss her because fame and popularity while on GOT was more important than her morals. If she brought it up during its 8 year run, I would praise her and support her. Now, not so much.",Yes she knew the cost of playing as the character and she loved the character so much she obliged to it and the cost it comes with.  That's exactly what I said.,"Yes, that's whiney.   She took the trade off knowingly.  She has no reason to complain now.","So not only do you give a non argument, you attempt to dismiss what I say on the assumption that I am a demographic you think you can safely dismiss and insult. 

If you assume different demographics think differently then it's stupid of you to assume I don't understand. By your own admittance you can't relate to others if they are different.",I don’t assume. I bothered reading the article.,Or maybe cuz she was still in a contract with them and saying something then would affect her her role/salary not everything is so  crystal clear as you think buddy,We don’t know what the contract says so we can’t say much,"I don’t owe your *opinion* and unwarranted generalizations (and let’s be clear that’s what that is) and argument, dude.

I’m not saying you can’t relate. I’m saying you choose not to because your needs are met and you give no shits about people like Emilia’s. If anything, your comment was entirely dismissive of what she’s talking about do you deserve to have your own comment dismissed. The end.",What's the worst case scenario?  I imagine if the contract had a nude clause and she signed it then she basically understood the requirements and said yes.  If the contract had no nude clause then she can say no and terminate the deal because there was no contractual breach on her part.,"You won't find anywhere in my post where it says I can't relate unlike you who pathetically attempted to dismiss my argument based on what I am. Not what I've said.

It was her choice and because I relate I struggle to give a shit when given the circumstances, its hard not to see her as entitled. You have actors like Steve Buscemi and Danny Devito who play characters who are insulted and belittled based on the appearance of the actual actors themselves. No articles for them who frankly get the short of the stick, hired to be mocked. But again that is their choice but given your lack of empathy I doubt you've even thought about things like that.

So when Arya ended the threat of the WW in the show, I wondered if LS had a role in that in the books. I started to think that maybe because she was dead, she would be able to get close to them. (But I don't believe the threat is ended by a single stab in the books.) Perhaps she will give herself to them as their new Night's Queen and sacrifice herself to save her kids. I don't know, but I feel like having been dead will be more relevant in the books than it was in the show.","I wondered this some time ago, particularly given Cat's desire to literally strangle Cersei.  The words are remarkably similar to the prophecy, and LSH may not even need to make KL if there is some massacre at a Red Wedding 2 (although that may not be a satisfying end for Cersei, it would mirror Cat's death).  But someone pointed out to me that the words are: ""And when your tears have drowned you, the valonqar shall wrap *his* hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you.*""* From what I understand, the ""valonqar"" can be interpreted to mean little sister, but the ""he"" is more problematic.  

But I do think LSH makes a certain thematic sense for the reasons you set out.  It would also explain why GRRM was so annoyed by her exclusion.  That said, there was reason enough to be annoyed anyway - the omission of LSH from the show resulted in the loss of Jaime, Brienne and Gendry's arcs, the possible changing of Arya's to make her actiongirl and the number one killer of Freys, and the downplaying of the 'broken man/devastation of war' message that played through many of those Riverlands chapters in the books.","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

But two books seems honestly like a lot better room to work than D&D arbitrarily telling themselves after the season six finale that they had thirteen episodes left to end it all. I’ll never understand why they thought that was a good idea.,I think it has to do with the fact got go so famous and because he now has no time. And also the books often number in 1000+ pages.,"But it may not be a literal prerequisite, due to gender ambiguities in several Valyrian pronouns.  In any case, most theories allow for females, especially Arya who when little passed for male.  As it turns out, show  Dany came as close to being the Valonqar as anyone because she caused the Red Keep to crumble (just like Cersei caused the Sept to crumble!). 

I do think /u/sleuthwood may be right about Catelyn/LSH.  That quote is eerily reminiscent of the Valonqar prophecy.  But I don't see her leaving the Riverlands or Cersei going there.  I still think Jaime or Arya will be the book Valonqar.  Show Arya was given a lot of LSH (sigh), and she IS Cat's Paw.  Also, Beric sacrificed his life for both of them.  Beric found LSH's body thanks to Arya/Nymeria...so she's a pretty good candidate.","Perhaps the ""he"" is R'hllor. He is what is keeping LS alive, after all.","George's said he felt very pressured by the show but i don't think he's the kind of guy to worry a lot about how certain bits of his plot will be received by the fandom or whatever, of course the books are FAR more expansive than the show and that means they take a lot longer to write in general.","The word ""he"" is a specific pronoun and not subject to any Valyrian clumsiness.

It also isn't some kind of mistranslation by Maggie considering she is the source of the prophecy rather than an interpreter of it.

He actively wants revenge on every last soul in Westeros for what happened to him and he does things like rape people and set off wars solely because he can. Show Tyrion... is not that person at all. In general, Book Dany's advisors are either terrible people, nonexistent in terms of advice, or are literal children.)

They got so focused on hitting that ending point that they didn't bother to think about whether or not they should hit that ending. The end result is a storyline that either makes no sense whatsoever, fucking implies that eugenics is a great idea (If she went crazy solely due to her DNA then the lesson is that crazy people were genetically predisposed to go crazy and there is nothing we can do to help them. Good moral for this day and age that definitely has not been disproven /s), implies that literally every last soul who saw Dany in Episode 4 and 5 prior to this somehow doesn't know how to handle grieving people, or that being too woke and caring about stuff will make you do bad things (Dany went crazy and lost her shit because she got too focused on saving everyone. The people who win in the end are the ones who don't want it.) It's just... how fucking big of blinders do you need to not see how godawful this ending for Dany's storyline in the show is?

I especially feel bad for Emilia.

Nothing exactly satisfying about it in any way in my eyes,"Ah, I see you enjoy garbage!","I haven’t read the books, so.

But my two cents:

Dany’s finish made sense. In the end, she only wanted what she thought was best; a fantasy world which didn’t know how to get. 

In the beginning, she was full of hope and wonder. She was quickly matured by her marriage to Khal Drogo, and this taught her master skills in manipulation; in the TV series, he raped her, yet she turned around, convinced him and his village she loved him, and became a hero in their eyes (and perhaps she did love him; but becoming their hero went against Dothraki culture.... yet she did it.). And when she hatched her dragons, over time that feeling of love and tenderness turned to power and ego. She saw herself as all powerful, mainly due to her dragons; and when her dragons die, we can see that she doesn’t love them as much as she once did, for she continues on with Drogon without much but a thought.
Finally, she gets addicted to the power. She turns from Breaker of Chains to a tyrant. She becomes addicted to people bending their knees for her; swearing their allegiance. This leads her to turn to quicker ways of reaching her goal for the “perfect world”; by a reign of terror, using her dragons to frighten people into “swearing” their allegiance. In her eyes, she is only furthering her goal, by whatever means necessary, making her a perfect Queen. Of course, we also see the flipside to this by seeing the terrible aftermath of the war, which is meant to leave viewers with a conflicted feeling on Daenerys and leaders in general (and the author of the books was very vocal about his objections to Vietnam, as well, so this only makes sense.) In the end, Daenerys falls victim by seeing only the long-term (her fantasy world) and not the short-term (war and destruction), becomes power-hungry for her world, and falls short to listen to those lesser than her. This is almost, in a sense, a tribute to many modern day leaders and past wars.",I agree. Dany going crazy seems like it’d make more sense. In the books the targayeans go crazy because of their holier than thou black and white mindset. Dany always has the potential be crazy and I liked the half of the episode where she goes crazy and destroys everything but it just didn’t feel right. It suffered from lack of buildup. It went from natural progression to a fucking train wreck.,"Havent read your whole post, but just from reading the first few sentences it seems you have a lot of misunderstandings of dany's story.

>In the beginning, she was full of hope and wonder.

Strange way of saying she was young


>She was quickly matured by her marriage to Khal Drogo, and this taught her master skills in manipulation; in the TV series, he raped her, yet she turned around, convinced him and his village she loved him, and became a hero in their eyes

So much wrong here. The only ""manipulation"" she learnt was how to ""please"" the khal, sexually, of course. Idk if that really counts as learning how to manipulate, and not just learning how to be a dothraki wife.

She didnt ""convince"" him and the village she loved him, she actually did in a messed up stolkholm syndrome way. And it wasnt her manipulation that got her people to look at her as a hero, it was the fact she birthed dragons (accidentaly, dont forget)",Or... or how about this? It was terrible fucking writing?,"Yeah, her going crazy in the books would work reasonably well in the books with what has been set up. I personally think its a perfectly fine ending for her in the books and in general most of the characters' end points are perfectly fine for what has been presented (Sansa's not as hideously traumatized and emotionally dead inside so her being queen makes more sense, Jon's thoughts on being in the North are much fleshed out, Tyrion being made Hand of the King as punishment and getting his achievements removed from history makes sense with his darker and intelligent character, and even Jaime ultimately dying with Cersei and being in love with her still is fine because we still have a bunch of room for Jaime to regress back on that.) They just genuinely rushed it too hard and didn't really look at the characters they had written new stuff for and how that might change things (Dany's increased focus on saving people and her advisors generally giving her decent moral advice makes it far harder to make her go evil believably and Sansa's increased trauma and colder nature make it harder for her storyline to not be a depressing showcase of men writing women. To clarify on the latter, gee guys, maybe it's kinda fucked up that your winning female characters are all stoic badasses who don't care about anything other than themselves or their DUTY. Maybe, just maybe you should consider not making them all just like that.)","Obviously I *know* her story. I am just providing examples.

When you compare the quality of Season 1 to Season 8 you’ll notice there was quite a drop. 

For instance, in Season 1 there was more dialogue and less action. Now there’s less dialogue (with some of the worst dialogue ever written) and more action. The writers completely gave up on character arcs (made Sansa’s character arc the trauma she got in Season 5, Jaime went back to his sister for no reason, Arya exists to be OP for no reason, Bran gets the throne for no reason, Jon is revealed to be the heir to the Iron Throne for no reason, Dany burns down a surrendered town for no reason).

I guess I have become invested in the story as a whole rather than just the show. I think season 7 was worse than 8 tbh. 7 was just mediocre build up and the first 3 eps of 8 should've been the end of 7. Then season 8 should've been Dany's decent and should've really showcased the losses they suffered during the long night while trying to take down Cersei. I can't wait to read it when the books come out, I think it'll fill in the gaps that the showed missed even if it doesn't pan out exactly the same way. I really don't understand why people are so upset about Jaime's actions. He was gonna stick by Cersei from the start. It's obvious they were gonna die at the same time.

But also it was a lot of pressure for the actors in their respective roles you need to cut them all some slack not everything is going to be perfect.,the internets reaction became such an echo chamber of Bullshit that I think it really distracted from the fact that it was still better than almost everything else on TV.

The last season was rushed, but the ending was well put together.","Season 8 is by far my least favorite part of the entire run of GOT. For the reasons thousands of us here have said. The only bright spot in it was it gave us one of the best episodes in ep. 2.

Honestly even if 8 were to be turned into a full and proper S8 and S9 (10 epsides each) I would probably still have hated it. I just didn't like how most (if not all) of the character arcs ended. Like GRRM didn't even give us a glimmer of hope. Everything is just heart breaking and bitter. Not bitter-sweet like D&D mentioned numerous times. It's almost too cruel for the fans. I get that D&D got a lot of well deserved shit. But this is GRRM planned ending all along. 

I really hope the try to make a new GOT set in post ASOIAF and it turns out great. It'll probably the only way I can get over the BS they pulled in S8.",Season 8> Seasons 5 and 7.

The reasons i listed above are just a fraction of the problems season 8 had.","There is nothing objective about how ""bad"" something is.","Yes there is. If a story is written in a way that defies logic so frequently to the point where not even the fucking writers can explain it, its objectively bad.","No, that's not all all what objective means.

Expectations is a big part of what threw much of the fandom for a loop. Mind you I'm not a fan of S8 and have felt no desire to rewatch since, but I don't for a second regret watching it originally. Game of Thrones is great show and a fantastic story. In pretty much all aspects save writing it is consistently impressive. Hell maybe you'll even enjoy where the writing goes, I'd say give it a shot.","If you enjoyed watching James Cameron movies purely for the visual aspects, i.e. Avatar, The Abyss, Titanic etc - awesome to watch because of the stunning visuals but really crap content, then you'll probably be ok with the final season.","Some people have said the story flows better if you watch it start to finish vs the 2 year wait we had and all the expectations we built up in our heads. 

At the end of the day, you shouldn’t really allow other people dictate if you will be able to enjoy the show or not.","yes you absolutely should. i wish i could rewatch GOT for the first time. i still rewatch “lost” even with the shit ending, because the first couple seasons are excellent and worth watching at least once. same goes for GOT. first six seasons are great television and even though you know how it ends or at least how the ending was received by audiences, everyone has their own opinion and is entitled to that. 

i hated the ending too but i still plan to rewatch the show when it eventually clouds in my mind because it’s some of the best tv i’ve ever watched, simply put. go watch it, now. form your own opinion. perhaps you will receive it in a more favorable light.","I don't think the ending is as bad as they give it credit for.

There's always going to be whiners of most shows.

The final season was a weak one, but it also was gorgeous to look at so worth the time.

In hindsight I would watch the show first and then read the books which are far more detailed and go a different path because of it.",You could always torrent the show for free.,Read the books. You will be hooked. And will never regret it.,"yes, go ahead and watch. i was in the same boat, just binge watched it all for the first time a couple months ago so was well aware of all the backlash. i still was able to enjoy the series, even though i’m not a fan of the ending either. but i knew it was going to suck and was prepared for that. i think it’s also easier to accept the ending for people who binge watch it all within a short time frame than it was for those who watched the series as it aired and invested years of their lives to watching and waiting. i regularly re-watch the show and certain episodes here and there and love it, although the ending is still disappointing. but overall, i loved the show and still would recommend it.","Are you saying the final season was equal in quality to Avatar? Also, I really liked that movie, but did you think it was crap? The reviews for the final season indicate that it's unwatchably bad.","I bought the first book on Google Play a long time ago. I've read a few dozen pages and enjoyed what I've read but, at the risk of sounding like a moron, I have a hard time committing to reading entire books no matter how much I like them.","
Visually Avatar was great to watch, but typically as a James Cameron movie the acting and dialogue was extremely cheesy and cringeworthy...
That cheese and cringeworthiness possibly equates to the plot of the final season. But it's not just that, it's the fact that B&W quite clearly did not have the ingenuity to continue the story with any element of justice after the books had finished.","I would vote for you to watch the show, because with exception to the last season (arguably last 2 seasons) it really was one of the best shows I have ever seen. I think if you are interested, watch it.","I agree. I don't get people who say Sansa had the best character arc. Her character was actually one of the most ruined characters in season 8 along with Dany, Jon, and Jaime imo, the fact that she ended up QITN doesn't negate that. Sansa is supposed to be a politically savvy and smart person but in season 8 all she does is openly make an enemy out of the most powerful person in the world. Sansa is supposed to be more like Littlefinger. She would have smiled in front of Dany's face and plotted behind her back, not started bickering with her in front of everyone at a welcome feast. Sansa's actions in season 8 make her look like a complete idiot, Arya saying that she's smart doesn't change that fact. She's supposed to be smart and yet Dany had her completely figured out in episode 5 when she's talking to Tyrion, make it make sense.","People say Sansa had the best arc?  Maybe before season 5 or so....

I agree Theon had, arguably, the most complete arc.  But that's not hard given how many arcs were undermined or changed when season 7 rolled around.

Jaime's was incomplete... although I don't think the original intent was for him to ever actually be 'redeemed' at the end to start with.  It was a set up for 'bait and switch' (as often happened in GoT), where he would fail being redeemed and return to Cersei.  But like all things season 7/8, everything is so rushed and forced its confusing and unconvincing.","anyone that says Jaime had a complete character arc is on something strong, but yes - Theon got something worth investing your time in

He lost himself to foolish things but he finds the best version of himself in the end, we see his moral conflict in earlier seasons and he finds a way to reconcile that","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

(Also, here’s to hoping people pirate the ever loving sht out of the prequel so HBO can see what their lack of quality control and allowing those crooks to cut the season down to almost HALF the amount of episodes caused their bottom line.

I just wanted to give some feedback. I think the pianos would fit better with maybe the scenes of Tyrion walking through all the dead bodies and the aftermath but with a massacre I think more of epic or suspension orchestral music. The percussions drums helped build some suspense but I feel like the second the wall burst is when the epic orchestral should come in and then the suspense should be for the battle part and the pianos for the aftermath. Just my opinion though. I know as a creator we tend to beat ourselves up so try not to do that,"I'm trying ahah. It was a first doing something orchestral, next one will be better eventually !

He could tell Jon there about his true heritage if Stannis died/Ned would stop supporting him for some other reason and help to make him a serious contender to the Iron Throne. Probably Ned fulfill his vows the best of his ability as a honourable man and die in some fight behind the wall(maybe persuade Jeor to not make any more deals with Craster). Robb Stark also would perhaps back off with his rebellion and rule the North as warden, Sansa would marry Joffrey, Arya wouldn't be so obssesed with revenge and stay in KL or go back to Winterfell- everything would've changed. The interesting point is how would he react, when Dany finally sails to Westeros(assuming he survives).

I live in MD and we say it all the time instead of birthday.,Didn't one of the characters even say nameday suit? Or am I imagining things lol,"""A name day is a tradition that consists of celebrating the day of the year associated with one’s given name. The concept of name days is similar to the more common birthday, except that the association of a name to a day is entirely arbitrary. Name days (in Hungarian: névnap) are very popular, often as much as a person’s actual birthdate. Hungarians not only have birthday, but nameday as well.""","Unfortunately there aren't really any easy answers to this. I agree with you that Dany's scenes are far more graphic and that they definitely count as rape. However, we watch through the first season of GoT and the only character we really hate in Dany's story is Viserys for some reason. Both he and Drogo sexually abuse Dany, just in different ways, but we are kind of urged by the show to like Drogo because Dany forms a relationship with Drogo.  It inadvertently makes us overlook the fact that he bought her as a slave and raped her every single night for months. It doesn't really make sense, to be honest.

I believe the reason that Sansa's scenes garnered so much more outrage are for probably three reasons: 1)We had been with Sansa for 5 seasons at that point and had grown to care about her. We had just met Dany when she married Drogo. 2) We met Sansa as a child and still viewed her as such. 3) This never happened to Sansa in the books so many fans took her being raped as brutality for the sake of brutality, which it in many ways was. The show as a whole was much less nuanced and much more problematic concerning sexual assault than the books were, and this is one of the times it really shows.","Mainly because they were added scenes. In the books, Sansa isn’t the one to get raped by Ramsey, and Cersei is consensual in having sex next to Joff’s corpse.","The Sansa plotline was extremely problematic because its almost like the writers structured the story in a way to make that particular fucked up thing happen. For the sake of the shock value or whatever. Like, it made zero sense for LF to sell Sansa to the Boltons in exchange for allying with a depleted North. The writers must have really loved Jeyne Poole's story in the books(which says a lot about them too i feel) and surely they wanted to make it happen but they couldn't use Jeyne since she wasn't even a named character in the show, so they wrote this extremely convoluted and nonsensical plot so that Sansa takes her place. 

In contrast it makes perfect sense for a horselord to do what he did to Daenerys, the whole story isn't built for the sake of shock value or whatever. 

People were mad at the Jaime/Cersei scene partly because it seemed like a heavy departure from the books where their encounter is consensual and well, Jaime doing what he did conflates with his ""redemption"" arc. 

Of course there were other factors involved too, the show had way more eyes on it by season 5 compared to the season 1 levels of viewership, i'm sure that played a part too.","To be fair, not that it's right or makes it better, Drogo didn't beat her down mentally. He cared in his Dothraki way. He didn't abuse her in any other way, what he did was what his tribe did for however long. Usually with Dothraki brides who accepted that way of life. Dany was from a more 'civilized' society. To Drogo it was normal and he actually cared about her.",Remind me who raped Cersei?,I agree.,"I think what made Sansas rape scene so intense for some people, including me, was Theon being forced to watch. I feel like I was unconsciously waiting for Ramsay to do something really terrible to her, but didn’t expect the rape while Theon watched. His face and her face and Ramsay’s face all were just incredibly unnerving and made the moment feel crazy uncomfortable 

Although I agree, Danys scene was just was unnerving. But having that third character be in the scene during the rape gave an extra uncomfortable feeling","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

And yet people just brushed her whole arc off because Khal Drogo is hot.","So I completely agree that Sansa returning to WF (at the point she did) was underdeveloped and felt extremely forced.  She was still a naïve 'stupid little girl' less than a few episodes ago... but now that she knows what 'type' of player LF is, and then she lies for LF once, so suddenly she's ready to manipulate and undermine a politically motivated family like the Boltons?  Its not believable.  Its out of character. Its ridiculous.  We needed to see Sansa 'playing the game' much more, becoming (over) confident in her politicking etc, before that could be seen as reasonable.

That said, the motivation for LF to send her, and consequence to Sansa going to WF (her rape), is perfectly consistent with how we understand the characters.  LF is trying to break the alliance between the Boltons and the Lannisters, by having Sansa marry Ramsay he achieves this.  On top of that he doesn't understand how depraved Ramsay actually is, so he wouldn't be expecting Ramsay to be abusive towards Sansa.  Ramsay is of course completely depraved, quite cunning and quite capable of convincing people he is whatever they want to believe he is (heroic, innocent etc)... so him raping Sansa once she is trapped within the walls of WF, in order to conceive a Stark/Bolton child, is well within his character and the story line.  

It also sets up the beginning of Theon's redemption just as effectively as Jeyne Poole.  As well, it sets up potential motivations for a Sansa whose motivations we can question for later conflict (although this is, much like much after season 6, more or less ignored).

It may be 'shocking', but, **aside from Sansa motivations to go to WF in the first place** (which is again rushed and feels forced), its consistent to the story the *show* had set up, and the direction (I think anyways) the *show* was intending to go (until D&D altered story lines and rush finished the job)

The Jaime/Cersei scene is just D&D messing up... their intent was for the scene to be consensual, although I have no idea how they thought they'd execute that with Cersei saying 'no' and Jaime forcing himself on her anyways.

But still, it’s not like having sex with your bride on your wedding night, whether she wants to or not,  was exclusive to his culture. The Lannisters participated in it as well as the Boltons.

It’s a clear abuse of power and I would argue that Dany is full on Stockholm syndrome for Drogo because of how he treats her. It’s in no way a healthy relationship. 

But people don’t like nuance. I know a lot of people who view Dany as this bastion of feminine empowerment in a male-dominated (ish) setting. Whenever I would mention how fucked up her/Drogo’s dynamic was (my ex asked me to go as Drogo while she went as Dany for Halloween and I didn’t like that shit at all, for example) I would get shouted down as trying to belittle her empowerment/agency. It was infuriating. You can be powerful and still be taken advantage of.","I had this feeling that it was both.

Yes, i agree. I think Sansa maturing into a political prodigy is a huge part of her Feast plotline and i suspect the showrunners cut most of it out because they thought it wouldn't go down well on the TV medium. 

>That said, the motivation for LF to send her, and consequence to Sansa going to WF (her rape), is perfectly consistent with how we understand the characters. LF is trying to break the alliance between the Boltons and the Lannisters, by having Sansa marry Ramsay he achieves this.

Here's the thing though: why would LF care about fracturing the alliance between the North and the Crown? The North, after the Red Wedding is super weak while the Crown has both the Tyrells and the Lannisters backing it still. I'd argue LF didn't really stand to gain anything from allying with a Bolton ruled North and in the process of selling Sansa to them, was risking a whole lot for nothing.

Firstly, LF is obsessed with the idea of having Cat(And later Sansa). He views them as ""his"" and i'm not sure it's even in character for him to let Sansa go like that. Secondly, did LF not know about Ramsay though? Ramsay had a pretty terrible rep among Robb's camp, seems like the knowledge of his antics was pretty widespread and something of LF's stature would have heard about.

I would just say Tyrion was a more moral person from a more 'civilized' culture. Just like when the Hound told Arya he should've raped Sansa and finally had a happy moment... but he saved her instead from being raped by the other soldiers.

I guess that's why this all makes more good discussion. It's all very grey.","I think the way they were supposed to portray that was Cersei instigates the whole thing through her actions all the while saying no and something like that is extremely difficult to do right, and the direction and the acting itself totally didn't do it like that so it just comes across as super rapey when it's sorta not supposed to be like that.","Right. Yeah that seemed like rape. 

There’s something called the savage fury fantasy, where women are taken by a muscular brute with some form or amount of force. This is considered erotic rape fantasy for some women and has been a trope central to romance novels for centuries. It’s almost the equivalent of the fight fantasy for men. In other words, women liked to see it, probably more than men. 

Then there’s the horror of being taken by someone like Ramsey. This is considered an adverse rape fantasy for most women. The same way people fantasize about dying in a plane crash or what they would do if their car jumped a bridge guardrail. 

I recall the biggest complaint about Sansa’s rape was that the viewer experiences it through Reek. We got Reek’s emotional reaction to Sansa’s rape instead of Sansa’s emotional reaction.  I don’t really know why that was a complaint though it seems odd. I’m positive that I didn’t want to see Sansa or Ramsey’s face during that whole thing. 

The relationship with Jaime and Cersei is so messed up I can understand why people disregard that rape scene as anything more screwed up than what’s already going on with them.","Yeah the only reason people say her sex with Drogo wasn’t rape is BeCauSe hE wAs GenTle WiTh HeR. Being gentle with a thirteen year old during sex doesn’t changed the fact she was practically forced to marry you. If Khal Drogo was a real gentleman, he would’ve done as Tyrion did and only done it if she wanted to.","I think we have had this debate before, so please note that I don't go into this with any belief that I can change your mind. But I am going to post an excerpt from the Dany chapter in question, as I believe you are portraying the situation VERY differently than the book does. 

> All her life Viserys had told her she was a princess, but not until she rode her silver had Daenerys Targaryen ever felt like one.  
At first it had not come easy. The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on her bottom, hideous and bloody. Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount.  
Even the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.  
Day followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night . . . 

She is in pain from the constant riding. I am sure that having vigorous sex during this time did not help her incredible pain, but you are framing the situation as if he is the cause of all of her pain. 

And also you're framing it as if she was definitely saying no to the sex, even though this isn't indicated by the chapter. She was capable of saying no to him when they were first married, so I always took it to mean that she agreed to have sex with him, but that the touching of her open sores made it very painful for her. 

Of course being 13 and essentially sold to a man means that all the sex, even if consensual is rape, but that means that half of the sex in Westeros is rape, as all the wives are essentially sold to their husband's families, mostly as children. And the other half are selling their own bodies.","> Here's the thing though: why would LF care about fracturing the alliance between the North and the Crown?

I'd argue LF didn't really stand to gain anything from allying with a Bolton ruled North and in the process of selling Sansa to them, was risking a whole lot for nothing. 

LF plan was this.  Give Sansa to the Bolton's, thereby break the alliance between the Boltons and Lannisters.  Then he's sent by the Lannisters to reclaim WF from the Boltons (he has a scene with Cersei in the show explaining this).   This then means he'll control not only the Eerie but also the North... all while still maintaining (at that point) Lannister support.  

On top of that, as you mention, he actually loves Sansa.  So by swooping in with the KotV, he 'saves' Sansa from her enemies and endears himself to her.

>Secondly, did LF not know about Ramsay though? Ramsay had a pretty terrible rep among Robb's camp, seems like the knowledge of his antics was pretty widespread and something of LF's stature would have heard about. 

LF doesn't know anything about Ramsay, other than he is Roose's son.  Ramsay isn't really known by anyone.  Perhaps in the books Ramsay has a rep with Robb and Co., but in the show he doesn't.","The actors and the director have been very clear that they didn't film a rape scene and stills from the scene show a mutual scene.  BUT it was cut in a way that was rapey, apparently accidentally, although how that is possible I have no idea:

There is a whole wiki page on it: https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Breaker_of_Chains/Jaime-Cersei_sex_scene

I find it disturbing that such a thing can even happen.","I don’t understand whether people want rape scenes to be graphic or censored.

Game of Thrones shows Sansa’s clothes being forcibly torn and her being pushed onto a bed then cuts to Theon’s reaction. You can hear her screams but the rest is left up to the viewer’s imagination.

Do you feel strongly that Ned was also not a gentleman? I mean, he did refuse the bedding ceremony in a very gallant move (according to Cat), so he didn't allow other men to rip the clothes off his bride. But they still had sex that night despite the fact that she had wanted to marry his brother, not him. I expect she also said yes, but didn't really want to do it.

Audiences tend to feel incredibly uncomfortable with *any* scene were a 'hero' or otherwise 'innocent' woman (ie. not a villain or antagonist) is physically abused by male characters.  Whether its rape or being beaten up etc.  It makes them feel uncomfortable enough to not like the show/scene after they've seen it.  Its why most of the time shows/movies show a male character in a position of power over the female character, then they'll cut and the next scene you'll see female character crying, or depressed, or scared (etc) with perhaps marks on them.  You know what happened, but without it being shown.  But you won't often see more than a slap, or push, or grabbing the female character.

I believe it was Charlize Theron who had to go to bat to keep her (more violent) fight scenes in Atomic Blonde, even though she 'wins' those fights.  The producers/studio wanted to remove them because they felt the audience wouldn't like how graphically she's beaten up in the fights.","I think censored is better (as a sexual assault victim). Even GoT scenes were occasionally too graphic for me and I had to mute them. Had they not been cut the way they were, I believe GoT would have had *much* more criticism and controversy.

The North was still the largest and most powerful kingdom in all of Westeros. And ultimately what matters was this was another step 'up the ladder' for LF. 

>what if Roose snitched 

Roose had no idea what LF plan was (he thought LF and the Eerie was allying with him), and had no particular reason to 'snitch' on LF (the Lannisters were never going to aid Roose even if the North turned on him).  However he needed Sansa to legitimize his hold over the North, not only because he held WF, but because he had participated in the Red Wedding and was seen as a traitor.  So to him its a huge boon to have Sansa marry Ramsay.

Aside, 'what ifs' could apply to any of LF plans (or anyone's really).  'What if' Olenna had snitched on him (or vice versa), or the assassin sent to kill Bran had snitched. etc.  LF (and others) are constantly taking risks... his are just weighted and calculated.   

LF plan was one that *seemed* to benefit everyone.  Roose legitimizes his hold on the North... Cersei sends a *perceived* ally to take back WF from the Boltons.  But in the end, it only really benifited him.

Edit: didn't finish thoughts...","I don't see any point it debating it or defending it. It is what it is, a rapey scene.

Now I still don't know what to make of it, so, yes, I largely ignore it, beyond taking it as a testament to how screwed up the relationship is.  On a meta level it is evidence of the writers either trying to make Jaime's character darker for reasons that I simply do not understand, or simply wanting to shock and pushing all the boundaries with this result.","> The North was still the largest and most powerful kingdom in all of Westeros.

Not true at all, The Reach is far more powerful than the North in almost every single way.

Roose knew LF was harboring Sansa, he could have easily told as much to the Lannisters is what i'm saying. I'm also not sure if he ""needed her"" in the grand scheme of things since all the other Northern lords just seemed like cowards afraid of the big bad Boltons.","In the show they have a scene with Roose and Ramsay explaining the vastness and strength of North.  Perhaps in the books the Reach is the most powerful, but that's never explained in the show.  Aside, LF is already secretly allied with Olenna at this point anyways, as they worked together to murder Joffrey.

Whether one feels Roose absolutely 'needed' Sansa or not, is up for personal choice, but the show made it rather clear that was the designs of marrying Sansa to Ramsay, to legitimize the Bolton hold on the north.  Its a perfectly logical given the politics of the show and the North.",">In the show they have a scene with Roose and Ramsay explaining the vastness and strength of North.

I do remember that scene and Roose was only talking about the land mass the North covers. Most of which is a snowy wasteland, the Reach is the bread basket of Westeros and it can raise the most men by far of any of the kingdoms. It also has one of the 3 biggest fleets in Westeros in the Redwyne fleet(while the North has little to no naval power). I don't see why any of these details would be different in the show anyways.","I really don't know what else to tell you... you seem convinced to not want to accept LF plan.  And that's your prerogative.  Whether the Reach or the North is actually *the* most powerful kingdom really isn't what matters.  Its minutia.  Simply chaulk that up to a poor description on my part if you like.  

What matters is the North is still an influential power, and by giving Sansa to the Bolton's, LF would not only break the Bolton/Lannister alliance... he could take WF with Lannister approval, now giving him direct control over 2 kingdoms, and an alliance with 2 other powers (the Lannisters and Tyrells). 

> I don't see why any of these details would be different in the show anyways.

the show doesn't detail anything about the Reach, (its strength, its fleet etc) other than its and influential kingdom and the bread basket of Westeros.  We shouldn't expect the audience to know that.  And regardless its not the important part.

LF is continuing to sow chaos so he can continue to take steps up the ladder, and take more and more control.

I don't expect you to accept LF plan (its the story tellers responsibility to convince an audience that something is 'true'... not ours to explain it to each other), but its worth noting the show isn't the book, and its strays from the books in many regards.  Its only required to stay consistent within the story it tells (which it still manages to fail spectacularly at, at many points), but not necessarily with the book.","The first three are terrific.

Jorah might feel he has no choice but to walk away from Dany of his own volition, and the shock of that might also get Dany to see what she’s done. Or alternatively, she could continue in tyrant mode and declare that no-one walks away from her etc.

I’d like to think Jorah would be very quick to confront Dany. But then, I thought Jon would have been quicker to do so... Yes, she is the queen, to whom Jorah - and Jon - have sworn themselves. And they both love her. But duty to the *realm* is something Jon has always taken seriously, and Jorah would presumably also feel this way, given his sense of regaining his honour. I guess it comes back to those themes of too many oaths, and the tension between love and duty.

Re Jon - i guess being younger than Jorah, he’s conceivably less sure of his choices. Plus the last time Jon faced an impossible choice, but believed he chose rightly, his brothers killed him for it - so yeah, you can imagine he would feel very ‘stuck’ in this situation, and constantly doubt what his instincts tell him. Jorah has more life experience than Jon (they’ve both had eventful lives, Jorah’s just been around longer) - so I feel Jorah wouldn’t harbour that degree of doubt about confronting Dany.

That doesn’t mean it wouldn’t be *agonising* for Jorah to witness Dany burning King’s Landing... it would tear his soul apart I think. But I don’t think there’s any way he could remain silent. And if Dany couldn’t or wouldn’t accept this, perhaps Jorah would view the Dany he loved as being dead, & mourn her, & not care too much if he lived or died.

The flip side of all this, of course, is if Jorah hadn’t died, would Dany have even burnt King’s Landing? It’s Dany’s losses that seem to push her over the edge, and possibly Jorah’s devotion could have brought her back from the brink?

You know, there’s someone else I just thought of who might have confronted Dany - and that’s Davos. Sure, he has no influence when it comes to the Queen, unlike Jon and Jorah. So Dany probably wouldn’t listen to anything he had to say to her. But Davos has an incredibly strong moral compass. He’s demonstrated many times that he’s not afraid to speak out against injustices - even when it is dangerous to do so. Remember when Stannis looks at the imprisoned Davos and asks in astonishment: “Have you so little regard for your own life?” (And Davos *still* goes on to disobey Stannis by orchestrating Gendry’s escape). Would Davos stay silent in the aftermath of the burning of KL? Surely not. It never sat right with me that we didn’t get even a short scene of Jon with Davos agonising over the right thing to do, or a scene where they say farewell to one another.","It would have been interesting. Perhaps he would be so blown away, his mind would just flip, and he would be the trusted one who gutted her, not Jon.",Jorah was ride or die. I honestly think he’d defend her even harder than Jon did during that Tyrion prison cell convo. Would he have misgivings? Yes. Would love overcome them? Also yes.,It never would have happened if jorah was alive though. When she lost him she lost the most important person in her entire life.,"At that point, I can confidently say he'd be done with Dany.  Despite his love for her, he would have recognized that she had made a terrible and irreversible mistake, and probably see that she is starting to become more like her father.","In the original outline they had Jorah decided to join the Night's Watch for having believed in someone who brought destruction to the capital. I think he probably would do nothing, maybe advocating for Tyrion's life because he would know that he is right.","He'd see her for the lunatic she turned into, there's nothing that could justify a pointless mass murder at that level. I can even see him agreeing with Tyrion in that she needed to be killed before she could go any further with her crazy ideas for their world.","The burning of King's Landing won’t likely happen if Jorah lives, so...","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

There is a *lot* of political maneuvering and intrigue.  That's really what they are about.   A large part of the story is the war between family focused factions for the Iron Throne. But you are seeing it through the point of views of key characters, so it is more individual than nation state.  There is a bit of international politics in Dany's later chapters, but it is not the main thrust of the books.","I'm no expert as I'm only 200 pages into the first book as of today.

I just finished the show like a week ago and immediately bought the first book and I'm hooked so quickly on the books. I've always heard GRRM can be worse than Tolkien with being overly descriptive and flat sometimes while setting a scene but with the perspective changing every chapter I think it really really works and is way better than what Tolkien does to set up a scene. I say finish the show because there are obviously vast differences and then pick up the books.","Both the earlier seasons and the books have a lot of political maneuvering and intrigue, it's the Game of Thrones after all... the books go way more in detail about it than the show does and i found it to be very engrossing.

It'll never happen, but it would be really nice if once GRRM is done with the books, a limited series or a short run of films could tell the story cinematically in a proper way.  
But, we got what we got, and what we got was shafted.  It's clear, D & D lost the character's voices when they ran out of books.  They lost interest when they got hired to do Star Wars.  They rushed to a stopping point when the end was in sight rather than devote the same time and care that went into adapting the written word.  Then came the only piece of poetic justice the world will receive from this whole debacle.  The Back Fire Rebellion we will call it.

1. Euron's actor, Pilou Asbæk, has stated that he was disappointed at how his character was so little like the book's version. he also has commented on how stupid it was that his character was just used as the Plot Reaper and that he was the reason his character got that last line that he did (the scene was originally supposed to have him laying there dead, but Pilou felt that that didn't fit for the character he was playing so he deliberately bungled every take until they let him talk.)

2. Lena Headey's made it clear that she was really displeased with how Cersei died (With her and Maisie both agreeing that Arya should have done it.) Lena's also unhappy about a scene that got cut (Cersei was supposed to miscarry right at the end of Season 7. That's why she reneges on the deal and goes all in on fucking over Daenerys.)

3. Carice van Houten, Mel's actress, has stated that she liked the ending... because so much intricate planning did devolve into nonsense just like in real life. I'm not sure if this is disappointment, but it is definitely a backhanded compliment.

4. Jacob Anderson and Nathalie Emmanuel have straight refused to give their opinion on the last season. Probably because they have strong ones.

5. Nikolaj has tried to be subtle with his disappointment about Jaime's arc, but he has given the indication in several interviews that he's not really happy about what happened to Jaime.

There's also plenty of actors who were upset before season 8:

1. Joe Dempsie, Gendry's actor, repeatedly ""joked"" about how he didn't think season 7 had any character development. At all.

2. Stephan Dillion, Stannis' actor, regarded his time on the show as a disheartening experience and that he wished that he hadn't done it (He stated this mainly because he found the direction and writing to not be very explanatory in his scenes and Liam Cunningham, Davos' actor, was the main person willing to help him out.

3. Natalie Dormer was irritated about how Highgarden and the Tyrells in general got treated in season 7. She has attempted to say it was partially because of how much she got into Margaery's head, but still...

4. Sibel Kekikli, Shae's actress, felt that Shae testifying at the trial was out of character for who she had portrayed for the past 4 seasons since Shae was a more heroic character who was actually close to Tyrion and Sansa in the show.

5. Ian McElhinney, Barristan's actor, was a tad peeved at getting his character's story cut down in the show and tried to argue against killing his character off that early (In the books, Barristan has thus far made it past the pit fight/dragon ride time.) D&D proceeded to mock him for how much he cared in a public interview.

Yeah... there's been a lot of signs of issues for a while now...","That last q&a they did, if to be believed makes me think they deserve all the crap they are getting. It seemed they had no business being on the project at all, which reinforces the fact that HBO and George need to take some of the blame for letting them on at least.","For what we got of it, yes.

The problem with the last two seasons  was largely that everything was too condensed, not necessarily that the plot was terrible.","How would you rank the seasons? I'm genuinely curious.

It just has more payoffs like BoB so people like it more.",I’m trying to figure out why anyone who hated the vast majority of a TV series would spend their time whinging about it on a sub specifically devoted to it.,"Sixth season suffered from the same problem as the ones around it, you could just feel the writer's hand on everything.","I honestly can't rank the seasons, but I feel like I can rank the ""acts"" of the series. I put seasons 1-4 together, 5-6, and 7-8. I'd say 1-4 is tops, 7-8 just under that, and 5-6 at the bottom. But being ranked lowest doesn't mean I didn't like them. My favorite episode is probably S6 finale. Season 8 definitely had it's flaws, but it also had some of the most breathtaking cinematography I've ever seen in any media. People's careers definitely did not need to be destroyed over it.","You're crying about a TV show.

Cry about it, because it's going to do nothing.

I say; shut up.

Imagine downvoting KEKW","Gotta agree to disagree. Fourth seasons the only one that combines the big plot and action episodes of the later seasons with the great writing and progression of the first 3 seasons. Literally kick starts with Joffreys death and the last half of the season every episode is amazing. Tyrions trial. Oberyn vs the mountain. Nights watch battle. The best finale of the show behind winds of winter. Compare this to say season 3 which had basically 2 big episodes (Red wedding and the episode where Dany gets the unsullied and the rest of the episodes were great but not mindblowing). Same with season 2 only big episodes were Blackwater and the finale. The rest were great but a lot of them could be called build up.

Through season 4 though there are some of the best story arcs too like Arya and the Hound, tyrions downfall, the nightswatch conflict, Bran trying to find the 3 eyed raven. Honestly every season upto 4 had 2 or 3 really big episodes but from what ive said season 4 had at least 5. Only weakness in the writing was how Yara wasnt able to retrieve Theon from Ramsey but besides that i dont think it meanders when it has the best story pacing of any season. Of course in my opinion i guess.","Lmao who said I downvoted you? And who said I was crying? Check my history, friend. No complaints coming from me. Yet here you are, whining about whining. The irony is hilarious.","I downvoted my own comments for your satisfaction.

You're all just so cleaver. ;)","Yeah i guess agree to disagree.  I dont place as big an emphasis on ""big episodes"" as you as I tend to find a lot of them harder to buy into than the simpler character driven stuff.  I do love Tyrion's trial though because its literally perfect.

Dont get me wrong i like 4 but it just feels like the story was reaching for places to go.   War of the Five Kings made it feel like you were watching History.  4 feels more like TV.  Really good TV, but still just TV.",I can see your point of view. Season 1 was a very contained plot with Ned Stark so it didnt feel like the plot was reaching from anywhere. The plot of the seasons 2 and 3 being the war of the five kings made the story very easy to consume like you were witnessing a historical war play out and the plot progression felt more natural. I guess thats why you feel it meanders in the 4th season since it doesnt have an overall focus thats quite as strong as the previous seasons. Must be why you feel the plot was reaching cos it was getting taken from so many different places that dont really tie together the same way.,"**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

I really hope Martin finishes the last 2 books left in the series before he’s gone cuz he’s like 80 years old or someone :/,"The books largely focus on the story of the entire Seven Kingdoms + Essos, more than just a handful of characters. The story is told from the lens of the main characters, but the scale is just on another level in the books. 

Also, there is more magic realism in the books that wasn't captured by the show. If you like the blending of historical fiction mixed with cosmic horror and surreal fantasy, the books are definitely for you.","More characters, yes, but also better characters.  What you see on screen are caricatures that pick up a couple of traits from each book characters.  Deeper character arcs.  Clearer motivations.  More complex schemes.  Creepier magic and mysticism. A far deeper and more alive world.   The show is somewhere between cliffnotes and fanfic.  The books are the complete story.",thank you! I’ll give them a read,"Or try the audiobooks.  I don’t think much of the narration, but you can listen during the daily commute!","I noticed that there are some prequels as well, do you recommend starting with those or just starting with the Game of Thrones book first and going from there?","Hmm...I would read the books first and then the prequels, I think.  But it probably doesn’t matter too much if you have seen the show.  You can get through the Dunk and Egg books pretty quickly, particularly if you find the graphic novels.  Fire and Blood is kind of a history.

In the entertainment industries for example (tv/film/gaming), artist generally are seen as production jobs and they are subject to relatively low wages when you factor in how many hours they're expected to put in, especially during crunch times (this is particularly notorious for the gaming industry).

My advice to people, if you appreciate an artist online and you want to support them, the best thing to do is find out if they have a Patreon or merch store and throw a couple of bucks their way.",That's actually a great way to complement someone.

Can't wait for the WOW to see GRRMs version.","True! It’s like a Harry and Neville situation. 
Theon also had the best redemptive arc in the show imo, Jamie’s is second (disregarding the season that shall not be named ofc)",Yeah but he got his dick cut off so it kinda evens out.,"In the books Theon has also raped many women, and killed more than 2 children. After “taking” Winterfell, he was there for a while with his men, and killed many people to make a statement. He also threatened the northern lors that he would hang a lord’s child/hostage for each day that the northern army was in front fo Winterfells gates. That same night though the Bolton Bastard Reek comes to “save” him and then takes winterfell and the woman Theon was fucking then castrates him and makes him the new Reek.

The books are great and the stories individually are fantastic!","So True - In season 2 Arya talked about Dragons and Aegon Targaryen and his sister's to Tywin at the Harrenhal  Castle and in S8 Arya didn't talk to Daenerys Targaryen.... not one time about anything! The only time Ayra did anything regarding a dragon in season 8 was when she looked up to the sky in amazement when she saw Drogon for the 1st time in E1 and that's it....

And Arya never talked to Jon about being Aegon Targaryen... the rightful heir to Rule the 7 Kingdoms!!!!!!!!!! Jon also never told  Daenerys that he knew Aemon Targaryen and Aemon's final vote was what made him Jon Snow the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch!

I of course respect your opinion, but I just don’t get that. 

There are so many seasons of a show you enjoyed until it took a downturn. Those seasons still contain all the things you loved about them before; the content hasn’t changed. 

I get that knowing it all leads to a lackluster conclusion is a bummer, but I personally will never *not* enjoy the Battle of Blackwater Bay, the Massacre at Hardhome, the Mountain vs. the Viper, The Battle of the Bastards, the Battle at Castle Black, etc. and most of all, the incredible political drama of those early seasons.

For all their failings towards the end, they did give us several seasons of groundbreaking TV, and the whole “the ending ruined everything that came before it” thing has never made sense to me.

No matter how good the hors-d'ouevres and the main course were, no matter how spot-on the wine pairing for each dish, no matter how elegant the experience, it still ends with shit. And the worst part is, in order to get the complete dinner, *you have to eat it.*","Because you realize that almost EVERYTHING in the show ultimately has no point in the end...

Kinda like when The Last Airbender hit theaters and I defended that trash film.,I was a total GOT nerd till about half way through season 8. Episode 3 insulted our intelligence and everything after that just insulted all the character arcs that took years to develop.,"I havent rewatched the show ever since I saw the finale either. Weird cuz I rewatched it multiple times while waiting for new seasons(7 &8). Tbh As far as the Starks storyline goes, its pretty consistent with what they wanted right from the beginning. Although how they did Bran and Dani's storyline was just so random and out of the blue. Dani wanted to be ""home"" all this time but she decided to burn the whole thing? Just makes nosense whatsoever. But first few seasons are still great I guess.","same, never watched it.","You know what you are right, the first few seasons were great. There were some fantastic moments. My problem is I find it very difficult to watch all that awesome tv again knowing how terribly it will end. The characters became so dumb by season 8. They completely ruined Varys as character as he started doing silly shit he never would of done in the first few seasons. I could go on and on but I won't lol.

Listen I understand it's very difficult to finish a big show with an ending that pleases everyone e.g. Dexter, Lost etc but the final season of GOT was just plain brutal from episode 3 onwards. Such a bad ending.","The ending ruins the entire show. All the plot points all the buildup with the white walkers in the north all the whispers of prophecy and the long night... all unraveled. Battle of bastards, hardhome, hell Danny burning the lannisters after the sack of high garden, oberyn getting his eyes squished... all great stuff. 

But it doesn't mean ***jack shit*** if the ending sucks that bad. I don't care to rewatch any of that shit past YouTube clips I may show to a friend for a memory here or there.","The point is that so many of the ""good things"" in the early season where setting up plot points that I now know had no good payoff.

So, all the ""good stuff"" in the early seasons just serves to constantly remind me of how shittily it all ends.

Fuck season 8...it ruined the whole god damn show for me. I'll never watch it again.

In fact I quit after episode 4. I won't even finish the trash that is season 8. As far as I'm concerned the show ended at season 7",I think I will get a pizza instead lol.,How they ruined Varys as a character still stings.,Only the voices inside my head whenever I look at newspaper now haha,Haha thank you.,What is your spaghetti policy here?,"Every story line just seems pointless and hollow now. Before everything seemed to be leading up to a huge payoff, but what we got? What's the point?",That’s the true tragedy of all this. That the ending essentially negates all of the great television that led up to it and a show that held so much rewatch value now holds none of that.,Say it louder for the people in the back!,Yes. All those theories and pouring over details. Also way to destroy a beautiful character arc in Jaime.,"Seasons 1-5 are fantastic, I even really like season 6 despite that being the point where it all started going downhill. I watched those seasons probably 10+ times! Except now I can’t bring myself to watch anything GoT related, it just makes me so sad. 8 years of my life invested in that show all for nothing :(","I don't disagree with you on that. I did my best to stay optimistic during the final season, but it got to a point where optimism just wasn't an option.

I definitely agree on Varys, too. He was amongst the smartest, most pragmatic characters in the show for a long time, and to end his story the way they did was a slap in the face.

I do get what you're saying though. I suppose it all comes down to preference (as does anything related to TV/movies/books/whatever). I'm able to watch the show all the way through despite the...sad downhill trip it made towards the end, but I get why others might choose not to.

Thanks for actually talking with me and not seeing a glimmer of positivity towards the show and immediately reacting in a negative way, haha.","And I totally respect that. You make good points. When I initially replied I was genuinely curious why people felt that an ending can ruin an entire work, because I’ve never really felt that way about something. 

I still haven’t felt that way personally, but I now see why someone would. 

One thing that can be agreed on all the way around is the ending.  I too was mad as shit that they didn’t explain ANY of the fantastical elements. None. At all. That still hurts.","For me, the show ended the moment dany set foot on a ship and sailed towards westeros. That scene was just such a high, a complete climax to everything they were building towards. Id rather the rest be left to the imagination of the viewers. Seven wasnt a bad season at all, I just feel like the end of season six is a great place to stop for rewatching purposes.",https://youtu.be/jAhKOV3nImQ,"Mine is Daenerys' character complete toilet flush! Even if Bran had to have his pointless ass on the throne, I wish they would have made her go ""home"" to Meeran where she was loved and adored (sides the Masters, of course). After Winterfell gave her so much rejection and complete ""oh well"" attitude when she lost so much to help THEIR cause, just let her decide to leave, realize Westeros was not where she was meant to rule. Be a happy, full-circle ending for her.","That is my sentiment exactly. It's difficult to end a good show in a way that pleases most but D&D gave us an ending that simply insults our intelligence. The payoff was simply brutal. All the theory GOT videos on youtube had waaaaaaay better idea's than what we got in the end. I wished they had of looked at a few of those videos or even continued 3-4 seasons longer. Oh well too late for that now, it is what it is :/.","Yes, you perfectly worded how I feel. I get a pit in my stomach thinking about how excited I was for The Battle of Winterfell, practically shaking during the intro. And then nothing happened. Nobody died except for the one person I didn’t want to die that soon, The Night King. Wtf!!!","Part of GRRM's charm is that everything doesn't end in a satisfying way so I get that side of things but sometimes it HAS to end in a satisfying way otherwise you're just left pissed off.

I'm all for Jaime and Cersei's ending, think that's going to be similar to how GRRM would have done it. Same with Jon, Dany, Sansa and possibly Jorah IMO, albeit with a bit more depth. Other than that though, I think they butchered Tyrion, Varys, LF etc. and had way too much of characters like Lyanna Mormont and Bronn",D&D fucked up!,The story arc for Jaime could of been sooo perfect and it looked like it was going in the right direction. Jaime was becoming a good person through lose and hardship. Then bam! All of a sudden he is running off to kings landing and dies in the dumbest way ever. It was like a ten year old took over the writing. Just brutal and how D&D never thought for a second this was a terrible conclusion to Jaimes story arc just makes me shake my head. It’s pretty fucking obvious.,"No problem. You approached me in a civilized way so I figured I would return the same. 
I am very conflicted at times when it comes to GOT but the final season just stung so bad. It's hard for me to stick on an old episode and forget that. Maybe one day I will but for now the wounds are still fresh.","Yeah that was a great moment. While season 7 did start to show signs of the show's eventual decline, it had some really great high points for me... Namely the revelation/confirmation of R+L=J

The plot still had promise then. God damn shame they threw it all away for what amounted to a gotcha gimmick...smh","Don't know if 3-4 more seasons was necessary but I think they could have taken their time with seasons 7 and 8, making them a full 10 episodes each and taken an extra season to flesh out the NK, Bran and Dany's endings.",That same pit in your stomach disappointed feeling is how I feel with SW episode 8. GoT was also just an absolute disgrace. I'm shocked either or those was allowed to be presented to the public tbh. Absolutely awful stuff.,"Real bad. 

No one wants the boxsets anymore either. I had friends that had never seen fantasy shows in their lives liking game of thrones and talking about the boxsets they'd be getting. Now all of us collectively said ""fuck that"" and never want to speak of shit of thrones again. What an absolute disgrace and disaster.","They didn’t even have to do anything else. He was redeemed, he selflessly went to Winterfell, he had honor. All he had to do was kill Cersei AS WAS PROPHECY and it would’ve been literally perfect.","I agree though, literally makes no sense. The choice was completely obvious and there was nothing to gain by ruining all of that.",You have every right to feel that way. The ending was appaling and ruins the series. There's no rewatch value in it for me and a lot of others feels the same fuck that series. Ruined the entire show. The show has amazing parts yeah but it's all just overshadowed by shit now.,"That’s probably my biggest complaint. The fact that Jon’s parentage, for as big of a deal as it was made to be, had absolutely zero consequence on the greater story.

There are so many loose that might not get addressed for another 30 years.

There is no way Arya is actually Arya. After she supposedly beat the waif she immediately healed from the stab wound in her belly, she had no withdrawal symptoms from quitting milk of the poppy (opioids) cold turkey, she drank beer, and she became right handed.","It’s a very long tl;dr, sorry. I did my best:

Basically the author wants to keep as much of Arya’s season 7 plot with one very large change: it’s not Arya.

Arya dies in season 6 and the Waif takes her face, though the audience doesn’t know it. Waif!Arya has been hired by Littlefinger, first to avenge Carleton by killing the Freys, then to go to Winterfell and help him consolidate power in his ultimate goal of sitting on the Iron Throne with Sansa by his side.

Waif!Arya undermines Sansa’s authority and Littlefinger uses this to convince Sansa that Jon and Arya are plotting to replace Sansa as Lady of Winterfell with Arya (as she’s Jon’s favorite sister). 

Sansa is suspicious of Littlefinger and begins investigating his claims off screen - comparing old and new Arya’s handwriting, etc.

Eventually Littlefinger realizes Bran is a threat to his plan with his greenseer-3EC powers and orders Waif!Arya to kill him. Sansa, accompanied by Pod and Brienne, burst in just in time to save Bran and kill Waif!Ary. A horrified Sansa peels Arya’s face off, revealing the Waif. Littlefinger is accused, evidence is presented, and Sansa kills Littlefinger.","Littlefinger is aware of arya visiting the vale in season 4 and arranged for her to be followed.
LF pays the faceless men to kill arya and take her mask. Waif actually kills arya but it happens off screen so the scenes wouldn't change and the audience wouldn't know. LF hires waif offscreen
Waif as arya still kills house frey for LF as revenge for catelyn. 
LF wants to destabilise sansa and so gets waif to act hostile. The scenes in season 7 now make sense. 
LF offscreen orders waif to kill bran but is stopped and killed by brienne, pod and sansa.
Sansa finds masks and notes from LF and confronts him.
LF reveals that arya was dead all along, at his bidding. Sansa kills him.",I wouldn’t call her a Mary Sue,"Maisie has often said that occasionally they had to shoot her right-handed due to angle issues or a stunt that required her to use the strength of her right hand.I assume it was the odd camera angle that made her right handed with the sea captain...but THAT was **before** the stabbing.  When she escaped the Waif by hoisting herself with her right hand over the balcony, she obviously needed full strength.

By killing Beric, and then bringing him back the Lord of Light is introduced himself to Arya and the Hound.

For Arya this is the first time she has seen something real at least when it comes to Death.

The horrible battle tactics at the battle of Winterfell end of the dumbed down dialogue for not only the intelligent characters but all of them","In terms of Jaime and Tyrion, it is mainly a comparison between the complex characters of the books, and the rather one-dimensional caricatures in the show, and particularly the later seasons.  It is not just about running out of material, because they began changing the Lannisters (and Jon for that matter)  long before that happened.  Jaime is deliberately darkened and his plot lines in the Riverlands are removed to make him a prop for Cersei.  Tyrion goes from bitter, revenge obsessed and rather disturbing schemer to the audience surrogate and good guy fool.  Jon goes from someone who is quite ruthless in the cause of good to a white washed character who can’t tell a lie.  The show characters take an aspect of the book character and make the character all about that.  

As for poor writing, Other posts consider this at length.  Effectively, there was also a great drop in complexity between the first 2-3 seasons and the last 2 seasons.  The dialogue losses crispness, begins to sound very modern, and by the end involves characters asserting things that do not actually match what they are doing.  Individual scenes become focal points, with writing seemingly designed around those set pieces.  Actions no longer have consequences - Ramsay can flat out murder Roose and Cersei can blow the Sept and no one blinks an eye.  Plot lines are dropped.  Characters change personalities to meet predetermined ends.  The list goes on.",I think once they ran out of book material they struggled and didn't really know what they were doing.,"Anything and everything the sand snakes said, the acting was equally as bad. Dont get me wrong, the one who gave Bronn the antidote is absolutely gorgeous, seriously good eye candy, its just terrible to listen to.

What I mean by the first is that the show runners clearly wanted to get the big events over and done with and basically only showed those with little build up or follow up in the the minute details.  On the character side it felt to me that many of the characters became npcs in their own stories, particularly Jon. Also I didnt particularly enjoy the Jon and Dany romance. There was no real build up like witg jon and ygrritte","It went from being character-based to spectacle-based.

The last good advice Tyrion gave Daenerys was when Tyrion told Daenerys not to fly North with her Dragons and rescue Jon and company beyond the wall. That was a stupid plan from the beginning.... who cares what Cersei thinks or if she is on their side... Daenerys didn't even rescue Jon .... Benjen rescued Jon.

If Daenerys didn't try to rescue Jon beyond the wall she would still have her 3 dragons alive and the Night King wouldn't have a Wight Dragon to destroy the wall and travel South.

Also, he saved her bestie from being stabbed in the fighting pit arena.  But I think both of those things happened before he was her official hand.

The main way Tyrion pissed me off was his handling of the whole Shae situation.

He loved her, but not enough to run away with her like she wanted before he married Sansa.

So when she turned on him during the trial over Joffrey’s murder and then proceeded to fuck his father it was hard for me to feel bad for him.  

Then he strangled Shae and killed his dad on his way out of town.  Something his dad deserved but not Shae.  I guess she should’ve left town too when she had the chance, but love and jealousy obviously made her too stubborn and once T was arrested she was just doing what she thought would keep her alive.","The Peter principal

Cersei fails at basically everything she does, it just so happens that she fails upwards.

Still, take an upvote. You put a lot of effort in to your post and that is respectable.",I think he blowing up the Sept is a good example of why she is not a good ruler. It's the equivalent of the Vatican and the Sparrow (which she put into power) is the Pope. She blew it up for her own selfish reasons and it had nothing to do with hurting Tommen. Tommen wasn't being hurt he was just drifting away from Cersei's control. In the 'real world' there would be actual consequences for doing this. All she ever does on the show is look at short term goals and doesn't think about long term consequences. The show did a terrible job (plain ignoring) what would happen to her after shew blew it up.,"Compared to the rest of her family, she's a bit dull. Though to be fair, her brother is an extremely likeable and charismatic dwarf, her other brother gets a cool redemption arc, her dad  is brilliant and evil, and her oldest son is one of the most despicable characters in TV history. Tommen is a bit dull though and we barely see Myrcella. Cersei does have her moments though. Blowing up the Sept was interesting.","Shes quite literally in my opinion one of the dumbest characters in the show, she never thinks ahead, and never thinks of the consequences of possible actions. She was in power and was slightly challenged by Margery, so she puts the high sparrow into power, dethroning herself, and losing her child to a cult. And after realizing how much she fucked up, just kills everyone and influences her son to suicide in doing all of this. Cersei is unimaginably simple minded, she doesn't pay attention to anything, she drinks and commands things because she is rich and has power thanks to her father. Her main problem is that she thinks of every situation as an act of war, which never helps her considering she has no knowledge when it comes to war. Even in earlier seasons before she becomes ruler she still sucks at trying to be clever, I recall a moment where she questions littlefingers loyalty considering his love of catelyn and when littlefinger brings up incest she threatens to have him killed, she starts fights she never wins and this reason alone is why she is a terrible leader.","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

She ""loves"" her family but oh wait what about her little brother Tyrion who never caused her ill yet she constantly hates on him except the times she cried a few crocodile tears because she needed his abilities, the same way she uses sex to manipulate Jaime into helping her do crazy shit like kill Arya. She's cunning, but she has a low cunning, as Tyrion so rightly puts it. Anything that goes wrong she just blames it on everyone but herself. The only reason she comes off smelling like a rose is because showrunners decided not to do this logical consequences bullshit anymore in latter seasons, so she got off scot free.","I wonder how many of the 9/11 terrorists felt their actions were necessary to defend their homes and families.  If so, were their actions defensible and morally questionable to?

Funny how when we find a character/story interesting or compelling, moral and ethics shift.

Just because Cersei isn't a 'moustache twirling' villain... who actually has a motivation outside of just being evil for the sake of evil... doesn't make her actions or character 'morally grey'.","Just curious, what consequences for blowing up the sept were you looking for and who/ where would they be coming from?","OK so for starters: she blew up the sept. BOOM. Religion was everything in a medieval era - it literally governed their every day. How do everyone from the smallfolk up to the highest nobility be like ""wtf you attacked our god? eh ok I guess""? There would be religious-based riots especially when the Faith has been the ones actually feeding the smallfolk of King's Landing. Gold Cloaks would have had to be ordered out to enforce increasingly tyrannical suppression, and there would be fighting every single day between them and the Warrior Sons, because it is impossible for the Sept karbloomy to wipe out every single Faith follower despite the show conveniently forgetting they exist after the karbloomy.

Then the nobility. Like, who the fuck does this shamed woman who btw is still accused of treason, incest, adultery and a whole host of crimes, now adding domestic terrorism, deicide AND KINSLAYING to the list, think she is? Before Jaime returned from the Riverlands with the Lannister army, she had exactly one(1) bodyguard - Gregor Clegane (and btw, in a superstitious world where Qyburn lost his Citadel chain for necromancy experimentation, how the fuc did no one immediately accuse Cersei of witchcraft and dark magic when he was clearly called Gregor Clagaine in the show? In the books at least they pretend he's a nobody called Robert Strong), all the Kingsguard have been replaced by people loyal to the Faith, and given Tommen was in the Red Keep at the time of the Karbloomy, logically most of them would have survived and would never not in a million years supported a sinner like Cersei no matter how loud she screams that she is Queen. Any remaining nobility would have immediately deserted Cersei after the walk of shame, but after she blew up the center of religion? And her son the supposed king dead? As well as half his government and his family by marriage? They would have scrambled to have her convicted on the spot and executed to a) pacify the smallfolk and b) because they'd know a person who so openly destroys a marriage alliance and her entire family can never be trusted to respect the feudal system they all operated under. Oathbreaker, kinslayer, kingslayer. At the very least, even if that didn't happen straight away, they would have made contact with the remaining Faith leadership and tried to take control of their power too, and perhaps yes, triggered another war of succession. But make no mistake, Cersei wouldn't have been crowned with no objections, magic zombie bodyguard or no. She was a consort, not a regnant, even if she'd been regent for a brief (and disastrous) spell, and after her public shaming, there was no way she would have wielded power in her own name (in the books, this was very clearly shown: she had to ask her uncle to do things for her, talk to Tommen for her to name Robert Strong to the Kingsguard, ask Kevan to summon Taena back to court etc. She can't command things done herself anymore). Even Aerys, who had the backing of 300 years of Targ kings behind him, was overthrown when he went too crazy for anyone else to handle, what more Cersei, an adulterous incestuous kinslaying whore who didn't have a drop of royal blood, who was *openly shamed* to strip her of her perceived might? Remember, power is a shadow on the wall, it resides where people believes it resides. The whole point of Cersei's walk of shame is to lower her so that the smallfolk see her as just another whore, shorn of her crown and her riches, what more the nobility? Once that impression is made, it's very hard to wipe away.

Oh and you know what? Olenna Tyrell would have immediately rallied the bannermen of the Reach prior to starving out Kings' Landing and she would have won, because the memory of their precious Queen Margaery, who cared for them when Cersei never did, was blown up by Cersei. That would have won Olenna a lot of sympathy points and given her a righteous cause the Tyrell bannermen (including one of the greatest generals, Randall Tarly) can and will rally behind. And you can't tell me Olenna had no descendants left given the veritable litter of granddaughters surrounding her in s3 (the grandsons were probably off doing knightly things or whatever). The Reach had the most prolific bunch of Houses in the Seven Kingdoms. Add to that, the fact that Cersei has no lack of enemies, pretty much every other region would be persuaded to either join Olenna's ""rebellion"" as it were, or at the very least sit the damn thing out, because god knows they didn't want another Aerys on the throne, and Cersei actually did the thing they didn't even know Aerys was gonna do.

Also, Jaime would have killed her himself. Ya know, because Jaime is actually a character in this scenario and not a plot device puppet for Cersei to mess around with.

tldr literally everyone should be rebelling against Cersei, even with the presence of Gregor Clegaine. Presence of the Kingsguard didn't stop the smallfolk from taking their shot at the royal party in s2 after all, and this was an event still in living memory (less than five years ago even).

People who just say Dany went ""mad"" are completely missing the point of her character. Dany is just a textbook tyrannical dictator, surrounded by sycophants who believed blindly in the justness of her cause to the point where they could rationalize and ignore the savagery of her methods and the collateral death and devastation she left in her wake.

Sam's comment was key, when he asked Jon if he thought Dany would give up her throne for the sake of her people. The answer was, obviously, 'no.' Jon's heritage meant that his claim was superior to hers, so everything she sacrificed and endured was for nothing, all of the promises of Viserys and her advisors were a lie, and the adoration she had come to \*expect\* from those she ""liberated"" was denied to her by those who she had come to believe were primed to embrace her.

As she said to Jon: ""Let it be fear."" Burning King's Landing was meant to be an act so savage that nobody would dare to oppose her again.

Dany's decision to burn King's Landing isn't a fit of mania, but rather a conscious decision. Her storyline's been defined by a quest for agency, to be a powerful ruler in her own name and never be at another person's mercy again. She also wanted to prove that she wasn't her father's daughter and that she was another warmongering tyrant callous to the needs of the people. For most of her quest, these aspects didn't conflict.

But then they started to conflict, especially when she got to Westeros. The people were resistant, she had few diplomatic allies, and as the Second Field of Fire showed, using violence *works*. It came to a head when Jon refused to marry and rule alongside her, since it meant that she had no peaceful means of gaining the respect and support of the Westerosi lords (and thus agency). The peaceful surrender of King's Landing would've shifted the credit for her victory to Tyrion, Cersei would've escaped, and she'd be ruling over a city full of people who disdained her. She'd be viewed as a weak ruler, and she'd never be able to achieve agency as a monarch without putting some fear of God into the people. She was faced with a binary choice: agency as a ruler through violence, or peaceful victory at the cost of agency.

It was her trusted advisers that tempered that. By the end of the series the vast majority of those advisors were gone and she was in a land that didn’t want her. If you were to just look at the outline of the series it’s a legitimate, realistic and logical ending. It’s just the fact that the writing of the last few seasons was extremely poor and made what should’ve been a logical (if not unwanted) ending of the series seem like it came completely out of left field.","No, but the way it happened was some piss poor writing.

GRRM had nothing to do with THAT.  He doesn't even have a Night King personified who is leading the Army of the Dead.   All  that is D&D's story, so it was their right to choose.  Jon WAS obvious, but that would have been fine.  But Arya was the avatar for the Many Faced God of death.  The NIght KIng raised the dead and made them his slaves...so the MFG would want the NK dead.   With her very special skills and the--probably--magical Dagger that Bran himself had given her, Arya was the reasonable alternative to Jon.  And her story was always protecting and avenging Starks and bringing justice.  So actually, though she surprised many fans including me--she protected her baby brother and killed the enemy of a god she had actually served.  They were hinting at it all season long, especially in the promotional trailers, teasers, etc.","No, but what’s that got to do with anything? The post wasn’t “what would’ve made it ok?” The post was “what would’ve stopped it?” Competent writers or not, she was always going to burn King’s Landing because that was GRRM’s ending to the story.","Got it,

Bad writing = ending I didn't want","I don't know where a source for D&D saying that would be, but [GRRM did a 60 minutes interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjDentEr9c4) where he said the ending isn't going to be that different for the primary characters than it is in the books. And that the show is an extremely faithful adaptation compared to 97% of all book to tv/film adaptations.

What?,But she still woulda burned king's landing. The question was what would have stopped her from doing it. Better writing would just have delayed it.,This is exactly what I meant by my comment. I feel like these guys are missing the point deliberately.,"Correct, she was definitely meant to go mad. I doubt youll find anyone disputing that it wasnt Martins original vision, or that it shouldnt have happened. The problem is that it shouldnt have happened *in that way.* It made no sense in the context of her most recent actions, and we had next to no insight into her thinking.  
A few episodes earlier she had stated she didnt want to burn kings landing. Then later on she went on to only burn those who didn't take a knee to her. Thus far, those made sense, it was a logical progression. From there, making the giant leap from killing enemies to her going back on her own word and killing everyone (including civilians) came out of nowhere.  


The only way i see it working, given only the scenes that the directors gave us, is if they had her second dragon be killed after she stood down  with the bells at kings landing.   
If they had jaimie kill the dragon, and she thought it was the civies, it would have made it understandable at least","You quoted me giving examples of bad writing... I think you must've missed something. He said better writing would have prevented Danny from burning King's Landing. I said while there were problems with it's execution, Danny roasting KL was always going to happen. Better writing would not have changed that.","ehhhhhhhh. There's a difference between killing those she perceives as evil/her enemy and literally civilians, mothers and children, which she up until now had always explicitly saved.  Its not just a marginal thing, its a HUGE red line for Dany. She even jailed her dragons in previous seasons when they burned a single child......and now she is just burning kids willy nilly?   
We can get there, and i personally like the story of a tragic descent into madness, but with what we were given, there just wasn't enough pieces in place to make it feel natural. And It wasnt just her ""likability"", it was her words, her actions and her behavior in every episode until the last one.

And

Also note the emphasis on “I don’t think it’s going to be **that** different.” Imo this sounds like George still locked into a contract to not talk badly about the people still making him a great deal of money even though there’s a ton of evidence that he has disagreed with their vision at the very least in the past. 

At the end of the day though, we won’t know until the last two books come out, which is my point. Is George just playing nice for hbo execs who are worried people might not tune in to an inferior ending? Is he being “honest” in that their ending isn’t different from the ending he gave them, but that ending has changed in the past few years on the writing block? Or is he just telling the truth and Dany does the exact same thing in the books?

She wanted a free world where people were free to do what they want. Daenerys would go to any extent to acheive this.This behavior is pragmatic not cruel or mad. Dany was someone who used fear to rule from start itself.That doesnt make her a villain. Aside from that Dany wanted power and control like anyone else would. She also didn't want to be alone, she wanted a place in the world where she was loved and cherished for. Her characterization is more elaborate and sensible in books. I don't from where you get the idea she is more ruthless. Dany is smart enough to never burn King's Landing. She would never be her father","The subject matter isn’t the reason the ending was bad, the timetable was.","Oh yeah, you're right! My bad","In other people's defence you didn't even make a point. All you said is ""better writing"". Can't miss a point if you didn't make it.",I agree! If they had just waited to kill the other dragon once the bells were already ringing it would have made her immediate rage so much more impactful,"Right. I can still see how it *could* make sense. Jon being the true heir threatens her claim and she lost 2 of her greatest friends, one of which kept her fairly grounded and always tried to talk her out of committing violent acts, as well as the death of another dragon in the span of a week or so. The issue is that they crammed it all in 2 episodes, so when she attacked the city, it felt like such a sudden turn.

>If they had jaimie kill the dragon, and she thought it was the civies, it would have made it understandable at least

Make it Qyburn or Euron instead of Jaime (people may've hated the direction his arc took, but he didn't really do anything that ruined his growth. Openly siding against our heroes definitely would have ruined his character for sure) and I like this idea. She wouldn't even have to blame the civvies. Euron, being the crazy bastard that he is, ignores the surrender and shoots Raegal while their guard is down. This triggers her fit of rage and she destroys the Iron Fleet and then attacks the city.","Everyone saying she was meant to go mad, but no one explaining why she was. Oh because the coin flipped yadda yadda I want facts","No no, go to the book sub, there are plenty of people that don't think Dany will go mad. I'm pretty sure the most accepted theory is that she will accidentally destroy King's Landing by igniting the wild fire caches, then go North to fight the most certainly not already dead Others.",Dang who saved all of those slaves she knew nothing about to then Dany who lost her best friends and was paranoid her love was going to take her throat. Those sorts of feelings should of taken months if not years of tv to develop not 2 weeks of crying. Come on. It was the right ending but not the right route to get there.,"I think she gets singled out because of how terrible the writing was and how poorly she was portrayed. I agree most of the people vying for the throne all had an ends justify the means mentality, my point was dany had advisors to temper that, and by the end of the show those advisors are either gone or she’d lost faith in the ones that were left. I guess what my point really is, is that if you were to break the last two seasons down into bullet points of the key events there are logical points to drive dany down the mad queen road. The writing itself was just very poor and it made what should’ve been a fleshed out and logical descend into madness and tyranny unbelievable. So a believably tragic resolution to the story came across as hurried and hamfisted, ruining a lot of people’s favorite character in the process.",[removed],"Nah, they are right to. The question is what would have stopped her from burning Kings landing. Better writing would have made it feel more justified, but it wouldn't have stopped it from happening. I was off base ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",Not according to our Necrophyle guy,"There are always options other than *torturing children*. At that point, she's no better than the Masters. Same for when she threw a man to her dragons to eat while saying ""maybe you're innocent 🤷🏼‍♀️"". Both that action in the show and the torture of innocent children in the books were not her only option. It was the easier option.

And no other character would have so many people justifying them if they tortured innocent people to make their family members talk or throw a possibly innocent person to be eaten by animals (all while admitting these people are innocent/may be innocent).","I disagree, it was pretty trash writing aka subject matter.","Or, all that happens up to destroying the Iron Fleet. Then, she makes her way to the Red Keep.  We are certain she is going after Cersei for revenge. But, rather than burn Cersei, she lands the dragon and offers Cersei a ride. Cersei obliges. They go for a nice ride and Cersei smiles out of positive joy for the first time in many seasons. They bond, fall in love, and in a fit of jealousy, the King of the Norf mounts the dragon in the middle of the night and burns the whole fucking city down. If he can’t have her, nobody can!!! Expectations Mother Fucking Averted Mother Fuckers!!!!  

Curtains","Jaime was just the first name that popped in my head since i remember him wandering around the city with the civilians at the time, but true it could literally be anybody at that point.  
It would be way better, and then at least everyone could understand her motivations.","Its poetic. Over the course of the series she slowly takes more and more drastic actions. Based on GRRM plotting, it would be a perfect bow to wrap up her story arc, the irony of her burning down that which she sought her whole life.","Actually there are people who think DnD gave Dany JonCons storyline. He and FAegon will sack Kings Landing brutally when he hears tge Bells again...He is tormented by his loss at the Batlle of the Bells and has nothing to lose because he has Greyscale. BookDany will most likely face up against Euron who will steal one of her dragons and then against fAegon. However, the Forsaken chapter indicates that Euron will be King for a time too...I dont think anythibg that hapoened in tge show can predict what will happen in tge books. They are so different and there are ao many characters that got cut out or changed.","Right. It's also that season 8 was setup for the NK/AotD and Cersei/Lannisters as the big villains. One was dispatched with in an episode, and the other did nothing but antagonize Dany and complain about elephants (how utterly useless was the Golden Company?). So it's really a triple punch to the gut done that way. It's making me angry all over again as I type this.

Edit: If they had given each one of those three a season to focus on, then it could have been done proper justice. S8 - WW threat is dealt with. S9 Cersei, Lannisters, Euron and Golden Company (where they actually fight battles). And then S10 for Dany. 

Also, Dorne, The Faceless Men and Daario  are brought back into it. The amount of wasted opportunity here is staggering.","Tbf the books definitely won't have the same ending as the show. The same general plot points, yes, Danny's still gonna go crazy at some point. But the show had to fill in a lot of blanks as well thanks to Aegon not existing","The action in the show is irrelevant as it just murdered her character. The children were right in front of her and she didn't torture, she would be considered foolish and weak by Dothrakis. People who come to assassinate her expect to die,only way to stop them is through mental/physical torture. You want her not to save her and her son's life because of moral standards. What kind of person would do such a thing?
The foolish kind","But wait, Jon isn't romantically involved with his aunt anymore. The only way to patch this plothole is for Jorah to return from the dead and kill Jon, steal the dragon, and destroy the city.

We don't know how Jorah came back from the dead without a red priest or a Night King to revive him, and I'm pretty certain his body was burned, but he's the only one jealous enough to return for Dany's love","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/gameofthrones) if you have any questions or concerns.*","I don't understand the ""kill now apologize later"" point you're trying to make about her attacking Jaime's army. It's war and the Lannisters were the ones who started the attack on her by sacking High Garden, what does she have to apologize for? 

I also don't get what you mean by ""you have to earn the throne not just expect people to bend the knee cause they have to"". That's literally how conquest works. Aegon the conqueror was able to unite the 7 kingdoms because he had power like Dany and was able to intimidate people into bending the knee. How do you ""earn"" the throne properly in your opinion?

I also don't think it's fair to say she was portrayed as some ""warrior goddess saint"" after season 8 (lol). Even in season 7 they were portraying her completely reasonable decisions as being irrational. The way they framed the execution of the Tarlys with ominous music and Tyrion looking disappointed was insane. The Tarlys committed treason and she wasn't doing anything wrong by executing them, literally every ruler would have done the same and yet it's portrayed as bad because it's Dany and people hold a lot of double standards towards her because of who her father was. The only person in the series who was portrayed as a god/warrior/saint who can do no wrong imo was Jon Snow.",">So, she wants the Iron throne. Why? Well, because her father had it, and she's the rightful ruler. But, Westeros doesn't work like that. You have to earn the throne, you can't just expect people to bend the knee just because they have to. 

That would be a preferable situation, but I don't think it is an accurate description of Westeros. Westeros has worked exactly like that for hundreds of years. The Targaryens stole the throne (or thrones, as there were a bunch of kings at the time), but before that it was handed down through the Noble family lines of each Kingdom. They didn't have to earn their Kingdom, they inherited it. After The conquest the Kingdoms were combined into one Kingdom which was handed down from Targ to Targ. Robert's Rebellion then changed it to a Baratheon rule, but it was still a right of succession situation. 

It was entirely understandable that the heir to the previous dynasty would want to ""take back her throne"". As the last living Targaryen it makes perfect sense that she would want to re-conquer her lands, and that she would believe it should still belong to her, given the stories she heard about why it was taken.","This is what pissed me off most about season 8. Daenerys' character arc could have been one of the best in TV history. A slow burn where she gradually realises how short sighted she was, how few people are on her side, and how she slowly, over the episodes, goes crazy and turns exactly into her father.

But unfortunately they decided to do this swing (which could have been told across 10 episodes of an epic season) in 15 seconds of one scene. That, coupled with Emilia Clarke's one-dimensional acting, made it the biggest disappointment of the whole series","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

It’s just that her birthright be restored, especially after the treachery and brutality that took it away.

It’s just that someone pays for every ounce of pain that generations of slaves endured.

But she isn’t just about terrible and swift justice. She acknowledges that she always leans to going to far, and she usually tries to temper herself with her advisors. She’s constantly learning and adapting to new information, instead of being a rigid terrible leader.",When I put season 7 & 8 together it is easy to see why Daenerys went Crazy... she listened to Tyrion's advice and was screwed over time and again... Daenerys was almost killed by Tyrion's brother Jaime... Queen Cersie won't negocitate and is beyond evil. Jorah died Jon wouldn't kill Daenerys the support and strength she needed. Daenerys genetic DNA took over and she became who she always was,"If it was Ned instead of Dany fighting the Lannisters, we would have cheered when he executed the Tarlys. Double standards yo.","I'm saying that people bend the knee to cersei because they fear her, and they see her as maybe not just, but a feared, strong leader. If Joffrey had ruled the throne any longer, I'd debate that there would be some kind of uprising, same with Tommen. I'm saying that she can't take the throne and expect people to bend the knee. They may fear her, but she is from a completely different continent, and she's otherwise unheard of except for rumours, especially until around the 5th season. Just like Aegon, there would be assassination attempts. The Targaryens just don't have that some popularity and recognition as the other houses. lol I probably didn't explain it right. 

Btw, I'm up to the start of season 8, and I'm just sick of the whole 'dany is so good and she let john ride on the dragons and Jon's in love with her so he bent the knee, and it's going to be perfect if they both take the iron throne'

Honestly, I felt really uncomfortable during that mass execution-style dragon attack she did. Despite the victorious music and camera angles, and the fact that maybe they deserved it, it didn't feel right. You might say that if she sent the unsullied on them, they would have all died anyways, but I just feel like none of them had a chance. I'd prefer if she gave everyone a chance to bend the knee first or something, even if none of them would. The execution of the Tarly's was excusable, but still felt wrong, with Tyrion's face and all that. I mean, she told them to tell her if she'd gone to far before the fight. He did, and she ignored him. That isn't what a good ruler does.",No. Killing the Tarlys the way she did was wrong. You don't kill your prisoners and get to be called anything but ruthless and evil.,"Yeah, if she went way too far, and then over at least a season realises that she isn't as powerful as she thinks, has a giant character ark, it would have been absolutely amazing. Or at least turned evil over a couple of episodes.","I mean, yeah I agree 100%. I think had they shown her realizing what her actions have cost people and how they pushed others away from her ideals and how she couldn’t handle going at this alone, I would have enjoyed it more. But man GoT just really ran itself into the ground","I disagree with her DNA having anything to do with it, but everything you mentioned, + Missandei getting her head cut off + the rush of adrenline that you get in a siege, which was explicitly mentioned multiple times in the show, should be enough for people to understand why she is able to snap in the moment the way she did.","""character development doesn't matter but DNA does"" is an inherently nihilistic view. Why bother showing Dany in S1-S7 if her learning and making choices isn't important?","It’s a point a few commentators have made, the show runners use music to tell us who got what they deserved and who is a victim - take Tyrion at black water bay - he used a similarly destructive method to Dany in the Field of Fire 2.0 and going into season 7 he’s still proud enough to boast about the event that killed Davos’ son...with Davos being 10 steps away from him but what he did wasn’t a war crime apparently

Which taps into another issue of people trying to apply 21st century morality to a world that’s broadly analogous to the medieval era","This is a classic case of the audience feeling like she's doing something wrong even though she isn't because of framing. I get that it felt wrong because of Tyrion telling her not to do it but logically there's no reason Tyrion should be against this. This is medieval times, execution is very common. Tyrion being disgusted at her executing people who committed treason against her makes no sense. Tyrion being against war makes no sense. Tyrion thinking fire is too cruel to use in war makes no sense considering he literally used fire to blow up hundreds of thousands of soldiers in season 2. Also, I would argue some of Dany's biggest mistakes have been her listening to her advisors too much, she would have been better off if she took Kings Landing like she wanted at the start of season 7 instead of listening to Tyrion. Dany has a lot of faults, but listening to others isn't one of them. Here's a quote from her in the books:

 ""A queen must listen to all, the high born and the low, the strong and the weak, the noble and the venal. One voice may speak you false but in many there is always truth to be found.""

I'm still confused about your point about her not going about taking the throne the right way. There might have been assassination attempts against Aegon but doesn't ever king/queen experience this to some extent? And they didn't succeed so Aegon was ultimately successful, he built an empire that lasted centuries. The Targaryens are very well known as they were the ones who united the 7 kingdoms and ruled them for centuries but their popularity certainly dipped after the mad king (lol) so yeah people are wary of Dany but they also don't like Cersei (the current queen). Every ruler who has ever attempted to take the throne has done it through war and intimidation. Aegon, Robert Baratheon, Stannis, etc. all used these tactics so why is it wrong if Dany does it? What do you think would be a better alternative?",Death is the punishment for betraying your liegelord (Tarlys were sworn to House Tyrell). Oaths of loyalty are taken extremely seriously. Execution was the right choice to keep all other vassals in line.,"Lmao ok so then Ned executing the deserter was wrong, Jon executing Olly and Janks Slynt was wrong, anytime any ruler ever executed anyone in the series was wrong. If you're gonna call Dany ruthless and evil for executing prisoners even after giving them a chance to live then that applies to Ned, Jon, and others as well. The difference being that Ned or Jon didn't give their prisoners any alternatives.",And they were also sworn to house Targaryen since the tarlys fought for the mad King during RR,Did I say Ned wasn't wrong? And Olly and Slynt committed murder. That's wholly different.,"No but you implied Dany was evil because of that act of execution, do you also think Ned is evil? 

Olly and Slynt are also not wholly different. The Tarlys were sworn to house Tyrell who were also Dany's allies. They chose to betray the Tyrells and aided the Lannisters in wiping out the entire Tyrell line, which is also kind of murder and treason lol.","Well, it didn't take place in the 80s.","[NO SPOILERS] means any comments with spoilers need to use spoiler tags to cover the information.

That is the whole point of a trial by combat: it is to put the decision of guilt or innocence upon the gods rather than the king. If you are innocent, the gods will guide you (or your champion) to victory. By losing that fight, the gods themselves declared Tyrion to be guilty. That is why Tywin was so annoyed about Tyrion choosing a trial by combat - Tywin intended to spare Tyrion's life, but Tyrion took it out of his hands and placed his fate in the hands of the gods.

It doesn't matter who becomes King or what that particular monach feels about the ruling, they do not have the power to overrule the will of the gods.

There are only two ways Tyrion keeps his head:

1. Bran declares the seven to be false idols and outlaws their worship (something I am sure didn't happen because Bran wasn't immediately overthrown), or:

2. They just ""kinda forget"" that the trial even happened.","The Nights watch is home for many people, bastards, banished, homeless, or just those who believe its a cause worth joining.

I mean, thats the justification they give for it but thats just a way of rationalizing it to the smallfolk. 




> That is why Tywin was so annoyed about Tyrion choosing a trial by combat - Tywin intended to spare Tyrion's life, but Tyrion took it out of his hands and placed his fate in the hands of the gods.


I mean, Tyrion put his fate into the hands of the Viper who would have won the fight had he not be cocky.

I think youre overplaying the importance of the deities in this situation. 



>There are only two ways Tyrion keeps his head:



Eh, i mean Bran could probably easily figure out that Tyrion didnt do the crime so therefore he shouldnt have been on trial in the first place. Just because someone is convicted of a crime doesnt mean they actually did it.  I feel like it would also be easy for Bran to pardon Tyrion of the crime he didnt commit.","The Gods lmfao. Again, Bran chose not to carry out Tywin's order to kill Tyrion. Also, you ""kinda forgot"" that King Tommen outlawed the God's Trial by Combat which means Tyrion's trial was an illegal proceeding anyway and that King's hold more power than the 7.

There is so much more content in the books that just had to be pared down for television. At a minimum it drastically fleshes out things from the show that really needed it. Plus, the book series is written specifically to be reread, so you’ll catch a lot more of the small details that a reader would never catch on a blind read through. 

One important caveat is that the first season of the show was an incredibly accurate and thorough depiction of the first book. So if you do decide to read the series and find yourself thinking “what the hell, this isn’t different at all, what are people talking about?” that’s why. Each book diverges further and further from the show to the point where we’ll over 50% of the material from the final 2 books was cut from the show.

Book 1 is a little slow, but books 2-4 I couldn't put down. Book 5 was ok, but overall, all the books are a great read.","Absolutely! In addition to the fact that the show went off the rails when it went beyond what is published, a book series can accomplish so much that TV cannot. The books are written with each chapter being from the point of view of one of the main characters, so you really get a deeper sense of who they are and the way they think. A TV show doing someone's inner monologue would be super cheesy.

The books also go so much more in depth with the history of the world that makes much more sense than the show could ever portray. The show was kind of like the spark notes version of the world building.","Very much yes! I watched the series first as well, and it was interesting to see the differences between the two. Especially when you get to the later books, and see how the show deviated from the books.","Not only are the books better than the show, from what I remember of the books vs the show, the show seemed to veer way off course from how some of the plotlines in the books went.

So once he had a son, we wanted him to be named Aegon.","Because Jon in the show is Jon in the books + fAegon, since they didnt included fAgeon on the show they joined Jon with fAegon. In the books Jon is not going to be named Aegon, hes probably going to be Aemon or Jaehaerys","Most people argue because of prophecy (the dragon has three heads) that a son needed to be name Aegon, in the fashion of the Targaryen siblings that make up the sigil of House Targaryen. I never buy into this because what does naming a kid have to do with prophecy? The son can still be the Prince that was Promised even if his name is Bob Targaryen.

I think it's because Benioff and Weiss just wanted a strong Targaryen name that elicits a reaction in the viewers, many of whom are not well-versed in the history of the dragonlords. Aegon the Conqueror is just more well-recognized than if Jon's name was Jaehaerys or something like that.","My money is on ""they did so as to avoid creating confusions in the viewers"". Those of us who actually read the books are quite well-versed on the history but that's basically the reason why we don't see characters like Victarion, Arianne, Willas or Garlan and so forth (just to name a few of the major ones).

Putting too many characters in a span of a couple of hours of show is a daunting effort and since they completely cut off Aegon VI's story arc, the name was kind of free; also, everyone knows that Aegon was a Targaryen therefore the name sollicits an immediate response in that sense, whereas calling him Jaehaerys (as many believe his name will be in the books) would not have sent the same kind of message. Who, watching the show alone, knows about King Jaehaerys Targaryen or what he did? And who knows about King Aegon?","I think his actual (book) name would've been Jahaerys or even Jahaeron. That makes way more sense. I think Dan & Dave were just being dumb since George was gone by then and they didn't actually read the books. Also, why doesn't Danaerys, Jorah, or Varys (or anyone who knows Targaryen history) react to Jon being able to ride a dragon? Why is Euron an idiot? And more.... There's so much stuff they left out or obviously ignored/forgot that just doesn't make sense.",I dont think Rheagar's first son's name was ever mentioned on the show and the writers liked the name Aegon more than whatever Jon's real name was supposed to be,"**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

But I’m asking about the show.",">Because Jon in the show is Jon in the books + fAegon, since they didnt included fAgeon on the show they joined Jon with fAegon. 

I believe that this is the case. Since they didn't use Aegon/FAegon, they potentially took parts of his story (or meant to) for the show.

There is nothing in the show that justifies his name being Aegon. All of it is speculation and personal head canon.","Do we ever see Rhaegar giving a crap about the prophecy in the show? Also I could understand if we were never told in the show what Rhaegar’s other children’s names were, but we’ve heard it a bunch of times.","This is valid, but I still don’t get it. I’m watching with a couple other people and one of them said “Wait- isn’t there another kid named Aegon?”

I don’t think we are necessarily going to see Jon be given any Targaryen name. Maybe Bran will see a discussion about it, but I don’t think Lyanna and Ned has any time to discuss what Jon’s name should be and it’s not like Jon is going to stop being called Jon and take up this other name. After (f)Aegon and Dany I doubt anyone wants to deal with another Targaryen sounding name. 

I just find it so interesting that D&D decided to change Asha to Yara because viewers won’t be able to differentiate between Asha and Osha but somehow think Rhaegar naming 2 out of his 3 children the same exact thing makes any freakin sense at all.","I think it is probably a combination of the above, and a subtle acknowledgment, directed to book readers,  of the exclusion of FAegon and the fact Jon is getting a bit of his arc (apparently the bit that undermines Dany's self identity and sends her over the edge).","Jahaerys sounds just as Targaryen as anything else. Only only people in the show with -aerys names are Targaryens. Danaerys, Visaerys, and Aerys are the only others apart from Aemon. The moment you hear a Targaryen sounding name, you know. And she already says his last name.

It makes more sense that Jon is a shortening of his Targaryen name. I think his actual name is something like Jahaeron.","In the show as well, he wanted to replace his existing son with Jon and Aegon was the name he wanted for his heir. The books don't really stray from the books very much in that regard.",Book!Rhaegar actually thought his son with Elia: Aegon to be TPTWP. He may have simply pursued Lyanna for a third head to the dragon.,"It does kind of make sense:

1. He might’ve wanted to honor the son

2. Lyanna did","I think it was because maybe a) lyanna wanted to honor the dead baby or b) rhaegar did. Idk that’s my theory. 

Personally I feel like the aegon in the books is a pretender.","No, because Rhaegar's appearance in Daenerys' trip through the House of the Undying did not make the transition from book to show.

I think Thoros mentions their names to the Sandor, something along the lines of: ""House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne."" Also think Oberyn uses their names when speaking with Tyrion in early Season 4.","Uhhh, no? There's no indication Rhaegar wanted Jon to ""replace"" Aegon in the books. We do know from Dany's HOTU vision that Rhaegar thought Aegon was TPTWP but that there still needed to be the third head of the dragon. 

Jon's real name being Aegon is very likely a show invention.",Is that explained in the show though?,I agree. But this isn’t told in the show.,"Yeah, the kids names were mentioned quite a bit in the show. Maybe even more than Aegon the Conqueror. 

I just don’t understand how (in the show) it makes any sense. 

And obviously in the books I don’t think Jon is even going to have a different name, and certainly not Aegon since we already have (f)Aegon running around.

Edit: grammar",I just go with in the books his real name is something like jahaerys or aerys or lyagar but because they needed to combine the aegon targayean pretender plot and the r+l=j plot they just mashed it together,Not everything is explained perfectly in the show.  Just something you have to come to terms with.  You have to use your imagination to fill in the holes and in a lot of cases there are book explanations that you can choose to make canon in your head or not .,"Yeah, in the show he may as well have been looking to replace Elia and Aegon essentially.","Believe me, I ground my teeth more than Stannis Baratheon when I saw that scene the first time. It sounded so stupid that Lyanna would name her son the same as his half-brother, that I tried to come up with different rationalizations. Looking at the show in perspective, I think that Benioff and Weiss made lots of decisions based on what made the story easier for general audiences.","I mean, if Rhaegar was thinking of getting his third head of the dragon he would have thought Jon would turn out to be a girl, i think. Considering that his planned name for Jon was probably Visenya? Then, who knows what Lyanna actually ended up naming him while Rhaegar was away","The book has a plotline where instead of tyrion going to meet dany, he is sent to go meet a man who claims to be aegon targayean, rhaegars son who apparently got smuggled out of the city by Varys. He will go to Dany, marry her and then they’ll go conquer Westeros. The book does flip flop but never answers if the boy really is the son (I’m gonna say no considering the show) but that was the plot.","Yeah, it happened and I was kind of shocked. The R+L=J is good enough. Why screw it up calling him Aegon? Might as well name him Aemon since we have an actual person we know with that name. Instead of just stealing the name of a child that he already had.","I guess since Rhaenys and Aegon aren’t talked about that much it could make sense to general audience but after 6 seasons I feel like enough people watching the show are involved in it on a more complex level to know that Rhaegar already had a kid named Aegon, but maybe I’m giving too much credit. 

Imagine if Robert was just like “yes these are my children named Joffrey, Myrcella and Joffrey.”","I just went with it was to honor him. It’s a Scottish tradition that if you lose your child, you name your next baby after their dead sibling. Alexander Hamilton’s oldest son Phillip died in a duel and so their youngest son was named Philip or little Phil. Heck even in Austria, maria theresa had two daughters named Elisabeth and three named Maria Carolina: the first Elisabeth died as a toddler from a stomach virus and the oldest became a nun because she was supposed to have been married to the king of France while her sister to his grandson but her face got scarred from smallpox. Meanwhile the oldest maria Carolina died after about a year and then the next one died the day it was born after an emergency baptism. The youngest was a badass Italian queen and close to Marie Antoinette.",I always went with the theory. The dragon has three heads and aegon the conqueror married his eldest because it was tradition and his youngest out of love.,"In the books it’s even more complicated because walder Frey has dozens of grandkids named walder or walda to honor him and curry favors, even if he hates it: there’s black walder, fair walda, fat walda, walder rivers, etc. The show has his son Waldron but that son was named elmar and he actually met his betrothed. He didn’t know who she was so he spent the whole time bossing her around and yelling at her and when he got upset that his father said he might either have to find a new bride or become a septon she’s like “f u!”

GRRM said that he does stuff like that because it’s stupid that there’s only one guy named Robert on the whole continent even though he’s the freaking king. Robb Stark, sweetrobin and Barra are just some of the kids named after him. Granted he’s never done having four kids of one lord be named the same though.",Yeah but Walder Frey is a complete nut and everyone knows it.,"Good point. There is a rhaegar Frey in the books though. >!Davos is sent to try and curry favor with the manderly family for stannis. Lord manderly’s son is a hostage of the Frey family and the three Frey’s sent (rhaegar Frey included) betroth his two granddaughters to rhaegar and little walder. Rhaegar is implied to be a physically abusive husband. When lord manderly is able to get his son’s release, he secretly kills them and bakes them into pies he presents at ramsay’s wedding.!<",That is the single most disturbing scene in the entire series.

Not saying it's not a great show. Personal taste is purely what I'm conveying, I read some of the books and watched some of the first season and the general plotline and story is great.

HBO did not officially state ""We aren't doing this because it's 'too woke'.""

An unidentified (and presumably disgruntled) source described that as the reason in a sarcastic and derisive description of a policy decision they didn't agree with.","I think it is more of the fact that the first white Walker was black and other efforts to force racial/sexual diversity.

And for good fucking reason. These “woke” pandering movies/tv series fail hard. See ghostbusters/oceans8. 

The push on racial/sexual diversity is so frustrating because you get pandering rather than organic development of characters. Like we had Renly who was gay as well as Margaerys brother (whatever the fuck his name was). It’s not like thrones shied away from these topics but they also didn’t use them for some pandering agenda like we see in media so often now-a-day’s.","Pandering for the sake of pandering and ""forced diversity"" usually do fall flat, because it typically feels so inauthentic and transparently agenda driven. I think it's one of those ""When it's good it's good when it's bad it's bad"" type things. 

So I have to agree that if that was what the script  looked like I'm glad they passed on it rather than get a really subpar spin off.

**Daenerys Targaryen will be Resurrected!!! 🐉🐉🐉**

OK, so my reasons for this to happen:

**1.) HBO (the company behind the show) will NOT let ""Game Of Thrones"" die. It just prints too much money for them, literally hundreds of millions of dollars... $$$ $$$ $$$** 💰💰💰 Look at Star Wars & Disney for example. The original episodes were created many-many years ago, but the franchise keeps releasing new movies almost every year now. They have literally no reason so stop, until they get guaranteed profit from it.

**2.) Characters get resurrected all the time in Game Of Thrones. Jon Snow, Beric Dondarrion, Faceless God assassins, White Walkers...** So the fantasy world allows resurrecting dead people.

**3.) The Dragon flew aways with the body of Daenerys. It would make no sense to stop here.** There should be a reason for this to happen. If something significant happens in a movie, usually there is a good reason for it.

**4.) Another related story element, that will happen according to my humble opinion: BRAN will turn out Evil. And Daenerys will be the one who wants to stop him.** This is just a guess; George R. R. Martin likes to shock the readers / TV serial fans, so we can expect a lot of unexpected things to happen, and this is one of them. Instead of a Peaceful End (dead Dragon Queen after the massacre, all-knowing peaceful guy on the Iron Throne) we will get an even bigger WAR than before.

Here is a nice article about the resurrection topic too: [https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-daenerys-dead-resurrected-red-priestess/](https://screenrant.com/game-thrones-daenerys-dead-resurrected-red-priestess/)

On the flip side, certain areas (mostly taken from the book) are handled well: Margaery Tyrell’s very feminine and extremely underrated manipulation of the game, and Varys’ sexuality (or lack thereof) and its implications on his morality, skill in playing the game, etc., even Jon Snow’s sexuality is telling of his underlying character - he only loves/is attracted to people he genuinely respects (Ned Stark’s honour comes right out). There’s loads to be examined, and it’s quite trendy in academia at the moment (both GoT and gender and sexuality studies).

Also, Elia and her children were kept at the Red Keep by Aerys, sort of as hostages to ensure Dorne's support. Prince Lewyn Martell was also one of Aerys' Kingsguard, so he was a natural fit to lead the Dornish forces at the Trident. 

Perhaps if Dorne had known about the annulment they would have tried to extract Elia and her children from King's Landing before any decision on what side of the Rebellion they would be on.","Honestly, the Targaryens had the upper hand in pretty much every conflict in history.  I guess the Dorne decided it would be safer to side with the most powerful dynasty ever.  That or they were just terrified of what the Mad King would do to them if they didn't come to help the Targaryens","They did it because not only were they allied with the Targaryens through Elia's marriage to Rhaegar but Aerys also held Elia and her children hostage and he would have surely not treated them gently if House Martell refused to help them out against Robert. 

Doran also presumably wanted his nephew to be king eventually, i think all of this overrode him being mad at Rhaegar for doing what he did with Lyanna(and Doran definitely was mad according to George himself).","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

Real life is different and your implications are reductive. 

From a literary perspective I appreciate more the development between Dany and Drogo and how this changed them on an individual basis too. Dany becoming stronger and Drogo becoming more emotionally aware, etc.

Wish more people were aware of the ""freeze/fawn"" reactions to trauma, which is exactly what we see play out between Dany and Drogo. She can't fight back or run away, and the only people close to her at that point were also actively abusing her (Viserys) or were complicit/enablers (Illyrio) *and* biding their time until they get a ""turn"" (Jorah).

But do remember this is not like Mountain raping Elia Martell. 

Drogo's entire culture is of pillaging and raping. He doesn't know raping is even bad as that's how his upbringing was.

To him Dany was something to be used for sex.

Do remember however that Dany made him care for her however and he's ready to do things no dothraki ever dared to do for her.

He even fights a fellow khal in her honor. That's significant for a Dothraki to whom woman are hardly above objects.

I'm not condoning rape in any form. But I'm pretty confident by the middle of 1st season Drogo would never do anything to hurt his Moon of life.

This is not a case of a cruel man inflicting his perverse desires on a woman. This is a man who didn't know any better because it was unheard of in his upbringing.","Does it really make sense to compare a show about a fictional medieval universe to our modern day standards of behavior and justice? It's a story. Dany never got raped by anyone. Your outrage is for a make believe character.

But the Dothraki are literal barbarians. You didn't expect them to have some kind of progressive women's rights policy, did you? Dothraki, a terrifying, unbeatable army, unless a young girl tells them ""No."" 

Or is it that you're saying she shouldn't have been allowed to start to have genuine feelings for Drogo?

As far as it being different from the House of the Undying visions... we don't know if those were actual visions or illusions.  Was it the undying showing Dany visions? or just them creating illusions to trap her? We don't know.","The fact that rape exists in the narrative is not the issue. It’s extremely important that rape victims are represented realistically in media, which frankly the books did a decent job of. It’s not glossed over by the narrative, the assaults are important events in characters lives that have proportional consequences, and it is acknowledged explicitly that it is wrong. That is good writing! And not what this is about.

The reaction you are seeing here is to the real, non-fictional people excusing and romanticizing child rape. And if I avoided everything that reminded me of the events that caused my C-PTSD I’d never be able to leave the house or read a book or watch films. That’s no way to live! We shouldn’t have to leave the fandom just because people can’t grasp that it’s not ok to fuck kids, even if they’re fictional and played by hot people on TV.",We’re not necessarily complaining about the show’s representation of Daenerys and Drogo’s relationship! I think it’s more about the strange romanticization of the relationship by some of the viewers like OP and you and so many others in this thread,Man you’re not even worth arguing with,"Yeah and the ""wife"" and ""daughters"" of the psycho with the hidden tent city in his back yard loved him and were well adjusted, too...","He was quoting a line from Star Wars.

You dun got meme'd.","No one is criticizing the characters, plot, or GRRM. We’re criticizing real actual people who can look at a painting of a 14 year old and the man who bought, raped, and impregnated her and say “awww, how romantic!” and “it’s normal because [insert debunked myths about medieval Europe]” and “he was gentle the first time so it wasn’t rape.”",">Or is it that you're saying she shouldn't have been allowed to start to have genuine feelings for Drogo?

Nah, it is what it is in the story. That's fine.

People have a right to be disturbed by others thinking the relationship was super romantic though. People that say the show ""butchered their relationship"" because Drogo was more rapey on their wedding night is what I find strange.","It was never the norm for real life. Marrying young was the province of upper classes and royals who were in no way expected to procreate at 13. The ""30 yr average life span"" myth people like to bandy about to this day was accounting for high rates of infant mortality and illness, people who managed to survive to adulthood had a life expectancy much closer to our ""normal"" than 30. This is bunk, please just, idk, spend five minutes on google or read a book and reconsider your life choices that lead to you defending stuff like this.",Ok,Did you mean to reply to me? I'm saying even in the book she was raped.,"What does that have to do with whether Daenerys loved drogo or not? No one is defending rape or saying the Dothraki are progressive.

We’re saying Daenerys has a right to choose whether she loves drogo or not, and according to canon, she did. That’s all.","No really, thank you so much. I was completely wrong in how I went about this. You explaining to be how much of a fool I am has brought me to the light. Without your guidance I would have never understood. Thank you dear and kind friend.","I ain’t gonna comment on anything you said besides Dany only loving Drogo to survive. That’s just entirely untrue. You asked if this guy had read the books, implying that you have, then go off and directly contradict the content within the books, in which it is explicitly stated that Dany truly did love Drogo.","Wait I didn't know this was r/asoiaf 

I was talking about the show since free folk usually talk about the issues with the fucking show

And I'm not celebrating anything. Show Dany didn't use a survival mechanism. She genuinely cared.","Jesus dude, you know this is all made up shit right? Like fictional characters not someone’s real life.. taking it a liiiiittle seriously","No, she is not raped on her wedding night in the books. Drogo explicitly waits for her consent. 

Of course what he does later on in their marriage would be considered rape now, but its not in the context of that society. It's not meant to be offensive, it's meant to be historically accurate. 

In literary and historical analysis, presentism is the anachronistic  introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past. Presentism is considered a form of cultural bias, and creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter. The practice of presentism is regarded as a common fallacy in historical writing.",I thought she was submitting to him that night but did get raped later on... going to have to re read now,"If they're fictional, it's OK to do anything you want to them, though. Because they're fictional. They're literally not real. No one is advocating selling 13-year-olds to barbarians in real life and holding those up as model relationships. 

But you know what a lot of people have? Rape fantasies. Some studies I've seen show that it's the No. 1 most common fantasy for women to have, with something like 25-40% of women having such fantasies more than once a month. 

And GOT is fantasy. People are allowed to enjoy their fictional fantasies without being chased out of the fandom by people who can't separate reality from fiction.","It is strange, I'll give you that. But there's also like, weird as fuck stories and art out there about sex with cannibals and aliens and bestiality and shit. (Sometimes, literal, actual shit.)  

People are weird. They're real fucking weird sometimes. But when it comes to FANTASY, to fiction, to literal make-believe, they get to have and express whatever fucked-up fantasies they want.","don’t waste your breath on him, he’s just gonna continue thinking he’s “unpopular but right” when really talking to him is like talking to a wall. and people like him just write off anyone who disagrees with them as a virtue signaler instead of having an articulate conversation that actually goes somewhere.","You asked me a straightforward question. 

Shouldn’t the onus be on the media to realistically address rape and be more careful about how they represent victims?

And my answer to that is no. There's no onus. No one's rights are being violated by the creation of media you find distasteful. 

If you want me to change my mind, then show me how rape survivors rights are being violated.","I get what you're saying dude, but applying modern day social concepts to a medieval world is always going to leave many characters seeming somewhat vile.",I’ve never seen it,"Yes. You said he didn’t rape her the first time, but it’s still rape. She was sold to him and had no way to refuse or escape or stop it.","The comment I replied to implied that because she tried to revive him, that means it was done purely out of love, and anyone who thinks otherwise did not watch the show. I have read all of the books and seen all of the show, and am countering the argument with the fact that Dany *does* know what happens to a widowed khaleesi and therefore is acting out of self-preservation, as she has had to do for her entire childhood. A character can have more than one motivation. Dany's story is all about endurance, adaptation, and survival. She knows that if he is truly dead she loses his protection. 

That doesn't mean that as Drogo's victim she cannot love him; she obviously believes she does. But real, genuine love cannot exist in that environment. That's just a fact. She is a child, she is considered his property, and dependence is not the same as love. And as to your assertion that ""no one is defending rape,"" unfortunately people have been defending rape all over this thread. Some of the more vile comments have been deleted, but plenty of others remain. It's a shame but victims shouldn't have to leave or stay silent just to make others comfortable.","Once again, no problem :)","I didn't know Book Dany cared.

Thanks for the clarification","yeah also one thing to add on what you just said, **it isn't pedophilia it's more like ephebophilia and or hebephilia but it's not like the dothraki care about what age a teen is.**","Thanks for not reading anything I wrote, that’s cool I guess. And thanks soooo much for explaining to me, a female rape victim, how common rape fantasies are, that is brand new information and totally appropriate to the subject at hand. Jesus.",Can I get a link on that 25-40% stat?,"The thing virtue signalers love to do is they always accuse others of the things they do themselves. You simultaneously in the same comment accuse me of 'writing people off who disagree with them' and say 'don't waste your breath', which is writing me off because you disagree with me. You're completely incapable of self-reflection.","I think we just fundamentally disagree.  Ideally, I think the media should be careful about how they address sensitive topics. It’s the same reason people shat on 13 Reasons Why because it was reckless in how it handled bullying and teen suicide. Again though, that’s not my main concern. Game of Thrones’ portrayal of Dany and Drogo’s relationship wasn’t that bad all things considered. BUT I definitely think it’s weird that people like you romanticize it and somehow don’t get how that’s problematic. 

Also I don’t think I ever said that rape survivor’s rights are being violated. Again, I just said that we can try to be a little bit more cognizant of how posts like OP’s come off.",He's comparing you to an emotional villain lashing out in anger at everyone around you.,Someone who understands consent,"Maybe we should just agree to disagree but my point is that it is most definitely not “just a fact” that love cant exist in that environment.

Haha,It clearly is appropriate to the subject matter at hand because it's a related topic. It's literal fantasy. You can't get mad at someone for liking fantasy. It's THEIR fantasy.,that’s hilarious,So be it,"This thread is bringing out some real charmers, lol. I feel so bad for all the survivors in these people’s lives who have to listen to them spout this kind of apologist bs. They can lie about shit they don’t understand day in and day out, but the second a victim dares say “rape isn’t romantic” all hell breaks loose. Zero reading comprehension or compassion.","Well, no, we really should not ""agree to disagree"" because one of us know what they're talking about and the other actually thought ""I'm sorry you were raped BUT--"" was  okay and normal to say to someone. It isn't. Agreeing to disagree implies tolerance, and I won't tolerate falsehoods being spread about rape, full stop. Daenerys never had a ""right to choose"" (your words) because it. was. rape.

> GoT in two sentences.

So a lot of fans of GoT were disappointed with the last two seasons of GoT and felt that's where the show quality really went downhill. Obviously what you said can be taken at face value. But I thought you were also referring to the aforementioned idea of ""it was good except for the last two seasons."" 

Then there are fans like me who think the show took a deep and noticeable dive around mid-late season 4 or early season 5, not season 7 or 8 when the mainstream uproar was going on. It's sort of like how people started complaining about BBC Sherlock's poor last season, but some fans of Sherlock Holmes were pointing out the underlying writing issues from the first episode (flash vs substance- and completely missing the point of certain characters like Adler). So, assuming you were using the seasons=sentences vague idea, I said it might be better to say 3.5 or 4 instead of 2 sentences. It's a badly written, vague attempt at a joke, so don't worry about it.",Your friend got the eyebrows right. All that matters,Oh.

Tully and Arryn were not contenders. The Tullys were allied with the Starks and the Arryn's stayed out of it for most of the story and then also joined the Starks.

Writing-wise, it's the last time the show managed to surprise me in a positive way. Cersei blowing up the sept, the sudden deaths of so many characters, the reveal of Jon's parentage, Dany setting sail...the pinnacle was the dual coronation scenes. The acting from Sansa and Littlefinger during their glances at each other was chilling, and then the look exchanged between Cersei and Jaime, where Jaime seems to be abhorred at his sister...perfection.

Ramsey became a bit one not during his time but Yara's failed rescue attempt was a great subversion. Much of this episode is about dealing with the sins of family. This is seen in Tyrion, Dany and Yara's storyline's as they are all punished for the actions of their family (Tyrion's sham trial, Dany dealing with her dragons, and Yara seeing Reek).","Definitely Winds of Winter, one of the best TV episodes I ever saw.  So much closure, so many surprises, and Light of the Seven!   But on a more ordinary level, 4.10, The Children.  It was perfect--the theme of Children reverberated for **every** main character.  It ended with  Tyrion killing Tywin and leaving for Essos.  And finally Arya leaving the Hound to live or die and leaving for Essos, and with glorious music.  Even D&D were children--it was the finale of the last season primarily based on George's books.   They were on their own, for better or worse.","3x05 Kissed By Fire

So many great moments. Jamie & Brienne bath scene, The Hound & Beric trial by combat, Robb kills Karstark, Jon & Ygritte in the cave.","S1E6 A Golden Crown was content perfection for me.

Glad we have this pointless tag as well,In the show he says he couldn't,"No, She would be annihilated. While arya's faceless man skills makes her one of 2 most dangerous persons in westeros ( alongside with bran ) she cant be put on the same level as the bests swordfighters in westeros, she literally uses a needle as a sword, if she fights someone in armor what is needle going to do to them? Her sword and strength cant match jaime's, she would be instantly disarmed the moment their swords touch. Arya is no match for the likes of jaime, brienne, the hound and even jon.","I said he was one of the best, not the best. There's no doubt ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning would beat everybody.","What even makes you think like that? Because she knows that you have to stick them with the pointy end or because she had like half year training with stick? Or because she know a killer whe she sees one? 

What that does even mean that she would know how to prepare to fight Jaime? You prepare by training every day for all of your life and that can be not enough in most cases. 

Parrying is an essential skill in swordfighting.  You cant do that you die quickly, because you know swords are sharp. Dodging only wouldnt be enough since he would have greater range so Arya would be able to close the distance to ever make a cut.

Arya's fight IQ is unmatched..... wtf you mean by that? She can adapt to the opponent? If so that's also pretty essential skill and I'm sure Jaime was one of the best in that too.

>She’s very patient and would wait for Jamie to make the slightest error and capitalize,

Like noone ever tried that sneaky tactic before. 

We are talking about a guy who might match ser Arthur Dayne the Sword of the Morning for fucks sake, a guy who was knighted at the age of fifteen.

It was glorious but only once.,Sorry trolling. I dislike the tag,"It was a training lol, poor Arya if Brienne fought her like She fought the hound. The fight is unrealistic as fuck, in that fight Arya is able to parry Brienne swords, which if it was a real fight She couldnt. And i dont know why you said Arya won when they both ended with steel at their throats","I just hate how the show made her ""badass"". They took it so far that she could match Brienne, fight wights and kill NK. Because of that people think ""is she so badass that she would be able to beat this guy or kill that one? Pff she wouldnt even sweat, that's how badass she is"". This and her ""badass"" lines from last seasons made me hate her ""character"".

You still can write your arguments if you will... 

If we had applied her super thick plot armor she might have been able, but it would make much sense. Also she isn't a sword fighter, shes become an assassin. They don't fight 1v1, they try to kill from the shadows, not with sword in hand.","Only once?? She used it against that girl, the freys, and to assassinate the night king.   It wasn't just about skinning faces and wearing them.  She learned about sneaking around without seeing, how to be unseen, and more from that dude.",Ahh Forsure!,I completely forgot Brie had a sword to Arya. I thought it was just Arya to Brie. You sure?,But thank you for coming with facts and evidence it makes for an engaging conversation! Instead of just saying “jamie”,"I can stand behind that, I don’t like that she was the one to kill the night king. I thought it was very forced and lazy. 

              That is a good point for j vs a, my main basis for her sword skill stem from a few places but a big one was the spar with brienne. I think the only thing that supports she could do that was boiled down to her training with swords beginning at such an early age and the starks ability to hire the best they could because of their wealth. The other main part was her training with the “no name people” (I can’t remember their name). But I do agree with you to a point they did make her more “badass” than I liked","Oh yea I worded that very poorly, I was more talking the face swapping.

Visuals were great, storyline was pretty good if you like action movies that don’t make you think too hard.",The human parts were pretty boring and weird but it had good monster on monster mayhem.,I’ll go against the grain here and say it’s no good. Most of the movie is spent on boring humans either spelling out what the monsters are doing or being stuck in some crappy family drama.

Wolves, bears, squid, whales, mammoths, etc. The dragons were the Apex predators of the world, iirc. at first I was thinking how they’d take a biological approach to something this big, every time he took flight or used fire, the calories that would require would be insane...I wonder if part of the politics will be lesser houses and rural areas paying tribute to the dragon lords with constant livestock or fish... maybe even slaves. But at a certain point, we’re gonna have to chalk some of it up to good ole magic.

There’s also the fact that there’s a lot of fauna they haven’t addressed, whose to say the boars,aurochs, elk, etc in Westeros or Valyria werent massive, multi-ton beasts at the time?

Snakes can do that because they aren't flying around and breathing fire between meals.","Ferocious appearances aside, dragons of this size are kind of like baleen whales, cruising through the skies with their mouths partially open and skimming up entire flocks of birds.","Balerion probably didn’t eat any mammoths seeing as Aegon never took him that far north.

But a lot of people I think would agree that the dragons overshadow everything and was a huge disappointment to not see more of them being what we all thought they would be.","I think she was 13. Balerion was very old by this time and dragons are temperamental at best. Upon rebelling and secretly claiming Balerion, Aerea and B suddenly disappeared for a time, and when they finally returned to the Red Keep, she slid off his back and collapsed. It's unknown exactly what happened. But the consensus is that the ageing Balerion probably disregarded any commands young Aerea may have given him and took the opportunity to fly back to his birthplace, Valyria. Princess Aerea died very soon after returning, perhaps having been infested with fire wyrms. The maesters could do nothing, and were traumatised by what they saw on her deathbed. Balerion too was injured upon their return.

And I’d do it again too.","+1 for ""Poopsmith"".",I imagine they take the poop and burn it for heating homes and such. The poopsmith is an honorable trade,See thats the scary part to me. What if that was GRRM’s ending and they just rushed it? Rushed it just to get kicked off star wars ill add,"Lemme just hit that 1km snipe from a moving ship while aiming at a target flying up in the sky, which is probably the fastest thing on the entirety of planetos. Oh, and just an aside, no one has seen one of these things in centuries nor has anyone had the ability to practice shooting it, because again it’s in the air and fast as all shit.

Lemme just hit it three times no biggie.

And that’s not even mentioning Eurons excellent usage of dark magic jump-drives to appear out of thin air for the entire ordeal.","Dobt forget there are other magic creatures out there.  Krackens, dire wolves, giants, grumpkins, etc.  Could be a massive brontosaurus type creature they haven't discussed too.","Applying real-life biology to fantasy creatures only gets you so far, but for whatever it is worth reptiles need a LOT less food to function than mammals do.  Mammals have to constantly use energy to keep their temperature so much higher than their surroundings, while reptiles can just hang out in the sun.  Pythons can go months without eating.","Going by this picture and the size of that horse vs the dragon it would be like a human trying to survive on raisins.  The dragon would have to be constantly eating..like nonstop. Also they can only eat charred food so imagine Valerion trying to sift through a humongous field of ash to find the horse it meant to eat. At one point it became so big that humans, horses,  aurochs, etc were just too tiny to even bother.  It had to eat mammoths (then again like 5 or more each time?) or kraken and whales.","Do the books ever talk about the practicality of piloting a dragon? It can't be as simple as just hopping on and not falling off when the dragon is flying at full speed. GOT is so good because of how it presents fantasy in a realistic way, but Dany just getting on a dragon without even a saddle kind of bugs me.",Maybe he can eat trees and flora as well. Would make a lot of sense if that was the case. Lots of lizards survive off of greenery in the wild.,"Also, they are magical. You can use that to explain their size without creating the actual intake something like that would need.",Maybe the dragons could run off of oil? There are plenty of theoretically usable calories in it. Would be the medieval equivalent of a heavy bomber.,How WHAT play out??

Lol love the irony,Can we just press rewind back to the end of season 6 maybe and give them a couple of years to take it from there?,"It's not their lack of appearance that was annoying it was that they couldn't manage consistent sizing on a wolf through multiple episodes. Something that is bigger than real life but they can easily scale up.

I have no idea how they'll manage with dragons. It's going to scale to size as necessary for the plot. It'll be inconsistent and frustrating","All good, I just couldn't resist","and very briefly, Princess Aerea when she stole her and rode off to Valyira.","I heard that this prequel is taking place during the Dance, so maybe Rhaenyra?",[removed],"No matter the color when you, your pants and your shit are burned to the ground lol",It’s from a joke that the Lysene pirate tells in the show,Wrong sub :(,No graduates of the Prometheus School of Running Away From Things allowed.,"Zig zag like Shaggy Dogs’ master should have?

I originally had the far more boring ""sanitation worker"" but then I remembered [this guy](https://homestarrunner.fandom.com/wiki/The_Poopsmith) from back in the day, which is clearly the far superior (and more accurate) title.","What of they rushed it, because GRRM wanted to see how people reacted, so now he can change it to be better?",I thought he said that the ending was the same as the books but the paths to the ending was adjusted in the show. It doesn’t matter anyway. He’s never going to finish the books. It’ll be a miracle if we get Winds of Winter let alone the last one in the series.,"Haha, yeah, the wolves and squid comments were supposed to be representative of the more fantastical representation they have in Westeros :P 

And there’s the possibility of smaller Wyverns existing and being heavily predated on by the larger dragons?",The Krakens are probably the only creatures in the series that could give a dragon flying too low to the water some grief,"A Bronn-tosaurus? New theory, Bronn is the last of an ancient house that used to be caretakers of the brontosauruses. When they went extinct, the house lost its fortune and noble standing.",Maybe we can finally see a Grumpkin!,"Dire wolves, mammoth, are extinct animals from our world, although they made the dire wolves way bigger than in real life, I don't think it count as a magic creature.","Centaurs are another fantasy creature that I just hate. Looks cool AF, super impractical.","But dragons are fire, made flesh - not reptiles. I'm gonna go with magic. Lol.","As cool as reptiles are, for some reason I find dragons to be more bird like, I’m sure they’d have hollow bones, air bladders to help with flight mechanics, plus the intelligence they typically display, but there’s many sea birds that don’t eat for months, surviving on stores and drifting on oceanic wind currents for months.

Either way, we’re talking about mythological super creatures, all rules of our biology are probably suspended lmao",Their size is also more dependent on resources than mammals. I imagine they put quite a bit of effort into feeding a dragon considering one dragon can mean security for the kingdom,"The books don't get that far.  Dany is the only one that rides a dragon, and she certainly wasn't in control of it when she did.

However, a lot of readers speculate that Tyrion is going to create saddles for the dragons.  This was set up by him creating a special saddle for Bran that would allow him to ride horses even while paralyzed, and by Tyrion having an academic specialty in dragons, reading everything he can get his hands on about them.",">	GOT is so good because of how it presents fantasy in a realistic way

GOT pays little attention to the realities of physics, it cares about the realities of politics","My head cannon is that having targaryen blood allows you to have a mental link with the dragon. Sorta like the flyers in the movie avatar. Not necessarily ""driving"". But directing.","Yes, in Fire and Blood there is extensive talk about dragon saddles and how they chained themselves in as well as the use of whips for controlling the dragon in flight.",In other dragon lore dragons eat ash... so if it burns. Its food. Thats a great plot device.,"That could work, Eating minerals or oil could be a great way of explaining why the fire doesn’t require caloric fuel!","Prequels, actually :)",I am very excite,It's messed up...shows how little they cared about the show that literally gave their names any weight in the industry.,David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. They're only referred to because of their roles for the TV series.,"I agree with you. What they did with the direwolves was unacceptable and pretty much ridiculous. And I don't even understand why it went out that way. As you said, it's understandable that they downscaled them to fit on screen and for interpretation facilities, but one episode they were as tall as a person and the next one they were even smaller than a goddamn german shephard. That makes no fucking sense.

And as much as I don't want to focus on the worst, I'm afraid the same is going to happen with the dragons. And furthermore, I'm afraid they are aiming for a megaproduction that they won't be able to sustain throughout the entire show.","You’re saying you wouldn’t bust a huge nut at the sight of a gargantuan, kingdom destroying dragon? Imagine the girth of it alone, in awe at the size of that lad.","Ahhh dang, wasn’t sure if he’d make a sudden appearance here in our hour of need",I wish I could find the Bobby B bot on other subs.

Definitely not long enough to surpass Balerion but it'd be a start.","Rule of thumb: if you ever find yourself wondering if there’s a deeper logic to why D&D did what they did, just stop yourself then and there, because you’ve already strayed too far.",He's on record saying he wanted like 11 or 12 seasons of got,iirc there is a secrion in the world of ice and fire book that discusses wyverns in essos,There are supposedly ice dragons as well up in the northern seas that are wayyyyyyy big.,"When the Black Dread returned from Valyria he had a wound of pretty frightening proportions considering how OP Balerion was. 

I believe that fire-wyrms can grow to immense sizes too and that one of them took a bite out of Balerion. 

That part is pure supposition but there’s definitely *something* in Valyria that could hurt him and would probably kill a less-monstrous dragon,",Holy shit are krakens mentioned in the book?,There are also Leviathans in the waters around Westeros,"As a half-centaur, I take offense to that.",They're also obviously warm blooded,Birds are reptiles,In fire and blood it’s discussed that the Targs used saddles and whips,I thought that was actual canon.

There will be something to replace Game of Thrones’ popularity (if Stranger Things were a more expansive story with regular seasons then it could have already been that given how big of a cultural impact it had just off of its first season). 

Still, we’re measuring the series that generate the most chatter - certainly nothing will ever come close again to the viewership numbers of properties like M*A*S*H (much like theatres will never again sell as many tickets again as they did with Gone with the Wind)

**appears Reddit doesn’t like the MASH title formatting:-(","Never read The Witcher or played the games, will give the show a try but to be honest I’m not expecting much.","Hopefully not. I'd like it to be popular but no matter how much shit D&D got for their moms and NFL players comment they're absolutely correct that taking out a lot of the fantasy elements (and a lot of the dialogue) made the show much more popular with people. It's the same with the comic movies and what not too, you have to strip out a lot of the elements that make it fit a certain genre and make it more general action oriented to appeal to wider audiences. As such the one way I see the Witcher getting super big is if they do go through and strip a lot of stuff out.","
The Withcher will be just another lame show. Even the books arent that good. Very superficial characters. Super powers and magic everywhere. Monsters aĺ over the place. It's bad writing. It made for a great video game but the source material is bad. It's just for a small audience for people who are into all that. 

What made GoT interesting was that the characters were very well written and the world was very well realized. It was GRRMs story and plot.  It seemed like a real world. It was about humans, not magic and monsters. In the first 4 seasons that is. However after the first four seasons, garbage TV writers took over and turned it into a typical fantasy realm where everyone was either good or bad. Characters became super heroes. Timing and plot were all over the place and nothing anyone said or did made sense. It was a mess like every other fantasy  TV show or Disney super hero film. 

GRRM takes years to come up with these great stories and characters. The TV writers get what? Weeks? Also they dont even care about the characters.

Have not watched since last episode","YUP.  The last season was so bad, it ruined the rest of the show for me.  GoT was my comfort show.  I'd watch when bored, or trying to fall asleep, or have it on in the background while working.

I haven't watched a single episode since it ended.",I haven't bothered and I probably never will. What's the point? I'll already know that the entire series amounts to nothing.,"I was completely blown away by season 1, then some more by seasons 2 and 3. I bought the S1 collectors edition blu-ray, that came with a dragon egg paperweight (or sth xP) and I've re-watched them several times, but now I feel like I'd pop in the first disc, first episode, first scene; that amazing scene with the first appearance of the white walkers after thousands of years! And I'll be immediately reminded that that, and everything that comes after, amounts to absolutely nothing, no real threat. Arya killed more characters than they did. Then seeing Jaime, who, if we were to jump from the first episode to the very last 2 wouldn't affect the continuity for him (maybe we'd just wonder why he'd cut his hair and why's he wearing a golden glove xD)

I really think the last couple of seasons, and specially S8 kinda ruined re-watchability, which is a disgrace for one considered by myself and almost everyone, one of the, if not the best, TV series ever put to screen. I wanna cry.","Absolutely. 

My husband and I refer to it as the ""single greatest artistic disappointment of our time."" We used to rewatch it regularly with the same enthusiasm we did on the very first watch. 

Now, thanks to the absolute failure that was the last season, our watch has ended.","The last season retroactively killed the entire show for me. Not the books, but the books are on a falling trend regardless.",I'll watch again some day. It's been like watching Anthony Bourdain after his death. I'm just not ready yet.,I’ve opted to read the books instead of a rewatch,"YES!! lol, I have no interest in watching any episodes anymore...I hope that changes cuz I kinda miss it. The last season does not have any rewatch value to me...didnt hate it but have no need to see it again.","Now that I know how shitty the ending is, probably wont watch it again. Just clips on youtube of the hound eating chickens.",Yes this is exactly what happened with me,"I still watch the first 4 seasons, and love them dearly despite knowing the ending.  Still bitter about how they sucked all the personality out of most of my fave characters season 5 onwards though. Reading back its amazing to see how excited people were for Braavos in s.5, they really botched that.",I mean it only aired a few months ago. Re-watching a show or movie after such a short period of time would never enter my mind. I'm sure I'll watch it again in a few years and enjoy it.,"As many other people have said before me, season 8 failed the ending so badly that it retroactively ruined the rest of the show.",There's no reason for me to ever watch this show again tbh.,"Only the first 4 seasons exist to me. I’m not a book reader, it just feels like a whole different show afterwards.

It’s not that I’m not happy with the end. I’d never be happy with it. It’s the writing and how it got there. Just wasn’t true to the tone of GOT. So much plot armor and awful dialogue","If i ever re-watch the show i will stop at season 8.

I'll pretend the show ended after the white walkers brought down the wall",I spent a decent amount of money on merchandise. Ive seen some cool things that I thought Id buy later. Now after season 8 if I see game of thrones merchandise I cringe at it. Ive been a book reader since the early 2000s.,"I came here today to post this exact same topic. My favourite series of all time has been ruined to the point where I can't even enjoy the earlier seasons knowing that nearly every character arc gets ruined.

Season 8 was just a pure clusterfuck of characters saying and doing things that make no sense whatsoever based on the previous 7 seasons of character development.","There’s no reason to.

Every amazing episode or scene just leaves me sad knowing it amounts to nothing in the end.

I compared the ending as they “Mass Effect 3’d it” but even still I replay those games all the time. The shit ending didn’t actively ruin every aspect of what came before, just the main antagonists (which is what they did to the White Walkers). The character arcs were still great, the universe they built wasn’t boiled down to 2 locations. We’ll just ignore Andromeda though...

I can understand the game of thrones ending being unsatisfying, but it was just straight up terrible. I just can’t comprehend how they managed to fuck it up that badly.","I started a rewatch but lost interest in season 4.  Things I just lived with at the time, especially the mischaracterisation of Jaime, made me insanely cross when I tried to watch in light of season 8.  The build up for the others was frustrating and depressing.  Bronn made me roll my eyes.  I ultimately decided that I really didn't want to sit through Sansa's assault arc and her subsequent transformation into the dark caricature of herself, watch Jon slowly grow more broody and useless or get irritated by Brienne spending a season staring out a window.  I have watched some scenes again though.

Had it ended well, I would have been both rewatching, *and* buying lots of merchandise.","I watched the thing in order, and then I'd watch the last season just before the new season aired.  I watched the whole thing again before S8.  I was very eager for S8 even though S7 was a bit weak for me but yeah, now I'm done.  I won't be watching it or any spin offs again.  

On a positive note, now that the boys were fired from Star Wars there is hope for that new series.",I still rewatch. But Im not as butthurt about the show as everyone else seems to be,"Yeah. Can't touch it anymore. The payoff was so garbage I lost all interest entirely, in the books and lore as well. It's bad.","I haven't watched it since the finale, and have no desire too",Yup. I own seasons 1 to 6. I thought S7 was alright so I waited to buy it. After S8 though I thought I shouldn't waste my money anymore on this show. It went from being my absolute #1 show and telling myself I better not die before this ends to fucking hell D&D are peices of shit. If I forget season 8 it's still a top 5 show. If I consider season 8 its maybe in my top 10.,"Yep, we used to re-watch a lot...and now we haven't seen a single episode since it ended. We used to love picking up on things, catching things we missed before. And now it's not the same.",Agree completely. Rewatching at this point feels like boarding a train you know is going to crash.,"I have had no interest after that final season. Honestly, I can't believe that I just don't care.","I will most likely never re-watch the series ever again. I used to do it before every new season to refresh my memory & also to build hype. However, now knowing how it ends & how so much of it ends up meaning nothing, it just makes that pointless. Why bother doing it?",Yep.  I did the same for lost but never bought the final season after it aired.,"I've rewatched seasons 1-7 at least 6 or 7 times. I liked to do a rewatch before every season as a refresher. One of the things that was so great about GOT was that you could rewatch the show and pick up on new things everytime. For instance, there is that scene between Sam and Jon in season 1 where they are scrubbing tables at Castle Black. Jon talks about how he doesn't know anything about his mother. On a wooden piller behind them, the letters R L are carved. 

I think that I would have a hard time binge watching season 8. I watched each episode in season 8 twice. I haven't binge watched season 8.

I think the last season kind of did ruin binge watching the series for me. I don't really have a desire to binge watch the series now. Maybe I will rewatch in the future, but not at the moment. I just feel that they spent all this time building up to stuff throughout the series and rushed through things the last season. I still don't know who all found out and didn't find out the truth about Jon's parentage in the last season. I thought that maybe everyone would know by the time Jon reached Kings Landing. I know Varys was writing those letters, but he burned the one. Did any of the letters end ipgetting sent? It disappointed me that Cersei and Jamie didn't find out the truth of Jon's parentage.","No, ive already rewatched the full series after it ended and still rewatch episodes randomly every now and then.",I still watch them. Sometimes it's about the journey not the ending.,My Dad. Did because we now know the Series amounts to nothing.,"Yes, haven't consumed any Game of Thrones related media aside from memes since the finale.

I also watched season 8 episode 1 and 2 multiple times before episode 3 came out.  Haven’t watched anything again after episode3. Don’t even think I paid attention that much to the latter episodes, just went through them to do it. 

Agree with folks who are saying merchandise makes them cringe. I bought all my friends with new babies a GOT onesie before season 8. Smh...","Snap. 
I had the same issue with lost, was naive up until the last episode",Yep. Same.,"We started watching with my new girlfriend fromthr beginning snce she never saw the show. This was before season 8 aired.
We were about 3 seasons in once ihad finished season 8. I didnt feel like watching the whole thing with her anymore so we switched to breaking bad.
She finished on her own and didnt like last seasons at all
Not gonna watch again most likely.","I was JUST talking about this yesterday. I used to just put it on when there was nothing else on, or I wasn’t fully paying attention. Not once since it ended.",Yes. Considering the show built up the white walkers so much it does put a damper on that part of the series. I do love watching the events that happen in kings landing though.,"I rewatched the first 4 season days after the finale, had to get that spoiled milk mixed with rotten egg taste out of my mouth. Fuck Dumb & Dumber",Yeah GoT has been out of my mind since finishing. I wasn't too hurt by the last couple of seasons but they aren't as watchable as the first 2/3's of the whole series.,"Yes! Every time I think I want to rewatch I remember how cringy the final season, really the final 2 seasons are!",No. The ending doesnt change how much I loved the show up to that point. I havent read the books like you have tbh. But I hate the Fantastic Beasts and that wouldn't stop me from watching the other movies or reading the books again.,"Yes, I used to love rewatching GOT and I planned on doing a full rewatch after season 8 finished. However, after the way that season went, I havent been able to bring myself to want to rewatch everything. It really sucks..","Yeah I did rewatch it before season 8 aired but after this season, hell no I'm not rewatching this shit. It just BURNS. This was the worst final season of any other show I've ever watched and most shows have bad final seasons. But since Game of Thrones is so big it had more to lose if it didn't end well and the outcome was just nihilistic. Season 8 left a bad taste in my mouth the characters were unlikable this season or thwy were just dumb af.","I just now paused S8.E4... I can’t do it. I can’t. The last two episodes before that were already bad enough and I wished I’d never watched them. 

The dialogs, the character developement, the buildup... everything down the drain! Nothing makes sense anymore. I never thought it was possible for a shows quality to go from so high, to such a low. 

Thankfully I’m reading/listening to the books. They’re beautifully written and I can’t wait to know the real ending.",God damn yall are overdramatic.,"Yes, but that's because of my new busy schedule. I'll get back to re-watching the whole show, including the awesome last season, when I have more time.","It was a yearly thing... start watching the prior seasons & finish in time for the start of the new season.

*Was* looking forward to watching the whole thing when the 8th season is out on blu-ray. Not so much now.","Any Mass Effect fans in here?

So sad that ME was my fave game series and GoT was my fave tv series. Incredible storytelling and emotion throughout, and then the endings....... hard to look at either the same again.","Yeah this is exactly me , so sad",It’s about to be cold outside which is prime GoT watching season. Might rewatch again but before it ended I got so much joy from trying to figure out possible endings that would make sense that no one expected... turns out the end was pretty garbage I’d rather it went full cliff hanger so I could still think about it,"Yes and I still see everyone talking about it and tons of posts for cosplay like it's still on fucking tv.

It's over.
Move onto something else. There are other things to dress up about and talk about
Obsessed does not even cover this","Yup, last season murdered the rewatchablity (word?).","I've done bit catch up sessions a few times, watching everything up to the latest season and then the new episodes, but haven't gone back to watch 1 since the ending.

I had planned to buy the full thing on bluray once they were all out and rewatch later.  I just haven't felt compelled to do so since the ending.  Such a disappointment to an otherwise fantastic show.",Exactly the same thing happened to me and my fiance. We'd rewatch GoT and we've rewatched a bunch of shows before and after - but after the way GoT's ending we haven't seen a second. I remember us both just feeling completely empty after the last episode.,">GoT was my comfort show.

That's the perfect way to put it. I also loved it when I needed to get hype for something.",Bran the Broken having the best story is what it amounts to.,Lol so true.,">the books are on a falling trend regardless. 

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but that's just wrong. Feast and Dance have some of the best prose and POV work of the entire series.

Still better than them staying.","For me, it's more that the mystery is less compelling knowing how lackluster it turns out to be. If you consider that 'butthurt' then you do you I guess. There are plenty of things for people to be dissatisfied with.","I think there are a lot of us here who still greatly enjoy the show and don't consider s7 & 8 to be trash but merely a drop in quality. 

I'm waiting to rewatch once I get the Blu Rays.","I admit it. I was butthurt at first. NK dying in episode 3 was a real shock. I had been completely convinced the dead would eventually make their way to King's Landing, with us learning more about them as the season went on, and that NK would die in the last episode. It's still a good season though. You just have to watch it for what it is and not what you wanted it to be.

""The Long Night"" you practically have to rewatch just to figure out what exactly is going on.","Same, this is far from the first show to have a disappointing ending. It doesn't ruin the show at all for me, I just pretend all of the big plot points in season 8 were better developed. I",They really are.,genuinely asking what made the last season awesome for you? im not saying you cant think that but i just dont really feel like the terrible writing and forgotten/useless plot lines amounted to anything awesome so i’d love to hear what you enjoyed about it,ME3 ending wasn't as empty as GoT I think. The character arcs and general galaxy building they did remained. Mostly it was just the Reaper payoff which wasn't the best but the Extended Cut made up for a lot of it. I still adore the trilogy (I'm ignoring Andromeda because I don't consider that Mass Effect honestly).,I have the same problem.  But at least Bioware tried to fix it.,"Wait, so people can only cosplay (or dress up for Halloween) as characters that are currently on TV?","The Next Generation stopped airing 20 or so years ago.

People still cosplay, people still talk about it and the people involved still love it and are praised by fans both old and new. 

No one will be doing the same for Game of Thrones in 20 years. For a lot of people this was their favorite story. Their favorite entry in the fantasy genre, to act like people should “move on” is absurd. They’re hurt, they’re upset, and they’re going to be voicing their frustrations for a long time to come. Get used to it.","Last season murdered the franchise, I expect. I'll never forgive them for the story arcs they ruined.",Agreed. Though I'll probably still buy it anyway just to see what the fuck was going on in the Battle for Winterfell episode.,To be fair his story was badass up until DnD nullified it,Such a good story he was left out of an entire season.,"When the series is lacking in structure and cohesion, good prose is just masturbatory.",No.  Brienne.  She spent a season standing arpund and waiting for a candle.  Cersei too though.,"Yes, A New Hope",Funny how that's not how its being reported exactly.,"I feel like a lot of what happened in s8 could have been done the same, but vastly improved with more time dedicated to characters talking and us getting to see these things develop. Like, as a small example, what if it took Arya and the Hound three episodes to get from Winterfell to King’s Landing, and in that time we see the Sandor start to realize that this isn’t right for Arya. That she can’t take the same path as him. Maybe even have the topic of exploration come up and have him in some way inspire her to go explore the world instead of staying here surrounding herself with death. That way it’s not just pure whiplash from “let’s go kill her!” to “you shouldn’t kill her...” with no scenes between and with Sandor I guess waiting until the absolute last second to speak up after helping her travel halfway across the dang continent.",Imo S7 was meh S8 was fucking garbage.I cant bring myself to rewatch because if i do ill just be like this is stupid was this supposed to forshadow danny going mad because its a fucking wop.,"The writing didn't fall off a cliff, it's comparable to previous seasons. 

The Acting was phenomenal. The Cast really got it right in Season 8. I don't see any other show coming close to that level of ensemble quality for quite some time. 

The first two episodes satisfactorily wrapped up season 7. It's the hints of callbacks and foreshadowing that make these two episodes.  

The Siege of Winterfell Delivered. I will Arm-Chair-General it til my death, but GOT battles have always been style over substance. It was always going to be pitch black night in a snowstorm, how did everyone else not see that coming? 

Under the Definition of: Awesome, is Arya's Dagger moves.  

Danys Final scene was perfect. Emilia Clarke did her best acting of the series with a monologue and small exchange everyone in our universe NEEDED to hear. This is what happens when you go down the path of 'I'm the only one who knows what's right and good'. Other people 'they don't get to choose'. 

Yeah sure I'll wonder, 'but what about Salladhor Saan?' but that's not going to stop me from giving Game of Thrones a 12/10 rating.",I'm just happy they aren't part of Star Wars anymore.,"Up through the Hodor episode. I take it they didn't know what to do with his character after that, which happened to several other characters in their rush to finish things up.",I get what you're saying but Jon has an entire self-contained arc in Dance and so does Cersei in Feast. The main criticism of Dance being structureless comes from the battle of ice and battle of fire being pushed to winds,"Oh gotcha :)

I guess it just didn't become as infamous as Cersei's wine drinking while staring through a window plot",That's good writing.,I wish that we could have seen Arya and Sandors journey to Kings Landing. I wish that we could have gotten more scenes with charaters. Jon and Davos didn't even get a goodbye scene. I think they could have done a better job with Sansa and Sandor's reunion scene.,"That arc was so gripping...Bran losing everything, inadvertently betraying Hodor, biting off WAY more than he can chew in terms of power...and then he was a complete waste of space for the rest of the series.",I hadn't turned my mind to Cersei as I had no intention of rewatching season 8 :),"I just wanted to see King's Landing under snow.

Anyway.  Long live the Queen",Shit it's based on Fire and Blood?,That's actually a cool logo for the show.,I heard HBO canceled the prequel,I’ve read Fire and Blood and can honestly say I’ve enjoyed it much more than GoT. Anyone who hasn’t read it is missing out ! Can’t wait for this to be turned into an HBO series. Hopefully they learn from the mistakes made in the last season of the hbo series.,"Oh, yay, now we get the prequel that way less people were interested with.

They had like 3 or 4 in the works but cancelled one and this is another,"Less interested in? When the Long Night lasted a episode they pretty much made all that history of the White Walkers irrelevant, all those scenes implying sentience? Nope Night King is just bad, he hates humans.

I doubt HBO is not going to have a GoT Spin off though it way to popular.",When they had the source material they were pretty good.  The second they had to stand on their own.... they were horrible.  That entire Q&A they did the other day pretty much exposes that pretty well.,While giving us one of the worst endings in TV history.,"The love went on for years and years.  Average viewers didn't even notice the show started declining when they left the book material.  They were pretty much all on board until the final season gave them something to be disappointed about.  It's really as simple as that, they fucked up.","I was mistakenly thinking they were referring to new GOT programs, not the originals, so I guess they succeeded.",That doesnt really mean that the product will be good. I thought the Hobbit had great content to adapt but it was bad. Same for the Dark Tower movie.,"There are plenty of examples of terrible adaptations of great source material.  The Hobbit movies were terrible and the book is a classic. The Golden Compass movie was awful, too.","seasons 1 thru 5 were like that - all had the feeling there was so much content they were hard pushed to work out what to cut to condense it down into 10 hour long episodes.  Season 1 and book 1 can be gone through together and match up very well.

By Season 6 the show started to feel like it was struggling to fill the time - characters that would appear for an episode or two to then be written out and not seen again.

Then we got the delays, two shortened seasons and the rush to end it that were partly 7 and definitely 8.

There was a clear drop off after season 5 when the huge volume of published content ran out and it now relied on the screenwriters to produce the rest of the story.",[deleted],"They signed up to adapt a series, not write an original one, with the understanding that GRRM would finish the books in the timeframe that was laid out. Then he didn’t. 

Also in what world is adapting copying someone else’s work?","I get it, but that only works if you completely ignore the last two seasons. We all know Vader was Super powerful, so you can’t just write that Anakin was a halfwit idiot. This is basically the same but the other way around. It just doesn’t work unless you successfully forgot the dumpster fire finish of this series.","I'm in the same boat bud. There's still a shitton of lore and backstory to the WW that I'd love to explore. Sure, S8 may have offed them in a disappointing manner, but that didn't diminish my curiosity for their more in-depth backgrounds.","Horrible? Three of the four episodes with a 99/100 rating on IMDB were created by them with no source material. Yes, the writing wasn't even close to the first seasons, but as showrunners, they runned the entire show and everything else was still almost flawless. (Costumes, score, cinematography, casting, stunts, sets, etc.)","They were movies not books. I'm sure if they were adapted for television with the time to flesh out characters etc., they would have been better.",Notably most of these examples are movie adaptations. I think most great books which have a television show can be adapted to a good if not great television series with half competent writers.,"Season 6 still has a couple of the best episodes in the entire series, though I think that's more owed to the direction than the writing. I can agree with your sentiment, but I think S7 is where the quality really starts to decline and S8 is obviously trash.","Haha, what an AWESOME joke dude, it's clear you were just KIDDING AROUND, not just unable to admit you were wrong, because of what a hilarious joke you pulled! What a trickster.",[deleted],"They're delusional if they thought GRRM would have had the series done by now. No matter what George told them, it was pretty clear the final books would take longer than however long the show managed to survive.",Exactly.,"> We all know Vader was Super powerful, so you can’t just write that Anakin was a halfwit idiot. 

Apparently, you can. That's exactly what Lucas did.","I think the only thing they could do that would change any perception of the original series positively would be to establish how important the knife Arya used was, and that no one realized it was literally the key. It would actually help me enjoy the shitty way they went out a bit more.",Exactly. Thank you.,"Showrunners make sure to hire the right people for the job and they had great people involved in those departments.  That's the beauty of being a showrunner - you get to take credit for the work of others because you're at the top.  Their writing still went way down hill after they left the source material, if you want to do IMDB ratings it's clear as day in the final seasons ratings unfortunately.  There were flashes of brilliance but the show lost some of it's depth as they moved away and their writing abilities and abilities to weave a narrative together were not nearly as strong as the source material.  They were good at adapting things but not at creating things imo even in those big well rated episodes lots of folks were in love with the spectacle even while the story was becoming weaker overall after S6 or so.  Just look at appendages like the Dorne plot which they exited in the most abrupt way possible.",">They were not responsible for the costumes, score, cinematography, casting, stunts, sets - which is probably a good thing.","That doesnt matter, adaptations are very difficult to pull of well, regardless of medium.",What examples of such shows are you thinking of? I'm not sure it's necessarily as easy as you're making out.,"Definitely. Things started falling apart story-wise in season 5.  But you’re right. S6 had some of the most cinematic episodes. But then, they rushed it so that they could move on to a SW project that they (checks notes) have now moved on from","I still think 7 had some of the magic. People may have been teleporting around the world a bit but I love the wagon train scene. 

I also thought the north of the wall mission was cool too.","Season 6 was actually one of my favorite seasons. I wasn't crazy about the Dorne storyline. I thought got a lot of good things in season 6.

-Jon was resurrected
- We finally got a Stark reuinion
- Bran was back on the show
-Sandor was alive
-Uncle Benjen came back
- Jon and Sansa got Winterfell back
- Dany finally set sail to Westeros
- Jon finally got off the Wall
- We got the Tower of Joy scene and confirmation of Jon's true parentage
- Jon was named King in the North
-Arya left Bravoss and got revenge against the Freys etc...
I think the season 6 finale was one of the best episodes in the series. 

I had my issues with season 7, but overall I still like it. Jon and Davos meeting Dany was pure gold.",[deleted],[deleted],"I’m sorry, what’s delusional about it? It’s delusional to think someone who makes a living as an author could write a book in 8-10 years when agreed upon in his contract? I don’t understand how that was supposed to be crystal clear.","> they could move on to a SW project that they (checks notes) have now moved on from

Sadly, it seems we've lost... *checks notes* ... nothing of value.","Jesus, just stop. You make yourself look pathetic.",make better jokes.,"Uhh, because Feast had already taken 5 or so years and Dance was still nowhere in sight when they started casting for the series? It was quite obvious the show would end up passing the books if it ever got to that point, which it eventually did obviously.",Nice.

So no Arianne for me. 

I do wish they’d included Victarion though.",I liked that they decided to cut Lady Stoneheart out of the show (never liked her inclusion in the books) and keep Beric for much longer,"The show absolutely NEEDED the aryanne and young griff storyline. It just ties up so many loose ends especially for varys’s character it makes all of what he does in the books (and would be show had they included this) just make so much more sense. 

And the show was clearly hurt by not having young griff and the giant Dornish plan. Doran sucks in the show he ultimately does nothing, the sand snakes are horrible they also ultimately amount to nothing. All of that could’ve been done better in the show by just including these storylines, even if they weren’t fully faithfully adapted the story just desperately needs the inclusion of these characters or the whole overall plot kinda goes to shit. 

And it’s even more apparent with Daenerys going full mad queen In season 8 it’s clear that that’s something that absolutely will happen in the books, and young griff is likely going to be the catalyst for this mad queen turn rather then it just being Cersei who still ultimately amounted to nothing in season 8.","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

And I wish they included more Tyrells. Just cause I thought Willas and Garlan seemed like cool lads.

Plus the whole Cersei blew up the sept and then Olenna giving up saying that Cersei killed her future/all of the other members of House Tyrell always bothered me. Like, no! You have two more grandsons!! Kind of small reasons , but I liked them nonetheless.","I agree on Vic. 
Dorne is boring as hell in both but Arianne/Darkstar and Aerys would’ve been nice if they added the young Griffin Arianne  plot. 
I wish we got a longer series with FAegon plot.","I agree. Like she has such a large extended family. Lannister, Stark and Arryn all gave distant cadets (Lamnisport, Karhold and Gulltown) but Tyrell and Martell (and Lannister) all have massive cousins still alive. And she is a Redwyne. Paxter and the twins are still alive. Even if you argue that Willa’s and garland didn’t appear we still saw cousins in S4.","I personally think the White Walker prequel would have been more interesting and had a stronger story. 

To me I can't help, but think they decided to go with the Targ prequel just to draw people in with dragons and action scenes.","There were about 4 or 5 spin-offs being considered.

The one about the Age of Heroes/Long Night (codenamed moonblood) actually filmed a pilot episode but has been cancelled.

The one called House of the Dragon is going ahead and will use Blood & Fire part 1 as its source material.

There are a few others we haven't heard much about as well.","Yes, the one with Naomi Watts was to be about the White Walkers. That has been canceled. They've now decided that there will be a series on the Targaryens set hundreds of years prior to GoT.

I have zero enthusiasm for a fire and blood story, especially one based on an INCOMPLETE book pairing. We're waiting on the sequel to Fire and Blood just like we're waiting for WOW/ADOS. The exact same issues that cropped up in telling the story of ASOIAF will be there from the start with this.

I bought some vinyl that looked like brown leather to make the little square patches for the bottom of the tunic and the sleeves. I used a post it note as the template for the leather squares. I just hot glued them on. I cut  the stems off silver thumbtacks and hot glued the tops in the middle of the leather pieces to look like Brienne's costume. 

Then, I got some puffy glue to draw the armor to look like Briennes and used krylon spray paint in bronze to paint the armor.

Condal, and is set 300 years before the original Thrones series, chronicling “the beginning of the end for House Targaryen.” Martin’s companion book Fire & Blood serves as a template for the new series.

The new project is actually a reworking of the rejected spinoff concept from Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman, which officially got the axe back in April.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/gameofthrones) if you have any questions or concerns.*","I never understood the Clegane bowl thing. It never seemed like that was his purpose as a character. He was (imo) a protector, not a man completely blinded by his need for revenge. He had opportunity after opportunity to go after Gregor, and he always chose to do something else. The idea that it was all building up to this fight was BS to me.","I think I'm probably in the minority, but I never wanted the Cleganebowl. I loved Sandor and worried that he would get injured or die. Sure enough he died a horrific death. The Cleganebowl was so hyped that I figured that it would happen. I already had to watch the Hound fall off a hill and be left for dead so I didn't want to have to go through that again. The Cleganebowl was traumatizing to watch. They had to go and bring back Oberyn getting his eyes gouged out ptsd. 

I didn't like the way the Cleganebowl went down in the show. I didn't think the city would be burning to the ground when it took place. I was really hoping that Arya and Sandor would team up and fight off the Mountain together. I thought that if Sandor did die that maybe it would be protecting Arya again. He did help Arya in the end. 

The Mountain wasn't really even his brother anymore. They could have had Sandor kill the Mountain as an act of mercy to end Zombie Gregor's torment. Sandor already had a face off with Gregor in season 1. Also, Sandor had several chances to kill Gregor in the past, but chose not to kill him. There was even a scene where Arya asked Sandor what he would do if Gregor was there. Sandor ended up saying something along the lines of that he would tell him to shut up and go to sleep. Sandor talked so much about killing his brother, but could never bring himself to go through with it in the past. At the end of the day, Gregor was still his brother. Yes, Sandor did want revenge against his brother. However, it didn't seem like it was consuming Sandor anymore by season 6. I think that the best revenge would have been for Sandor to move past his need for revenge and find some semblence of happiness. I found the Cleganebowl to be incredibly tragic. I didn't see the Cleganebowl as something to cheer about when I was watching it. I didn't see it as Sandor winning or beating his brother. It seemed suicidal and waste of Sandor's life. I think Sandor needed for Gregor to be gone for him to feel free of him. Zombie Gregor did need to be put down so someone had to do it. Sandor gave that speach to Arya so he knew that his revenge was a waste. I was hoping that Sandor would survive the series. I wanted to see Sandor kill his brother and it not feel as good as he thought it would feel. 

Sandor did try to find a more peaceful existence when he was with Septon Rey. Sandor did seem more at peace in Septon Rey's community. Sadly, peace couldn't last forever. 

As far as the books go, I don't know if the Cleganebowl will take place or not. Sandor and Gregor already had a fight at the tourney. Maybe if it does take place, it could be more of a mercy kill. I don't even think Zombie Gregor even has a head in the books. I don't know if Sandor will live or die in the books. Book Sandor is younger than show Sandor. The last book might never be released so we might be left to wonder about book Sandor's fate. Sandor isn't officially back in the books either. The ""Gravedigger"" theory seemed confirmed in the show. At least, show Sandor's suffering ended. I really love that character. I wanted Arya to give Sandor a hug in the end when he gave her that talked. I don't think the poor guy ever recieved a hug in his life.",I also thought keeping beric rather than having lady stoneheart was a great decision.,"**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

Also had a theory that Jon and Dany would both die after having a child, and Tyrion would steward the throne until the child was old enough to rule, but that was pushing timeline around a lot.","I feel like I’m the only person who really doesn’t care that Bran ultimately won the game of thrones, albeit the throne is more or less forced upon him. it also seems to be that Tyrion is really more of the muscle in that relationship where Tyrion is really going to be the one ruling just more or less behind the scenes. 

That doesn’t really bother me that’s kinda what I expect from the show and books. At no point in the entirety of reading the books or watching the show did I think that Jon or Daenerys was going to actually get the throne or even obtain what they wanted in the end, because every character in the show and books just simply don’t get what they want, the expectations are constantly being subverted with the way the show and books are written that it’s just not bothersome to me that the most idealistic leader didn’t win the throne.

That’s also just not game of thrones or a song of ice and fire, I can still recognize that season 8 is pretty horribly written which I can agree with you on that but as for which character actually ultimately won, I just don’t think that matters or was ever that big of a deal in the first place.","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

Both continue to wear the same crowns, as Jon describes Stannis' crown similarly at the Wall, and Daenerys wears the three-headed dragon crown as Queen of Meereen.","Not sure if it was a case of  Dany didn’t hold the crown she was after long enough to do that or she viewed crowns as being part of the bad old school rulers she opposed. 

Stanis I can see not being one for the frippery of a crown.  In fact I’d view the series decision to have Renly wear one and Stanis not as a good demonstration of the differences between them.  One was all show.  The other was all functionality.",Why would she need a crown with such glorious  hair,"I imagine Stannis was too bound to tradition to allow himself to be crowned before he actually won the throne.

As for Danerys I feel like it’s a bit more up in the air. Maybe Viserys and the Dothraki influence sort of gave her a subconscious opposition to symbols/claims of authority, like crowns? Her experience with the masters in Slaver’s Bay could’ve further driven this, maybe.

Any professional community is a lot smaller than one would believe. Case in point: I record/produce/am the sound engineer and work with mostly local bands. Do I like all of them? No. Do I think some musicians are just flat-out horrible? Definitely…even some that I’ve previously regarded differently in the past. I know for a fact there are some that have not enjoyed my sound or my production, but no one has flat-out bashed me for it.  But, I will support all musicians because it’s good for the community and any type of peer bashing gets you nowhere real fast. Despite any level of talent, I still have a job to do, will do it well, and keep it relatively mechanical. I will lend constructive criticism where needed, especially in the moment if I truly believe it will yield a better and more enjoyable product - people trust my judgment for the most part. By nature, real talent will eventually emerge and sub-par talent will submerge just as well.

Unless you absolutely suck as a person or have treated me and/or others in the community like shit.

It would show in the years with them no longer being trusted in the same way, being kept on a shorter leash and not having the same creative freedom, receiving smaller projects or being snubbed in favours of other writers and so forth. And for all those that will say ""they are directing a Star Wars movie, how is that backlash?"" the truth is that the contract was signed before S8; we'll have to wait some years to see how the sector reacts, professionally, to them, but trust me, it will react","Because whether it was shite or not, they still led a series to be insanely profitable and popular and placed HBO back on the map.

Please watch this and learn how flawed it is. The only 'subjective' opinion I hold toward the actual ending is >!Bran being king. While I don't like that outcome, him being king!< is not bad writing, it just needed to be set up the right way, which it wasn't, which sums up pretty much the entire season; a lot of potential, but rushed and forgotten because D&D wanted to move on to Star Wars.

There is so, so much more wrong with the entire season than just the ending. I LOVE the idea of >!Dany going mad,!< but yeah that needed at least a few more episodes of buildup, preferably a few seasons-- not a few seconds. All her >!""mad queen moments""!< in the past were all justified in some way, so jumping from those to what happened in the 2nd last episode... is just yikes. Terrible writing.

Anyway, please watch the video, it sums up a lot of what most people think, and I don't want to type it all out.

The finale may have aired this past May, but it was *filmed* in 2018. The cast and crew haven't spent the past year sitting around unemployed waiting for audience reactions to see how people would handle the final season. They moved on, got new roles in films or appearances on other shows, some like Lena even booked new pilots (though sadly in Lena's case it sounds like *Rita* wasn't picked up by Showtime).

S7 was *absolutely* disappointing at the time, but since it was still near the beginning of the descent there was a feeling of ""well maybe S8 will be better"" (although S7 did kill my hype for the S8 premiere TBH). And then it was significantly worse so the anger mounted 

>	but people liked it because the characters they loved ended where they expected them to end.

Quite the opposite - one of the biggest gripes I and a lot of others had with S7 was that main characters suddenly *weren't dying*. The big deaths that the show focused on were relatively minor characters, nothing that would actually affect the plot. Which was clearly just a harbinger for what would continue through S8","For me season 7 was like when you're in a car with a friend and they take a turn down a road that's not on the map because ""trust me it's quicker"". It was super sketchy, but if this unlit road and shaky bridge are the best way to get from one good place to another, so be it.

But it turns out that the friend actually full of shit and now we're lost in the middle of nowhere and we've missed whatever it was we were on out way to.

Season 7 was a big stupid limb I was willing to walk out on only so long as it payed off, and it didn't.","> You really think that the cast wouldn't return in a few years for a big fat paycheck and, a new surge in popularity and for better critical reception from fans?

Yes. As I've said, they've had much longer than us to move on from it all.

And considering how much of the fandom has already said they have no interest in watching any of the prequels despite D&D having no involvement and actual competent writers at the helm, I think you're **vastly** overestimating how popular a ""do over"" season would actually be.

HBO didn't lose anything just because D&D are idiots. The final season got the highest ratings the network's ever got. The Game of Thrones merch still sells like hotcakes despite any critical reaction. Nobody in the fandom blames HBO for the last season's bad quality and the people that unsuscribed to HBO Now when GoT ended were going to do so regardless of whether or not the season was any good. 

They have no reason to redo a whole season, spend tens of millions hiring back actors and crew who've already moved on with their careers, and spend hundreds of millions they don't need to remaking a show when they're already making spinoffs... all just to spite *two* people just because the fandom's still feeling petty.

HBO has also moved on. They've got other franchises that can be hits. They've got Westworld, they've got Watchmen, they've got His Dark Materials and theoretically the GoT prequels if the fans have calmed down by the time they air. They don't need to redo a show that ended on its own terms.

Perhaps it's time for the fans to move on.","[NO SPOILERS] means any comments with spoilers need to use spoiler tags to cover the information. Show tags are black. Book tags are red. Game tags are orange. For more info please check the [spoiler guide](/r/gameofthrones/w/spoiler_guide).

It’s likely he’ll end up on the throne same as the show but in the books there’s hints that the three eyed raven and the children of the forest might be secretly evil and just using bran for their own purposes and him gaining power at the end would be a somewhat dark ending.,"Bran's chapters are typically slower than those found in other characters chapters since there's just for less action in comparison for a crippled boy.

&#x200B;

Aside from his own personal interaction with the supernatural the other purpose for Bran's chapters is a focus on the politics of the North. This was the case in the late AGOT chapters and ACOK is an extension of that. While many would probably find that type of world building dull, they do play a critical role in setting up events for the future. One major event in particular is the politics involving the death of Lord Hornwood and the fate of Lady Hornwood and their lands.

&#x200B;

For discussion of the books (and honestly plot in general) r/asoiaf is likely a better place to post even though there is a lot of hostility towards the show's later seasons there.

EDIT: I do foresee Bran being an actual player in the world will have to wait until TWOW or even beyond. I think that given the show decided to leave out who the Three-eyed Crow (Raven in the show) was before he became the Three-eyed Crow we're going to get a very different Bran in the books.","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

Hence, the transition to GoT inspired. There's more than meets the eye ;)

I just went ahead and edited for clarity - thanks for pointing this out!","Book: Joffrey.  Show: almost definitely Littlefinger.  Besides Arya's trial testimony, there are several reasons.  A persuasive one  is that when LF gives Bran the Dagger, he lies:

> Bran: ""Do you know who this belonged to?""   LF: ""No.  That very question started the War of the Five Kings.""  He had told Catelyn it was Tyrion's, starting the Wot5K.
He could have said Tyrion, Joffrey, Robert, etc but totally evaded the question-- a classic liar's trick.","There's a scene before Joffreys wedding when he is whacking Tyrions book with the valerian steel sword Tywin gave him. 

Tyrion begins to warn him about the sharpness of the blade and Joff says ""I'm not stranger to Valyrian steel"" or some such. 

It is strongly hinted in the books the Joff took the dagger from King Robert's stash of knives and paid the cats paw to kill Bran after hearing a drunken Robert say that's what should be done. To be clear Robert wasnt saying an assassin should kill the boy. It was a memory from a Cersei chapter. Robert thought he boy would be better off dead.

Joff in the books is painted as a boy who got almost no love from his dad and may have been seeking Robert's approval by doing this.","**Spoiler Warning:** All officially-released show and book content allowed, including trailers and pre-released chapters.

Maybe they knew he was going to turn into the 3ER. LOL. I could see Cersei or Jamie wanting him gone.,"No, not in the show.","This is a bit tinfoily, but I think that when Robert decided to ask Ned to be Hand, Littlefinger saw an opportunity to create chaos AND deeply hurt his old enemy.  So he had Lysa write Catelyn  the letter implying Lannisters had killed Jon Arryn.  And before Robert left, he hired the assassin, gave him an identifiable dagger and told him to hide in Winterfell when Robert and Ned left and then kill a Stark, just not Catelyn.  If the assassin succeeded, a Stark was dead.  If not, the assassin was dead and they'd have the dagger and try to identify its real owner.  And LF could blame Tyrion **Lannister**.  Win win.  And if the chaos gave him further opportunities...win win win.  That is the way LF thinks.",Littlefinger,I feel like im having a stroke. This is exactly what happens in the show,But Littlefinger wasn’t with the king’s retinue in Winterfell,Yeah but he sent that guy with the dagger to Winterfell to kill Bran to stir the pot,Word and men don’t travel that fast this isn’t season 8,LF definitely gave it to him,"Okay, so three days after bran fell down from the tower, littlefinger personally gave the assassin his dagger from Kings landing and sent him up halfway across Westeros to take the chance. Word doesn’t travel that fast. Westeros is the size of South America and this is medieval times.","Were we given an exact time frame or are you just guessing? Take it up with the writers because I think they made it pretty clear it was Littlefinger. I don't see what the point of this line of dialogue was otherwise:

>ARYA: You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister, but that was another one of your lies. It was yours.",The show explicitly says that it was Littlefinger's knife.....multiple times...,"I don’t very much trust the writers as they made a habit of making my favorite series shit. Littlefinger being responsible for the assassin just doesn’t make sense. Lying about the dagger to stir tension does. He is a man who adapts to change to stir chaos in the way he sees fit for the situation. But in the timeframe logically that they would have to travel down the kings road, there is no way he could’ve heard about it","In season 7, when they didn’t know what to do with him. In the earlier seasons and books it’s heavily implied Joffrey sent the assassin","Yeah it's a revelation of previously unknown information lol

I was constantly asked if I was okay/ did I want a break.\n\n> I felt that my comfort was the first priority for the crew. Which was really great. I'd been hired through my extras agency because i'd previously done life modelling. The nudity and nature of the nudity was told me before accepting the job.\n\n> That was in 2006. On a relatively budget indie film in the UK.\n\n> I cannot fathom why HBO in 2010 would not have similar principles in place on a major budget production.

This is television, you can do whatever you want! And do it! I urge you to do it!”\n\n> “So I was like, ‘Okay, well, you’re the boss,” Marshall recalled. “This particular exec took me to one side and said, ‘Look, I represent the pervert side of the audience, okay? Everybody else is the serious drama side, [but] I represent the perv side of the audience, and I’m saying I want full frontal nudity in this scene.’ So you go ahead and do it.”\n\n...\n\n> In fact, she says, doing nude scenes was so awful that she drank vodka and cried to get through it, noting that, “Whatever I’m feeling is wrong, I’m gonna cry in the bathroom and then I’m gonna come back and we’re gonna do the scene and it’s gonna be completely fine.” The co-star who played her husband, Jason Momoa, also had a hard time with the scenes, especially considering Clarke’s obvious discomfort with it all. The first rape scene that ran on Game of Thrones, featured on the very first episode, was awful. “He was crying more than I was,” Clarke recalled.\n\n> When she pushed back on doing nude scenes in later projects, however, the producers tried to strongarm her: “You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans.”\n\nYou can do nude scenes and not exploit your actors/actresses and push them to the point where they're breaking down and feel they need alcohol to deal with the scene.""]}","{'f909oyg': [5, ""A lot of actors or actresses who are being exploited may fear refusing to do something that they don't want to do in case it damages their career.

It might be that ambitious members of the dynasty like Renly try to overthrow those superior in the line of succession, but that doesn\'t really change primogeniture. Let\'s say Renly had children with Margaery, then he would have wanted his children to succeed him via primogeniture, no matter how he himself obtained the throne. An occasional disruption doesn\'t change the general rule. And it should also be mentioned that Robert enabled Renly\'s coup somewhat by granting him Storm\'s End, thereby artificially weakening Stannis. He made Stannis so weak that overthrowing him became a real option for Renly.\n\nLast but not least, Renly\'s attempted coup was by no means democratic. Renly was a vassal of the Iron Throne who has accumulated too much power, and had collected many feudal allies like the Tyrells. His ""I am the best suited"" talk is not real meritocracy, the translation is ""Through my scheming I have collected enough allies that I can now make a move on the throne.""... The peasants had no say in who becomes king, which would be real democracy and meritocracy.

One: Gendry had no clue about the lake so he couldn\'t have known where to tell Danny to look.\n\nTwo: The more important one and the fact that seals Jon and Co\'s death. The distance between Eastwatch and Dragonstone. I\'ve seen a few dozen different claims on the distance but one thing stands out. Dragonstone is anywhere from 1200 to 1900 miles away.  At minimum, that is the distance between New York City and Miami.

If each man had a horse, they could have been used as a source of food, Gendry could have made it back to the Wall faster. The 2400-4000 mile flight would still be there, but at least Jon and Co. would have food. Berric could use his sword to light a fire (not sure where they\'d get the wood, but hey DnD already spat in our face) so they could cook said horse meat.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJon died beyond the wall.

Also, there is precedent in the books for a childless widow to continue ruling a house - Barbrey Dustin is a Ryswell by birth and had no children with her husband, but has been the ruler of House Dustin since he died in the Rebellion.  Donella Hornwood also continues ruling after her husband and son die, and various men (including Ramsay) scheme to acquire her lands through marriage.  If we\'re being realistic, even with Willas and Garlan cut out of the show, the claim would pass to one of Mace\'s relatives, who would presumably take the exact same stance Olenna did.

While Leyton himself has been reclusive, he did send his soldiers to join the Tyrell army in support of Renly (which was way more transparently treason than what Olenna did, because Renly\'s claim was clearly inferior to Stannis\'s, as well as Joffrey\'s if you didn\'t accept the rumors of his parentage, and which Renly didn\'t really care about either way.

In the end, she only wanted what she thought was best; a fantasy world which didn’t know how to get. \n\nIn the beginning, she was full of hope and wonder. She was quickly matured by her marriage to Khal Drogo, and this taught her master skills in manipulation; in the TV series, he raped her, yet she turned around, convinced him and his village she loved him, and became a hero in their eyes (and perhaps she did love him; but becoming their hero went against Dothraki culture.... yet she did it.). And when she hatched her dragons, over time that feeling of love and tenderness turned to power and ego. She saw herself as all powerful, mainly due to her dragons; and when her dragons die, we can see that she doesn’t love them as much as she once did, for she continues on with Drogon without much but a thought.\nFinally, she gets addicted to the power. She turns from Breaker of Chains to a tyrant. She becomes addicted to people bending their knees for her; swearing their allegiance. This leads her to turn to quicker ways of reaching her goal for the “perfect world”; by a reign of terror, using her dragons to frighten people into “swearing” their allegiance. In her eyes, she is only furthering her goal, by whatever means necessary, making her a perfect Queen. Of course, we also see the flipside to this by seeing the terrible aftermath of the war, which is meant to leave viewers with a conflicted feeling on Daenerys and leaders in general (and the author of the books was very vocal about his objections to Vietnam, as well, so this only makes sense.) In the end, Daenerys falls victim by seeing only the long-term (her fantasy world) and not the short-term (war and destruction), becomes power-hungry for her world, and falls short to listen to those lesser than her.

They just genuinely rushed it too hard and didn't really look at the characters they had written new stuff for and how that might change things (Dany's increased focus on saving people and her advisors generally giving her decent moral advice makes it far harder to make her go evil believably and Sansa's increased trauma and colder nature make it harder for her storyline to not be a depressing showcase of men writing women.

The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on her bottom, hideous and bloody. Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the muscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her handmaids would need to help her down from her mount.  \nEven the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for sleep.  \nDay followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night . . . \n\nShe is in pain from the constant riding. I am sure that having vigorous sex during this time did not help her incredible pain, but you are framing the situation as if he is the cause of all of her pain. \n\nAnd also you're framing it as if she was definitely saying no to the sex, even though this isn't indicated by the chapter. She was capable of saying no to him when they were first married, so I always took it to mean that she agreed to have sex with him, but that the touching of her open sores made it very painful for her. \n\nOf course being 13 and essentially sold to a man means that all the sex, even if consensual is rape, but that means that half of the sex in Westeros is rape, as all the wives are essentially sold to their husband's families, mostly as children. And the other half are selling their own bodies.""]}",{},{},"{'f7y4rqx': [2, ""> Here's the thing though: why would LF care about fracturing the alliance between the North and the Crown?

BOOM. Religion was everything in a medieval era - it literally governed their every day. How do everyone from the smallfolk up to the highest nobility be like ""wtf you attacked our god? eh ok I guess""? There would be religious-based riots especially when the Faith has been the ones actually feeding the smallfolk of King\'s Landing. Gold Cloaks would have had to be ordered out to enforce increasingly tyrannical suppression, and there would be fighting every single day between them and the Warrior Sons, because it is impossible for the Sept karbloomy to wipe out every single Faith follower despite the show conveniently forgetting they exist after the karbloomy.\n\nThen the nobility. Like, who the fuck does this shamed woman who btw is still accused of treason, incest, adultery and a whole host of crimes, now adding domestic terrorism, deicide AND KINSLAYING to the list, think she is? Before Jaime returned from the Riverlands with the Lannister army, she had exactly one(1) bodyguard - Gregor Clegane (and btw, in a superstitious world where Qyburn lost his Citadel chain for necromancy experimentation, how the fuc did no one immediately accuse Cersei of witchcraft and dark magic when he was clearly called Gregor Clagaine in the show? In the books at least they pretend he\'s a nobody called Robert Strong), all the Kingsguard have been replaced by people loyal to the Faith, and given Tommen was in the Red Keep at the time of the Karbloomy, logically most of them would have survived and would never not in a million years supported a sinner like Cersei no matter how loud she screams that she is Queen. Any remaining nobility would have immediately deserted Cersei after the walk of shame, but after she blew up the center of religion? And her son the supposed king dead? As well as half his government and his family by marriage? They would have scrambled to have her convicted on the spot and executed to a) pacify the smallfolk and b) because they\'d know a person who so openly destroys a marriage alliance and her entire family can never be trusted to respect the feudal system they all operated under. Oathbreaker, kinslayer, kingslayer. At the very least, even if that didn\'t happen straight away, they would have made contact with the remaining Faith leadership and tried to take control of their power too, and perhaps yes, triggered another war of succession. But make no mistake, Cersei wouldn\'t have been crowned with no objections, magic zombie bodyguard or no. She was a consort, not a regnant, even if she\'d been regent for a brief (and disastrous) spell, and after her public shaming, there was no way she would have wielded power in her own name (in the books, this was very clearly shown: she had to ask her uncle to do things for her, talk to Tommen for her to name Robert Strong to the Kingsguard, ask Kevan to summon Taena back to court etc. She can\'t command things done herself anymore). Even Aerys, who had the backing of 300 years of Targ kings behind him, was overthrown when he went too crazy for anyone else to handle, what more Cersei, an adulterous incestuous kinslaying whore who didn\'t have a drop of royal blood, who was *openly shamed* to strip her of her perceived might? Remember, power is a shadow on the wall, it resides where people believes it resides. The whole point of Cersei\'s walk of shame is to lower her so that the smallfolk see her as just another whore, shorn of her crown and her riches, what more the nobility? Once that impression is made, it\'s very hard to wipe away.\n\nOh and you know what? Olenna Tyrell would have immediately rallied the bannermen of the Reach prior to starving out Kings\' Landing and she would have won, because the memory of their precious Queen Margaery, who cared for them when Cersei never did, was blown up by Cersei. That would have won Olenna a lot of sympathy points and given her a righteous cause the Tyrell bannermen (including one of the greatest generals, Randall Tarly) can and will rally behind. And you can\'t tell me Olenna had no descendants left given the veritable litter of granddaughters surrounding her in s3 (the grandsons were probably off doing knightly things or whatever). The Reach had the most prolific bunch of Houses in the Seven Kingdoms. Add to that, the fact that Cersei has no lack of enemies, pretty much every other region would be persuaded to either join Olenna\'s ""rebellion"" as it were, or at the very least sit the damn thing out, because god knows they didn\'t want another Aerys on the throne, and Cersei actually did the thing they didn\'t even know Aerys was gonna do.\n\nAlso, Jaime would have killed her himself. Ya know, because Jaime is actually a character in this scenario and not a plot device puppet for Cersei to mess around with.\n\ntldr literally everyone should be rebelling against Cersei, even with the presence of Gregor Clegaine. Presence of the Kingsguard didn\'t stop the smallfolk from taking their shot at the royal party in s2 after all, and this was an event still in living memory (less than five years ago even). People often don\'t realize how common peasant revolts were in medieval times, esp when the populace is hungry or had their religion ripped away from them.']}",{},"{'f6z8nzb': [2, 'Haha yeah I’m a Cersi fan.
